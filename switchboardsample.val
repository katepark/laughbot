0 B.10: Well, about a year I guess. 
0 A.17: It's, uh, part Chow and part Shepherd and it, - as I understand it, uh, both sides of the, were thoroughbreds. So, she's a genuine Chowperd . 
0 A.19: She has the, the color and the black to-, tongue of a Chow, but, uh, she has the shap-, the shape of the, uh, uh, Shepherd. 
0 B.22: Yeah, yeah. 
0 B.24: Most definitely. 
0 A.37: But it wasn't too long until she, uh, found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning. 
0 B.48: She's definitely ready to get out and run around. 
0 A.51: Uh, she'd rather sle-, sleep outside on the, the cold ground at night. 
0 A.53: But, uh, I do make her come in. 
0 A.59: running from one stake to another, and then attached to that is a, uh, twelve foot leash, 
0 A.63: And, uh, she's the best, uh, burglar alarm going. 
0 A.69: And I have not discovered yet where the, the line is between children and adults. 
0 A.79: Uh-huh. What's her name by the way? 
0 A.83: Mitzi. 
0 A.87: As in, uh, martini. 
0 A.95: Oh yeah. 
0 B.98: Yeah, yeah, it really was. He, uh, apparently had a tough time with it for a little while and then he, he got, he came to accept the fact that Mom and Dad were his company from then on, but, uh. -
0 B.100: Yeah. 
0 A.105: I enjoyed talking about pets with you. 
0 B.110: You too. 
0 
0 B.2: I was a resident, although very young of the sta-, of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state. Uh, so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico. Uh, I know that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive, uh, and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a, the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or, or let it go, one or the other. What is your situation? 
0 A.5: And so, um, you know, I saw it, also as a young student and, and it was very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem. Um, it was, it was, you know, very lovely and, and the people seemed very friendly and, and nice. I have, - actually, I work with, uh, a girl from Puerto Rico and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, um. 
0 A.13: Uh-huh. Yeah, those, are good points, um, which obviously I had never thought about. Uh, I don't know, uh, I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would if, if, - I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory. 
0 A.19: Uh-huh. Well, well actually I thin-, - one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway. So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage. 
0 A.29: Uh-huh. 
0 B.30: And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever. Uh, that I, I think that would be a negative step to make and I think that that they would need to reassess that. Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, uh, in so far that it intr-, it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect. 
0 A.31: Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, um, I was in bilingual education in California and I didn't have any problem with my students but I noticed my, my brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school and he can't speak a word. 
0 B.32: Um. 
0 A.33: And so, obviously it didn't work in California. 
0 A.35: Right. 
0 
0 B.2: Uh-huh? 
0 B.10: this sort of thing. 
0 A.11: Um. Well. -
0 B.18: maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know,
0 A.29: the feeling that it - with, - someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know.
0 A.35: That's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and,
0 B.48: Yes. 
0 B.52: Yes, I think most states do have capital punishment. Yes. 
0 B.54: But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do. 
0 B.62: Yes, a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else. 
0 A.63: Uh-huh. So, it seems like a of people live there, and then through appeals. -
0 A.65: Because I know they do frequently, - I mean they cover, cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.
0 A.75: Uh-huh, wh-, which seems so awful. 
0 A.79: <Laughter> Yes, the other one just seems so terrible. 
0 A.83: Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or, it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison? 
0 B.90: Easiest way out maybe. No, I don't think it's a monetary thing. 
0 A.109: And how they would expect, +
0 A.113: And you wonder why they can't just stop it. 
0 B.132: So would I. 
0 B.134: Yes. Absolutely. 
0 A.139: that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do. 
0 A.141: Anyway, well, you have a good day. 
0 B.4: I'm doing fine. I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now. I'm trying to figure out how I can retire without having to work until I'm ninety-five. 
0 A.5: Yeah. We've been doing that too <laughter>. We're trying to retire in our fifties. 
0 B.8: What is that? 
0 B.10: Well, we've got a pretty good situation, my wife and I, since our property is already paid for. You know, the main things that I like about the uh, <talking> <<someone in background>> the job benefits --
0 B.12: -- would be the, uh, the availability of the health insurance and the availability of, uh, you know, being able to transfer around, inside the organization without having, you know, when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that is working on it, like some companies I know of. You know, they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going, on going project. -
0 A.13: So you work for it T I then <music>. <<pause>> You can't say? 
0 B.26: Well, that could be, I could see where that would be important. 
0 A.29: No. 
0 A.37: But we call it the cafeteria plan, I wonder why. 
1 B.42: Yeah. He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it <laughter>. 
0 A.43: <Laughter> Maybe so. Let's see what else can we do? Changes, -
0 B.44: I'll tell you what we could do. 
0 A.47: Uh-huh. 
0 A.49: You mean, like for health insurance? 
0 A.57: I said, thank you. 
0 B.58: Oh. 
0 A.61: But it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good. 
0 A.65: Huh-uh. 
0 A.67: Um. 
0 B.78: Well, they, they really can't fire you without cause, you know the governments taken care of that, but, um, what I'm looking at is, you know, there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid, and there are some teachers <noise> out there that aren't worth having around as janitors. 
0 A.85: Do they? 
0 B.86: But, you know, you, you get specialized education now, for instance, take computer science. We've got kids twenty years old, right now, that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications. I know we could. And these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches, because there's no comprehensive test that they can take, that would allow them to, to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college. 
0 B.116: Yeah. Well it's tough, but, uh, you know, there are requirements, and quotas, what not, for me to make, but, um, the bottom line on, on that kind of thing is, you know, we have a lot of people, especially in major corporations, who aren't doing a damn thing. They're just there. You know, the work they do could be totally eliminated, and not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything. But, it's just that their jobs are useless. Take, for instance, um, a large construction company I used to work for. Ed Swampers. Swampers is a guy, who's in the union. He's a laborer. And he's assigned to, -
0 A.2: Uh-huh. 
0 B.7: Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy. And you let it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder. 
0 A.8: Oh. 
0 B.15: Yeah. 
0 B.19: Oh. 
0 B.21: Uh-huh. 
0 A.22: And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables. 
0 B.25: Uh-huh. I see. 
0 B.33: Yeah. 
0 B.41: And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something. 
1 A.62: Oh, this is ter-, - you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner. 
0 B.63: <Laughter> Getting ready to eat chicken too. 
0 B.87: Wow. 
0 A.98: Something like that, I think we're, -
0 B.105: Uh-huh. 
0 A.106: So I just thought, - in fact I'm just also, - I'm hearing a siren outside I think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, you know, he has one of those alarms on his car, 
0 B.111: Well, okay. 
0 B.113: Yeah, thank you, it was nice talking with you. 
0 A.124: Bye. 
0 A.1: <Beep> Yes, I saw HOME ALONE with some friends just a couple days ago. I wanted to see it, uh, because there was, uh, much recommended,
0 A.9: Yeah. 
0 B.10: -- usually people tell you how good they are, and you always, you know, end up with expectations too high or whatever, 
0 A.13: Well, the, the problem I had with the movie was the problem I've had with a lot of, uh, I guess, Hollywood movies --
0 A.15: -- which is they are, it's a formula movie, and they're making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula -- 
0 B.22: Yeah <laughter>.
0 A.23: -- and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used. 
0 B.24: Yeah. I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie, because that's, uh, not really the way comedies are right now -- 
0 B.30: Uh-huh. 
0 B.34: Excuse me? 
0 A.37: Um. 
0 A.41: <Laughter>.
0 B.46: -- well, actually Falls Church, Virginia, outside the city -- 
0 B.60: Right. 
0 B.64: rather than -- -
0 B.68: Excuse me? 
0 A.77: Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES. 
0 B.78: Right -- 
0 B.90: Uh-huh. 
0 B.96: Right. 
0 A.97: -- you know, it's a little disturbing the violence in these films, partly it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book --
0 B.122: Right. 
0 B.124: Right. 
0 A.129: -- but, I, uh, I'm truly enough, you know, I'm truly an intellectual snob,
0 A.131: to be going to these kinds of movies, I realize that. I mean, to go to these movies and expect them to be, you know, other than just, just good entertainment --
0 B.148: -- I always like the musicals, and uh,
0 B.150: those ones, that just stick in your head. 
0 A.151: yeah, they leave, they leave some songs with you, I don't know what it is -- 
0 B.158: Uh-huh. 
0 B.160: Um. Okay, well, I guess I got to get going, 
0 B.168: Yeah, okay, well, thank you very much. 
0 B.170: Bye-bye. 
0 Air Force Academy, what would you say? 
0 B.2: Well, I'd encourage it. 
0 A.11: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 A.17: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 A.21: Uh-huh. 
0 B.26: you've got a, your share of student loans that, uh, you're probably going to be paying off or have been or, -
0 B.32: Oh, y-, I mean I know people that graduated, or that I went to high school with that went to civilian colleges and they, they've got twenty, thirty thousand dollar debts, I mean you could have, uh, -
0 A.37: So, it's, it's really kind of crazy. 
0 A.39: Uh-huh. 
0 A.41: Really? 
0 B.44: At just a small, - I mean they, they, they are s-, it is a select, ]
0 B.46: college. 
0 A.51: Yeah. 
0 A.55: Yeah. 
0 B.60: to your child's education and then just when they make, made, make it to the college years it's, -
0 B.70: And, that, - yeah, the s-, - it's the same. 
0 B.80: Same patterns of behavior,
0 A.87: Yeah. 
0 B.90: -- and, uh, that's another big thing I think people get out of college is the appreciation for different point, differing points of view,
0 B.98: Yeah. 
0 A.109: Uh-huh. 
0 A.113: Yeah, it's sort of a, a rare select environment. 
0 A.115: <Laughter>.
0 B.120: But, these M I T grads are off in their absolute own world. It, it's a, - I, I have more re-, I have a lot of respect for M I T master's and doctorate, uh,
0 A.125: Well, I, I had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school.
0 B.126: Right. 
0 A.127: Not realizing that the reputation for M I T is because of the, of the doctorate research,
0 B.136: It's interesting that you mention, - and I didn't think about that before when you were talking, but the service academies have all, all the faculty, uh, for the most part is, is military with a few exchange,
0 A.137: Uh-huh. 
0 B.142: or the, the military itself, it's the future officer corps and so, I hear hor-, horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors, they could never get extra help. 
0 B.144: For me any time I needed extra help any time of the day --
0 A.145: Uh-huh. 
0 B.146: -- I had all my instructors home phone numbers -- 
0 B.150: when I was having trouble with something and, -
0 A.153: And you c-, you know, and you can't blame the professors either,
0 A.155: because you look at their job description, you'd s-, you know, - teaching is third down on the list of importance things and, -
0 A.159: So I'd say go to a, go to a college that has teachers. People who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job. 
0 B.162: Yeah, it's, there's a lot of factors that people don't ever, ever consider --
0 B.164: -- in, in their selection of a college and, uh, I don't know, maybe, I wonder if, if they enter these conversations that people have been having, uh ... -
0 B.4: Now, I sort of take pride in, uh, in the yard, and, you know, how the place looks, and, uh, so I don't mind doing it so much anymore. 
0 B.14: Yeah. 
0 B.18: Jeez, that's --
0 A.25: -- but, um, they put up a nice fence, so we still have a <static> lot of privacy, and we grow a lot of food. 
0 B.28: Uh-huh. 
0 B.40: -- for the benefit of the people uh, uh, doing this work. But, uh, - yeah, I mean, that's a heck of a pla-, - you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there, especially up in Vermont there, you should have, uh, some really nice soil. 
0 A.45: I mean, things the way we grow are carrots, cabbage, that sort of goes to waste -- 
0 B.50: Uh-huh. 
0 A.53: No, it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together, but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans. I guess it's, it's just what scents it gives off, they just don't like each other. 
0 B.54: Huh. 
0 A.57: Yeah <laughter>.
0 A.63: But I don't think the vines. They don't real-, they don't have to be touching or anything, like you say, they cross pollinate just by bees, 
0 B.70: Uh-huh. 
0 B.74: Yeah, when I, - my family used to live in Littleton, Massachusetts, and when we moved in there we had a, a really wet backyard, and, uh, my mom wanted a vegetable garden. So we trucked in, uh, I think it was seven, what was it, cubic, seven yards, cubic yards, I think that's how they measure dirt -- 
0 A.77: Yeah, I have to do that, I want to make some flower beds, and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil. 
0 B.90: Well, you can get, um, you can get pressurized lumber, 
0 A.97: But, I, - yeah, I do want to have a raised bed. I've never, - my flower gardens are always been like on the ground. 
0 A.101: Yeah, this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch and I can tell you there's nothing around it, cement --
0 A.5: Well, I think it's a good idea. I think our justice system needs a major overhaul, and I'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it. But I think they've got a lot of problems. 
0 B.8: And I don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or, or what, but, uh. Sometimes I think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined, and they're too easily swayed by their emotion. 
0 B.16: Uh-huh, that's true. But, uh, I do like the idea of the jury being the, the people who decide in the matter of, uh, if it's a jail term versus life and death --
0 A.19: If they give them all the information. I don't know, when it comes to sentencing phase, I guess they tell them if a guy, if the person has a previous record and stuff. 
0 B.20: Uh-huh. 
0 A.23: -- the judge decides whether or not they should hear it. 
0 A.33: Oh. 
0 A.39: I know they can poll a jury, make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was, but I thought that they all had to agree or else they, it was a hung jury. 
0 A.41: And, -
0 A.43: Yeah, I thi-, I don't know how I feel about that. I think maybe, uh, majority might be sufficient. 
0 B.52: -- like, you know, the old day with the rack. We, they're going to say, Okay, you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars. Well, whose going to really make them. 
0 B.56: So. But I think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of, you know, people from different countries, uh, in as international law also. 
0 A.59: -- for something like that because of the cultural differences.
0 B.62: I don't know how, what it would take to be, come up with a true perfect system, or if one exists. But, -
0 B.70: Yeah, that serves a kind of if they're, I guess, uh, - if you sentence someone to life, life is only forty-nine years, something like that. 
0 A.71: Yeah, I, -
0 B.74: Yeah, although I guess it's, you, you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time. 
0 B.78: Yeah, it's another war zone. 
0 A.79: Yeah. 
0 A.81: I think, I think maybe they ought to just be punished with some, some kind of real punishment, like hard labor for a shorter length of time, you know. 
0 A.87: Yeah. Something besides license plates and tiddlywinks. 
0 A.93: Well, I think that covers it. 
0 B.100: Bye. 
0 
0 B.1: All righty. So, uh, do you think Russia's still a threat? 
0 B.7: Okay, you know, like, how, uh, these two, there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other --
0 A.10: Right. 
0 B.15: -- and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself. 
0 A.16: Right. 
0 B.55: Uh <laughter>, no. 
0 B.57: No. 
0 A.58: I think that's, that's, that's not very likely. But yet you know, as, as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare --
0 A.60: -- on his own people. And I guess that makes sense what you said that, uh, within their own borders they feel freer to do --
0 A.64: Yeah. 
0 B.65: And, uh, you know, there's, there's just, you know, - like people will go, like they, like the U. S. goes and goes into Panama and what, - see I don't believe in war. That's my thing. I don't believe that anybody should die --
0 B.67: -- you know, and so then, you know, you have, - because what happens is, - suppose I'm, I go to war and I'm holding a gun and I'm just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives, you know. But that same person also has a family and, you know --
0 B.87: So, oh, well, I got to go to class now. 
0 A.90: Bye-bye. 
0 A.1: So, what do you think about a year or two of public service? 
0 A.7: Uh-huh. 
0 A.9: Uh-huh. 
0 B.10: they're encouraged to do that, missionary work, and I be-, I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our,
0 B.12: society better. 
0 A.21: -- and I think, um, in fact, i-, if I had to do it all again I, you know, - after that, you know, you never think of it because, - I guess because I paid for all of my college education myself, I never thought about doing that because I had all these college loans I'd started paying back. 
0 B.24: <Laughter>
0 A.29: -- and I thought that was, you know, very interesting and I, I would have thought of that earlier I probably would have done, you know, just like, - is that, is this, is that the Mormon church,
0 A.31: that does that? 
0 B.34: Uh-huh. 
0 B.36: Uh-huh. 
0 B.40: -- and in a time after high school, um, there's kind of a selfishness, I mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, +
0 B.54: Uh-huh. 
0 B.70: I don't exactly recommend <noise>, 
0 A.75: Uh-huh. 
0 A.95: Uh, you know, -
0 A.97: Uh-huh. 
0 B.102: -- you're encouraged to do it because, um, you know, it, it helps you, and, of course, we think it's helping other people. 
0 A.103: Oh, I think it is. 
0 B.104: And so, -
0 B.110: Uh-huh. 
0 B.116: Uh-huh. And <clicking>, -
0 B.126: Yeah. Well, I, I don't know how that would ever happen here but at least, um, -
0 A.145: in the Washington,
0 B.146: Area. 
0 A.151: Yeah, with --
0 A.167: Yeah, that's true. 
0 A.169: That's interesting. Uh-huh. 
0 A.171: Okay. Hey, thanks so much for the conversation. 
0 B.174: Thanks. Bye-bye. 
0 A.7: Yeah. 
0 B.8: You know, the higher echelon. 
0 A.15: Uh-huh. 
0 B.16: You know, that they are not in the home by choice anymore. 
0 A.17: Uh-huh. 
0 A.25: She worked before she got married, but, uh, she, uh, she doesn't believe in, - she's very old fashioned. She doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to. 
0 A.41: You know, like for, for the men that don't have jobs, if, you know, she feels if there is women out there just because they want to do it, - she said, you know, they could stay at home, 
0 B.44: And the house and that kind of thing. That's very true, but then they shouldn't have a family. 
0 B.46: That's what I'm saying, you know, I think it's great that women have a choice today.
0 B.50: -- all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies. There is no need to have children if you don't want them. 
0 A.55: Uh-huh. 
0 B.70: And it was because I had worked for about nine months, and when they were coming home I was going to work. 
0 B.78: And I worked that shift for eleven years. 
0 A.83: Uh-huh. 
0 B.88: And, uh, I really think that if, uh, like after the second World War when women went to work in factories and all that, that was like out of necessity, because the men weren't here anymore. 
0 B.92: Exactly. A man can afford the necessities, a woman affords the luxuries. 
0 A.97: Exactly. 
0 B.102: We really have, and I, I'm not trying to be, uh, you know, a prude or old fashioned or anything, but I, I don't think if you, - unless you earn something and you've worked for it, and you have a sense of pride about it, - because while I did this in, you know, no one gave it to me. 
0 A.113: Uh-huh. 
0 A.117: Uh-huh. Like I've had my, you know, - like I know kids up here that have their own cars and money is just given to them, like they still get their allowance, they are twenty years old and they still get an allowance. Well, I have held a summer job, you know, since I, you know, I was in the eleventh grade, and I have had to take care of my own money, I have my own checking account, I pay for my own life insurance, and I know a lot of kids that don't even know, - I mean I tell them I pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor, you know. 
0 B.124: -- you know, you are going to find out for yourself, but I mean I don't think you should just not listen to advice, even if you don't take it, just listen. 
0 A.135: I think it will be freedom of choice. 
0 B.138: -- then I mean all of us are going to answer to it one day, maybe.
0 A.139: Exactly, yeah. 
0 B.142: I mean no one has said for sure, you know. 
0 B.13: So, I guess, from what I understand the thing could just -- +
0 B.23: Yeah. I don't know,
0 B.33: And, uh, he came within a quarter of an inch of going, uh, to Saudi, - he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock. 
0 A.40: Well, I just, there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace. 
0 A.52: <Children>.
0 B.55: -- it's like any other country, you know, for whatever reason it's, it's actually there. Well, Iraq has had, uh, designs on that place since nineteen twenty-two so, you know, it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up. 
0 A.60: <Whispering>.
0 A.62: Right. 
0 A.64: Right. 
0 A.68: Yeah. 
0 A.70: Right. 
0 B.71: And then, and then they could call the shots for the, you know, period of time until the next strong man came up and, you know --
0 A.72: Right. 
0 B.81: Um.
0 A.82: stay over there because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay. 
0 B.89: got in and got out. I'm not sure, the, the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks I would think is, uh, you know, the, uh, the business with the, uh, the Shiites of all people, you know, in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds because these people evidently are, you know, being killed off by the thousands. 
0 A.90: Yeah. 
0 A.94: Uh-huh. I noticed that. 
0 A.98: expect. 
0 B.103: I mean, uh, uh, the only way that you're going to have peace over there, if, if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them, you know, until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but I don't think we want to make that decision either. 
0 A.108: Well, I guess I better go I have a repairman just came,
0 B.109: Oh <laughter>. 
0 B.8: Yeah. 
0 A.9: Central America <<very faint>>. 
0 B.16: because everything that T I did anyway we, we shipped in and it was worked on down there, assembled, and then sent back here, so, -
0 A.17: Uh-huh, did that have, -
0 B.18: I didn't feel that we really ex-, exploiting them any. 
0 A.33: Right. 
0 B.34: But there are and, uh, of course, now I, I do have to, I remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad, but I mean, it, I think it's just kind of the North American situation . In Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long but I didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing, as Panamanians are just about as <laughter>, as, uh, as as Americans, as far as, uh, creature comforts, you know, they're, uh, they're, they're every bit, uh, - I, I know, when, my, my son was in the Air Force - and he was stationed in Panama, and he married a Panamanian girl, and when she came up here, uh, you know, - she's, y-, kn-, except for the language situation, some of the cultures she's just about an American,
0 B.36: you know, is as far as T V and, and, you know, the, the moneymaking part of it and all that, matter of fact if anything, she's worse. 
0 B.40: Well, you were in Peru? 
0 A.43: this was when the Peace Corps first are started, 
0 A.55: Uh-huh <<very faint>> so. -
0 A.61: No, no, I believe they did because, um, some of, some of the, the Peace Corps, uh, that I knew of, did marry Peruvians,
0 B.62: Uh-huh <<very faint>>. 
0 A.67: Right. 
0 A.69: Uh-huh <<very faint>>. 
0 B.70: uh, r-, -
0 B.72: Uh-huh <<very faint>>. 
0 A.1: So, uh, describe your family budget. 
0 A.13: Yeah, I understand that. We, we have a real similar situation. Ours, uh, have quintupled, at least. So there is a real family budget. 
0 B.28: Uh-huh. 
0 B.30: Um, I've got, uh, two older cars. There both, - one's a seventy-seven and one's a seventy-eight. 
0 A.35: That's cheaper than we pay. 
0 A.37: Well, here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault. 
0 B.40: they have no fault in Maryland also. 
0 B.44: Uh-huh. Yeah. 
0 A.51: Not at all. 
0 B.54: No. 
0 B.56: Not a bit. 
0 B.58: Yes sir. 
0 A.59: Huh. 
0 B.74: -- but Plano, maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas. Everybody else was an import. 
0 A.75: Well, I'm a West Texan. 
0 A.77: Lubbock, Midland Odessa --
0 B.78: Yes. 
0 A.79: -- Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle. 
0 A.81: A different world from down there. 
0 B.94: Yeah. 
0 B.108: <Laughter> Yes, I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety-one. Yes. 
0 B.118: Yeah, yeah. 
0 A.3: You don't? 
0 A.7: Uh, yes. 
0 B.12: Uh-huh. 
0 A.19: yourself. 
0 A.25: Yeah, 
0 A.33: Anyway, uh, time we spend with our children. 
0 B.70: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 B.72: Oh, yeah . 
0 A.75: Well, I remember, - well I'm sure part of it is a male, female thing, you know, 
0 B.88: Uh-huh. 
0 A.97: Looking for arrowheads, and ... -
0 A.109: Not necessarily in that order,
0 A.113: And, that's a little tough for fathers. 
0 B.124: Uh-huh. 
0 A.125: that's somewhat fun. 
0 B.132: I, I always said that if I had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is. <sniffing> 
0 A.135: Well, yeah, and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy. 
0 A.141: Breakfast and run. 
0 B.152: Uh-huh. 
0 B.154: Uh-huh. 
0 B.158: Yeah. 
0 A.171: But it, but it is interesting, 
0 B.176: <laughter> My Mother used to put that curse on my sister. I hope you have kids just like yourself. <laughter> And, my Grandmother must have put that on my Dad because he got my sister, she's just like him. 
0 B.186: <barking> Uh-huh, I know, I don't know how people can afford kids. <throat_clearing> I mean ... -
0 B.188: Uh-huh. 
0 B.190: Oh, yeah. 
0 A.195: And, I understand Six Flags is real expensive now. 
0 B.210: <laughter>
0 A.211: You know, Disney World or Disney Land. 
0 B.218: OH, yeah. 
0 A.1: So, what kind of neat hobbies do you have? 
0 B.4: <Laughter>.
0 B.8: No, no, I've never had any luck with their's. 
0 A.9: Oh really. 
0 A.11: I guess, I guess these are going to croak too. 
0 A.17: Yeah. 
0 B.18: But, I've had to, to get my money back from them and had better luck with, with some of the, the more expensive companies. 
0 A.21: I don't know, do you have Lowe's up there? 
0 B.22: Uh, well, -
0 A.33: Yeah. 
0 A.35: Yeah, yeah, yeah, something like that. Uh, I got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff, so, I'm going to wait on those. 
0 B.36: Oh, they're bulbs for Spring or Fall? 
0 A.37: Uh, probably Spring, but, uh, I don't much care about things like that. I'll, I'll make a little sort of greenhouse, a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in. 
0 B.38: <Laughter>.
0 A.45: They, they just like to get in and dig. 
0 A.47: Oh, they love to dig. I had, I had some, uh, - I don't know what kind they are, I've already forgotten, - just regular old flower seeds and I planted them and I was so, I was so thrilled because they came up, I mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place. And then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that. 
0 B.48: Uh, gee. 
0 A.57: Oh, uh, yeah, right. 
0 A.59: Well, if nobody, yeah, if nobody complains you're all right. 
1 A.67: Yeah, right here, Bambi <laughter>. 
0 A.73: I just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that. Uh, cooking, that's not really a hobby, it's a necessity. 
1 A.79: Yeah, and raising cats. 
0 A.87: Yeah, the Himie is probably the sweetest one. She's, she's just a little sweetheart. 
0 A.93: No, uh, m-, most breeders are in it for the money, so they'll bree-, they'll breed them twice a year and I, +
0 B.94: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 A.97: you're never, you're never rea-, - and, and they, they do a lot of inbreeding too, and so you end up with, you know, kind of strange kittens. 
0 A.103: um, we, - there's not that much call to, for Bombays. 
0 A.105: Um, they're, they're registered but they're not, they're not, uh, they're not show cats. 
0 A.119: and the other two are short hairs. 
0 B.120: Right. Uh, that's nice. 
0 A.129: And, and that she has a whole bunch of kittens. But we have to be careful, uh, you know, we have to get a particular color point, uh, stud. You can't just breed them with anything. We have to get a, uh, we have to get a silver point Himie, so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens. 
0 B.134: Oh dear. Well it really sounds like, uh, uh, a business more than a hobby. 
0 A.135: Well actually, I mean, it, it is a business in a way, but it, it's a lot of fun as a hobby. Especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats. We're, we're about to get another breed, we're go-, we're going to buy a Devon Rex . And I didn't, I don't like Devon Rexes at first. 
0 A.143: Um, yeah, it, it, it's a strange looking cat. Uh, I didn't like them at first. They've got great big ears, 
0 B.4: Um, I would never, I would never have a problem with anyone testing me, but I can understand why people would object. So, I guess, uh, I guess, uh, I'm kind of mixed on it,
0 B.8: Uh-huh. 
0 A.9: and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, but I don't really like having to do it. It, -
0 B.12: That's absolutely right. It, it, uh, I guess it all comes down to, uh, you know, a, a definition of, uh, how much out, outside activities affect your work and, uh, uh, granted, you know, that, - any, any kind of drug use on, on company property and whatnot,
0 A.17: Yeah, yeah, I think so too. But, you know, it's one of those things. 
0 B.26: And, uh, there's, there's a lot involved there. 
0 B.32: um, I think the big-, the biggest problem I've got is, is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment. 
0 B.42: No, that's right. 
0 A.49: Yeah, I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know, 
0 B.52: Absolutely not, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, - if you hired me I'll be, you know, - supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so, uh, you know, let's, let's stick with that original trust, I guess. 
0 B.56: Uh-huh. 
0 A.59: what's going on in the street. 
0 A.63: Well, yes. 
0 B.70: yeah, I, I think you understand what I'm getting at, 
0 B.82: That's right. I even had friends when I was going to college who were in, uh, pharmacy school and they could legally, um, provide medicine to their family mens-, frie-, family members and friends certain medicines were, were legal now I, I, I believe, you know, any of the, any of the ones we would, we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists, 
0 B.90: You too. 
0 A.7: Sure. 
0 B.8: let alone other countries, 
0 B.12: some examples are this, uh, some of the things, like Jimmy Carter's been involved in, uh, a little program to, you know, fix up housing for people. 
0 B.16: a-, I know in the area that I live in, that's run down and beat up, but it could be fixed up and used, 
0 B.20: <Laughter>.
0 A.25: Oh, yeah. 
0 A.27: Oh, yeah, yeah. 
0 B.42: That's true. 
0 B.48: Um. 
0 B.50: Yeah. 
0 B.56: and what it takes to have that good life,
0 A.59: Uh-huh. 
0 A.61: Well, you know, it's just like you say, there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country, and, uh, you know, if, if you could have a thought of something like, uh, like a, uh, uh, a Peace Corps sort of organization. I mean, this would be so useful, just in, uh, for instance, just helping old folks. 
0 A.63: You know, they, you know they need help, they don't have anybody to depend on, and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house, or do minor repairs, or something like that. Y-, -
0 B.64: You know, I've, I've s-, I, - my, my parents are in their late sixties now, and, um, so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore. 
0 B.66: And, it's, it's really hard on them, and the, you know, the thought that I, I see the, uh, the mall rats, you know, walking around the mall, nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long, when they could be doing something to help someone. -
0 A.69: Yeah. 
0 A.71: Yeah, my mom's in the same position, late sixties, and, and it got to the, got to the point where, I mean, me and my brother both were, were gone, and she couldn't maintain the house, without large expenditures of money. 
0 B.76: those doing the work, and those receiving the, the, uh, the services. 
0 A.81: Yeah, well that's, that's the, that's the point we've gotten to, you know. Every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government. And, y-, the government's going to be limited. I, where are they going to get the money? They're going to get it from us. And we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government. 
0 A.83: We don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program. 
0 A.87: and, uh, it was, it was a pretty neat little program. We'd just go out, and they would buy a plot of land, and contractors and builders, and everybody else would donate their, their time, and, uh, the materials were at cost. And we'd put up houses. And, that was kind, that was kind of neat. I, uh, in a way, I think it's a little bit inefficient, but, but it's better than nothing. 
0 B.96: you had to do some work. And, -
0 A Highway. 
0 
0 A.7: Yeah. A real light line, real light rig? 
0 A.13: Mostly trout in the mountains. 
0 A.17: Uh, yeah, very. Yeah, very much there, you know. 
0 B.24: Yeah. 
0 A.25: Yeah, I, I cast a ways. I'm not highly proficient, but it's fun. 
0 A.33: the fly on the end weighs nothing. It weighs less than the line. 
0 A.37: And you whip the line. 
0 B.40: Uh-huh. 
0 B.42: Um. So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some? 
0 A.45: Right. And then you let it carry it downstream. 
0 B.50: and eat it. 
0 A.51: Yeah, exactly. 
0 A.53: Jump at it. Uh, from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern. 
0 B.54: That's a fish? 
0 A.57: Okay, whenever you, - yeah, a lure, a fly. 
0 B.86: Oh, I'm from Midland. 
0 B.88: I went to college at Tech, so. You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing. 
0 A.89: Yeah, yeah. 
0 B.92: I didn't catch anything, but I've been up there <laughter>. 
0 B.100: <Laughter> Yeah, we do most of our fishing at night. 
0 A.113: hearing the crickets, and listening to the birds and,
0 A.115: seeing the squirrels and,
0 A.121: Uh, I probably ought to. I just freeze. 
0 B.130: Yeah. And you get, you get a little more carried away with it, and you move a little closer. 
0 B.132: Yeah. 
0 B.140: <Laughter> I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old. 
0 B.144: The, uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point, - we got him a little pole last year, and just put, uh, - his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up <laughter>. That was what he considered fishing <laughter>. This year, he's gotten to where he can. We, we were at a friend's, uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm, and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal-, we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish. 
0 A.167: is division one. 
0 A.169: Oh, yeah? 
0 A.175: fishing is fun up here. It's not, -
0 B.178: Yeah, 
0 B.184: <Laughter> Definitely more to look at. 
0 B.192: Yeah, I just love the way it looks. I could almost just watch the wa-, - we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much, and if you were there. I mean, it was, - one time we were there, and I guess it was late May, so it was really your spring almost,
0 A.195: Yeah. I-, it gets f-, foamy almost. 
0 B.6: Yeah, I think I was the one who did that actually. 
0 B.10: So, I know, uh, you know, I know about this project, so I got my students to sign up and, uh, apparently a number of them have been participating. 
0 B.34: Oh, I see <throat_clearing>. 
0 B.36: I don't know. 
0 B.40: Yeah. 
0 B.46: And, uh, in fact, I drove a cab when I was a graduate student so I, I knew, uh, the Hispanic part of L A pretty well.
0 B.48: And certainly, you know, knew that problem, knew, you know, knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them, sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that. 
0 B.58: Yeah, uh, 
0 B.70: uh, very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition, but of course, this project is really one to collect a data base of, of, uh, of casual speech, uh, in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like. 
0 A.73: Uh-huh. 
0 B.74: they have, uh, they have a speech signal and what, and what is said. 
0 A.83: you wouldn't have to have a keyboard, 
0 
0 B.7: Oh, that's great, because they don't have it in Florida. In New York they have it. 
0 B.9: I mean, you know, like I say, I'm in New York and we have a state tax as well. So that just cuts even more. 
0 B.13: I think if it were to be, uh, if it were to be, um, if it were to be, <whispering> hold, hold on a second please, someone just walked in the ro-,
0 B.15: <Rattling> If, if it were to be spent in the right way I think I wouldn't be so upset about it, but given that it, that it's not spent properly, I think it's a major problem. 
0 A.26: And by doing so, they're not obligated to anybody. 
0 A.34: Yeah, it's, uh, you know, - right now, they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit. 
0 B.35: I know and that scares the hell out of me. 
0 A.36: Yeah, tha-, that's illegal, see. If, uh, most company, uh, C E O -s were to do that within their private company, they'd be in jail. 
0 A.44: A lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on,
0 B.45: Uh-huh. 
0 B.55: Yeah. 
0 A.56: See, we, we're, we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place. 
0 A.66: Uh-huh. 
0 B.79: My wi-, - I don-, - no graduate students don't get bonuses. 
0 B.81: We're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure. 
0 B.91: Yes, well, yeah, she's not entirely sales, so it isn't, it isn't as lucrative as one would hope, but, it, it keeps us supported temporarily,
0 B.93: until I can get a real salary and then get taxed more. So, I don't know, I d-, I guess, I guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it, <breathing> and hope that it gets better <door>. 
0 A.96: Yeah, it's re-, a rather touchy topic at that, but <laughter>. -
0 A.98: Well that's great. 
0 A.100: You too, and, uh, -
0 
0 B.18: And, uh, so I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I, as I should have, as I really wanted to. 
0 A.19: Your first ones you mean, it,
0 A.21: was this way? 
0 A.25: Uh-huh. 
0 A.27: Oh. 
0 A.29: Right. 
0 B.30: kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around,
0 A.37: Uh-huh. 
0 B.50: A-, and, uh, my daughter is, um, <smack> has moved out of the house. Her and I get along a lot better now that she's moved <laughter> out of the house <laughter>. 
0 B.64: And I'm doing my best --
0 A.65: Uh-huh. 
0 B.72: Um. A.73: She just recently started working then. 
0 B.76: started working. Uh, she worked a job until we moved to our new house and, uh, she quit that job because it was too inconvenient. And,
0 B.78: uh, she starts a new job tomorrow, which should take her out of the house about four days a week. 
0 A.79: Oh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. So, that sounds great. <smack> Well, uh, <smack> we also have five children. 
0 B.82: <Laughter>.
0 B.86: Uh-huh. 
0 B.90: Uh-huh. 
0 B.92: <Laughter>.
0 B.94: Yeah. That sounds great. I've, I've noticed, uh, another thing, um, <smack> when I was younger my father was always working. 
0 A.97: they have to. 
0 B.98: Yeah. 
0 B.102: and I never saw him. 
0 A.103: Uh-huh. 
0 B.104: So, I didn't have much of a role model to go by.
0 A.115: And that does make a big difference. 
0 A.127: you know, we're not none of us like they pro-, portray it on those shows. I mean,
0 B.130: Yeah. I,
0 B.136: Yes. 
0 A.137: But they seem to, they seem to give, uh, quality time to those children when they are together. And, and so, it seems, <noise> it seems for them that it works out all right. So, I don't know. I, I don't think I ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family. So ,
0 A.141: Yeah. 
0 A.145: Uh-huh. 
0 A.147: Yes. It does, 
0 B.152: Uh, well, now I work for Texas Instruments. 
0 B.158: Yeah. 
0 A.161: Uh-huh. 
0 A.163: Which your income would be a lot better,
0 B.164: Uh,
0 B.166: right. 
0 B.174: And, uh,
0 A.183: Uh-huh. 
0 A.187: Uh-huh. 
0 A.193: was able to, you know,
0 A.195: do something about it. 
0 B.196: <Smack> Yeah. I, uh, started back to school. In fact, I was going to school while I was working fifty-one hours a week and that's why I, you know -- -
0 A.199: Well, it puts a strain on everybody, your wife and your family. 
0 B.204: Yeah <breathing>. 
0 A.205: -- when you're s-, when you're working so hard and going to school, too. 
0 A.209: Uh-huh . 
0 B.218: Uh-huh. 
0 A.8: Uh-huh. Well, what type of restaurant do you like, Richard? 
0 A.12: Right. 
0 B.17: <Cough>.
0 A.24: Oh I, -
0 A.30: Uh-huh. 
0 A.44: Uh-huh. 
0 A.66: Right. 
0 A.68: It's all pretty good, isn't it? 
0 B.87: Two ninety-eight a pound. 
0 A.88: Yeah. 
0 A.90: Oh yeah, cheaper, right. 
0 B.91: -- I mean in a grocery store. 
0 B.93: Oh, my gosh. I've got to go to Maine then <noise> <<dishes rattling in background>>. 
0 A.94: <Laughter>.
0 A.100: Right, uh-huh. 
0 A.102: Uh-huh. 
0 B.103: You know <<pause>> --
0 A.104: We went to Gal-, +
0 B.137: And so, -
0 A.140: Oh, yeah, uh-huh. We eat at Shoney's. 
0 B.145: It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning. 
0 B.147: I think it's as much the, the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch. You know, and it's not that far. It's thirty miles. 
0 A.148: Whe-, - out of, which direction? 
0 B.149: Colorado Springs. 
0 B.151: West -- 
0 A.2: Uh-huh. 
0 B.17: -- unfortunately, I wish I could have. 
0 B.41: -- I mean, that's happened -- 
0 A.42: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 A.46: Uh-huh. 
0 B.47: We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials. 
0 B.53: Oh, that's it, and you just might resemble somebody. 
0 B.55: Uh, out here in Texas we had a, a, a, great miscarriage of justice. It was finally, after nine years, it was finally, uh, taken care of. 
0 B.59: -- uh, someone who stuc-, who held up, a, Seven Eleven, I think it was. 
0 B.65: Well, they said it w-, - this, this happened during lunch time. 
0 A.68: Uh-huh. 
0 A.70: Yeah. 
0 B.71: But after nine years, - well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence and proved, to prove that he was innocent. 
0 A.72: Oh, for heaven's sake. So there's nine years of that man's life gone. 
0 A.74: Uh-huh. 
0 B.75: Now that just was not fair. 
0 A.98: Yeah, well, I think pride in our country and our flag is so important. It's important in so many facets of our lives. 
0 A.100: And, uh, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else. 
0 A.102: There's nobody holding them here. 
0 B.103: See how they'd like it under another flag. 
0 A.106: Yeah. 
0 A.112: -- you know, like if a jury, -
0 B.119: Oh, yes, yes. 
0 A.128: Uh-huh. 
0 A.134: Uh-huh. A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do. And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again. 
0 B.135: Yes. They just go out and repeat their crimes. 
0 A.136: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 B.151: Jean, it's been awful nice talking to you. 
0 A.13: I, I, I do it a lot. I have, - I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid. 
0 B.14: Oh, wow. Okay. 
0 A.15: Uh, so, and my father and brother were in it and, and my brother's still in it. And I had periods when I didn't do anything, but in the last ten years I've, uh, my car doesn't go to a shop, you know, it, it, -
0 B.22: Uh-huh. 
0 A.23: -- I do it for fun really and to save --
0 A.29: -- because,
0 B.30: Yeah. 
0 A.33: You know, when I sat there, I, you know, I dropped my car off for tires or something like that. 
0 B.34: Right. 
0 A.35: And so I respect, - they seem to actually have mechanics there. 
0 B.38: Really? 
0 A.39: -- when I did it the next time, I realized the filter was loose and everything, and I didn't like it. So I'm just doing it all myself. I, I, -
0 B.46: uh, oh, timing belts and things like that. Um, I guess the last thing I took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car, um, when we went in for inspection. 
0 B.62: Li-, little things like that, that really start to aggravate you. That, that's a lot of the reason I do my own stuff. 
0 B.64: Uh-huh. 
0 B.66: Sure.
0 A.67: -- after, after an oil change, you know. 
0 B.70: -- right. 
0 A.73: I, I always wonder about that when, when someone does repairs or little things like that, uh, 
0 B.82: And, and, uh, you know, have an idea of what's going on. 
0 B.94: Uh-huh. 
0 B.98: Sure. 
0 B.104: Well, yeah. That, that, - the biggest, you know, that's the three biggest things to me, you know. I-, i-, - number one, you've got to have the tools around. 
0 B.106: If you don't have the, the special tools or, - well, any more the, the testers, that, you know. -
0 B.108: <Laughter> I, I don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting --
0 A.109: Right. 
0 A.113: Yeah. 
0 B.122: -- they had the little door underneath the hood. You just open the door and pop it out. 
0 B.128: Oh, it, it was, it was tremend-, - well it was about seven hours labor. 
0 B.132: And they looked it over and they, they, they thought they could patch it up a little bit, you know, and what not. So they, -
0 A.135: the heat inside? 
0 B.136: Yeah. And it was, it was leaking inside the car,
0 B.144: -- through. -
0 B.152: Yeah. It, it's, - I, I've never heard a good story about, uh, -
0 B.178: Uh-huh. 
0 A.181: And I went out there for five minutes, and I just pushed on the wires. And sure enough, just pure dumb luck, that the connection over by, - it's not the evaporator, the big filter on one side. 
0 A.183: I just pushed that in, and I heard it click. 
0 A.185: And so sometimes you have dumb luck. I, I was, you know, - you could have taken something like that and thought, well, the compressor's not working. Or it would have taken me all day probably if I didn't do that. But --
0 B.190: Uh-huh. 
0 B.194: Well, yeah. A-, - and, and not only from a, from an economic standpoint, just, just pure safety, you know. If you can, +
0 B.8: Oh, yeah. 
0 A.9: I've got about twelve tickets in the mail. Do you have, - you've a few? 
0 A.19: The one, - it's kind of like, uh, - automobile insurance, - the ones, uh, that I think are the highest and important to me, uh, I hope I never have to use them, really per se, although I've used medical a little bit -- 
0 B.26: Oh, yes. 
0 A.31: Right. 
0 A.33: With T I, or somebody else? 
0 B.36: But I say, I wasn't connected with G S I. 
0 A.37: Oh, right, yeah. 
0 B.40: Now, uh, course you get six months, uh, unemployment from the State -- 
0 B.64: Uh-huh. 
0 A.69: Right. You're absolutely right. That's a good one. 
0 B.78: as far as retirement is concerned. 
0 B.80: I've never heard of such a thing. 
0 B.82: Uh-huh. 
0 A.83: And then just add the money together like you do with a four O one account, you know. 
0 B.88: Yes, by all means. Well, what would be the difference between that and social security? 
0 A.95: Yeah. 
0 B.100: Yeah, that, that's what I've done. I, I've bounced around. 
0 B.102: I change. 
0 B.112: Uh-huh. 
0 A.115: Uh, 
0 A.119: if you, - exams. Uh, -
0 B.136: Uh-huh. 
0 A.139: Go right to personnel. They got the forms in personnel and maybe, +
0 A.141: maybe I'll tell you go something you didn't know about in benefits <laughter>. 
0 A.153: Yeah, salary continuation. I think that's a great one, but again a hope I never use that one. 
0 B.160: Uh-huh. 
0 B.8: Uh-huh. 
0 A.25: Exactly. Uh, I'm not sure about Pennsylvania, whether we have it or not. For some reason I was thinking that we do, but it's, you know, it's not very often. I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone --
0 B.26: Yeah, I don't think we, -
0 A.29: Uh-huh. 
0 B.34: they're always in Florida. Florida and Louisiana, I think, and, uh, some of the,
0 A.39: Uh, you know, -
0 A.57: Yeah. 
0 B.60: I mean, they, -
0 A.65: and they do it again, you know. 
0 B.74: I mean, these guys are certainly not going to, uh, be, - they can't, - I mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison. I don't think the parole system is really helping that much <laughter>. 
0 A.83: I think some of them would rather be in jail <laughter>. 
0 A.87: I don't know, uh, I was just going to say something, I forgot what it was. <<pause>> Oh, I don't even remember what it was now. 
0 A.89: In Clarion. Well, I live in Butler, but I'm at c-, I'm at college. I'm at Clarion University. 
0 B.94: -- you know, the, the more, more urban, I mean less, -
0 A.97: Yeah, and that would be pushing it. So, I mean this is definitely a college town. Uh, we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any. Uh, 
0 A.107: Yeah, yeah. 
0 A.109: We're probably about an hour away from Sharon. 
0 B.116: done terrible things to them and killed them and, you know, that sort of thing, you just - like, I don't want that person sharing the Earth with me, you know, I mean, that is just --
0 A.121: Yeah, but you know I look at that and say, well, they should have thought about that beforehand.
0 B.138: And perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off. 
0 B.144: Anyways, but, uh. Yeah, we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared and, and the guy, like I said, he just, uh, said that he took her, but he won't admit that she died or whatever, and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very s-, s-, you know, mandatory life sentences for murder. 
0 B.4: Uh, Latter Day Saints. 
0 B.12: and so, -
0 A.31: -- there was, uh, ex-school teacher that, uh, did a small amount of before school and after school, you know, kindergartners, or half dayers --
0 A.83: Their employees earn almost nothing. 
0 A.85: And that's really, really a shame too because, <<pause>> - do you and your husband both work. 
0 B.90: and maybe another,
0 A.93: that's grand if, if you can pull it off -- 
0 A.1: We're supposed to talk about the Middle East Crisis,
0 A.11: -- in Saudi, why we attacked Kuwait and we we're, why we are still fighting Iraq. 
0 B.12: Well, it's because of oil isn't it? 
0 A.15: But Saddam is, Saddam is a madman. 
0 A.17: Anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people, -
0 A.19: And, 
0 B.24: Uh-huh. 
0 A.27: -- and the Saudis are our allies. We have several treaties and several alliances with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years. 
0 A.29: You know they've been our friends through thick and thin. 
0 A.31: They,
0 A.33: were at the Saudi border.
0 A.55: And uh, one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if, if you could believe a lawyer or if a,
0 A.57: lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up, you know, 
0 B.64: Oh, my gosh <laughter>. Oh. 
0 A.65: And ninety percent of all politicians,
0 B.76: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
0 B.78: Right. 
0 B.80: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
0 A.81: We were there, the Brits were there. 
0 A.87: So honestly if there is, was a well perceived war, world wide this was it. 
0 B.96: Uh-huh. 
0 B.98: that's true. 
0 A.115: It, it astound, you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man, woman, and child money. 
0 B.120: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
0 A.5: I think that's one thing that I would look at if I was putting my grandmother or my mother, uh, in some sort of home. The first thing that I would look at would be their history.
0 A.7: As far as any court cases that came out of there, um, the history of, you know, their doctors, um, their nurses, and things like that. 
0 A.11: Uh-huh. 
0 A.23: Just out of curiosity, what, what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place? 
0 A.27: Uh-huh. 
0 A.31: Uh-huh. 
0 A.35: Uh-huh. 
0 A.37: In pain or something. 
0 B.40: And, um, yeah, that was what I was going to say. It sounds like just neglect all over. 
0 A.47: Uh-huh. 
0 A.61: And I would like to know that there are, you know, just a lot of activities, like you said, you know, just putting a plant in a room,
0 A.69: looking at gray walls. You know,
0 B.74: Right. 
0 B.84: And they will do bingo. Our group does a church service once a month. 
0 A.85: Uh-huh. 
0 A.87: Uh-huh. 
0 A.89: Uh-huh. 
0 B.90: So there are a lot of things. There are places that have a lot of things for them to do. But you really do have to kind of seek it out, you know,
0 A.91: Uh-huh. 
0 B.100: And, uh, I have other friends. It's kinds of neat, they take animals over and let the people pet them. 
0 A.101: Oh. 
0 A.111: You know, that would be something to look for. That's really neat. 
0 B.112: Yeah. Yeah. 
0 A.115: Uh-huh. 
0 B.118: It's just a matter of people not being lazy.
0 B.132: Yeah. 
0 A.141: Uh-huh. 
0 B.148: and tell me something that they did and then the next time I go it's the same thing, you know, 
0 B.150: that, - just somebody to listen to them.
0 A.155: Uh-huh. 
0 B.158: but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate. 
0 B.166: Oh, and he's always got a smile. I mean, he really tries to, brighten up your life. Oh, it's just amazing. 
0 A.171: Like I, I would really like to be a teacher, 
0 B.172: Yeah. 
0 B.174: Me, too. 
0 B.176: Yeah. 
0 A.177: I cry on, I mean, Hallmark commercials. 
0 B.180: I know. 
0 B.184: Uh-huh. 
0 A.187: I meet these kids who are, you know, dropping out of school left and right. 
0 B.188: Yeah. 
0 B.208: Yeah. 
0 B.216: because they've always gone with us, 
0 B.222: and I think it's because they've gone since they were real little, 
1 A.227: Right. 
0 B.230: As we walk through the, the lobby they'll all say, bring her here. I want to see her <laughter>. I would love to hold her. 
0 B.244: Yeah. Yeah there are. And, and, uh, it really helps those people, I think. 
0 B.256: Well. -
0 A.259: Uh-huh. Bye-bye. 
0 
0 B.1: Okay. 
0 A.2: Great. Um, currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program. 
0 B.7: Um, what did you do when you did exercise regularly? 
0 A.8: Well, I had, uh, a little routine that I did for warm ups. 
0 B.9: Huh-uh. 
0 B.23: Yeah. 
0 A.24: It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up. Yes, when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children. 
0 B.45: Really <laughter>. 
0 B.47: Huh-uh. 
0 B.55: Dr. Price? 
0 B.57: Huh-uh.
0 A.58: and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks. 
0 A.70: Yeah. 
0 B.71: That will be very interesting. My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon so, he's really interested in the heart. 
0 A.76: I mean, I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's, that's good for you, 
0 A.80: Huh-uh. 
0 B.81: That's a real good, um, - he talks about that. Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that. 
0 A.82: Yeah. I actually eat pretty much anything that I want. 
0 A.84: And I've had my cholesterol checked and, uh, a few times and I've never been above, like, you know, one-hundred and fifty, 
0 A.86: never. And, uh, uh, I mean, I, -
0 B.18: Although I claim Florida as my home now, uh, I have two sons living down there but I also have two sons living elsewhere,
0 A.25: Yeah, isn't it funny. <laughter> 
0 A.39: <lipsmack>
0 B.44: Well
0 A.45: that's +
0 B.48: mind that too much I'm I'm with the N R A myself. 
0 A.49: Yeah. 
0 B.52: <breathing>
0 A.63: <lipsmack>
0 A.67: Um I would say I'm probably liberal yeah 
0 A.69: yeah 
0 A.73: Well I'll tell you. I I think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag, it would never happen do you know what I mean? 
0 A.79: <lipsmack>
0 A.81: Yeah. 
0 A.87: of being able to display your uh your ]
0 A.89: ideas you know - the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that <breathing> Uh, though I would never even consider
0 A.105: unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but [ I I think that's I
0 A.107: guess that's I thin- that's my opinion Yeah I guess you feel differently. 
0 A.109: Uh,
0 A.111: no but I think that's that's uh it's that's taxpayer's money. <breathing> If somebody
0 B.112: <breathing>
0 A.127: made
0 A.131: Yeah. 
0 A.135: Yeah. 
0 B.150: against that. 
0 B.162: <breathing>
0 A.169: whatever I I think that that's viable. <lipsmack> Um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. I think. Yeah Because, realistically, like for you for you you don't think it's right <breathing> 
0 B.182: Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen
0 B.186: Uh, um so long as it's their possession. Ok, you're you're that's <breathing> fine up to there except that uh, <breathing> th- what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country, 
0 A.189: Yeah. 
0 A.191: I agree there too. I agree with you there too. [ I I the um I I it's I find it you know personally disgusting But
0 A.197: mixed up inside. <breathing> when, -
0 A.203: even you know for instance, the pro life pro choice movement, uh you know <breathing> - I don't know anybody that actually supports abortion, but they
0 A.205: would vote pro choice. 
0 B.206: Uh-huh. 
0 A.207: because you know That's just a disgusting thing you know somebody <breathing> - an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing,
0 B.216: <breathing>
0 A.217: it that's uh that's what I mean, see, mo- - but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing, and it evokes an emotional response. I think <breathing> that's the hardest thing, I don't know if I could ever be a judge, because
0 A.227: aren't
0 B.232: <breathing>
0 A.239: don't know. [ It's very it's it's uh you know It's a it's a topsy-turvy world and it's really something how um political
0 B.240: <breathing>
0 B.248: it can
0 A.249: and
0 A.1: I'll let you go first. 
0 B.2: <TV> Well I think, I don't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes. 
0 B.4: And the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax. So if you're renting a house or doing anything else, you're not actually contributing to the education of your children. And I think that's wrong, I think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system. So, as it turns out, we don't really have a tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it. 
0 A.5: Yeah, I, uh, I spent a couple, uh, years down in, uh, Plano, Texas. 
0 B.16: Yeah, yeah you would be. 
0 B.30: Oh, well that's pretty good. 
0 A.41: uh, him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something. 
0 B.44: Yeah. 
0 B.50: Yeah. 
0 A.57: Yeah, well, they, they've been having some problems, uh, even here in, uh, like Baltimore City which is, a, a, pretty good ci-, goo-, good sized city. 
0 A.59: Uh, they've been putting a lot of, uh, stress on it and of course, speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to, you know, do everything they're supposed to do and of course they've, uh, been cutting the teachers salaries,
0 A.63: all the services are costing more money and, and everything, uh, but the-, uh, a lot of emphas-, now is being put on, you know, when children used to be taught, you know, like, uh, uh, each child is individual, 
0 B.66: Yeah, they need to take things at their own speed. 
0 B.74: You know each child has to learn at his own rate, they can't keep force feeding things to each other and, +
0 B.78: Uh-huh, because he can't do it. 
0 A.101: yeah, about the seventh, eighth grade I, I, I started to, to come around and realize an, and basically I got interested in math,
0 B.102: Yeah. 
0 A.109: Gee. 
0 A.117: And tha-, that's kind of the way they are there. 
0 B.118: Yeah. 
0 B.126: <Laughter> I can imagine. 
0 A.131: And where they had to raise a small animal. 
0 
0 B.14: Yeah. 
0 B.16: Yeah. 
0 B.44: Exactly. 
0 A.47: they can see, you know. You don't see what, you don't, you can't know what you don't see,
0 B.50: Yeah. 
0 A.57: Uh-huh. 
0 A.75: and things going on, you know, I would love to help somebody, you know, 
0 B.76: Yeah. 
0 A.87: Uh-huh. 
0 B.88: It's, uh, it's, it's not like it used to be even in, in the years of my growing up. 
0 B.90: I mean I'm fifty-three years old, 
0 B.102: right and, and it's not the sharing of,
0 A.109: But you can't do that today. 
0 B.110: But today, I mean, you know, it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that. 
0 A.113: Yeah. Even when, when I first moved to Dallas from New York, it seemed like Dallas was so open, you know, everybody left their,
0 B.118: Yeah. 
0 A.127: Uh-huh. 
0 A.129: Uh-huh. 
0 A.133: Uh-huh. 
0 A.135: Uh-huh. 
0 A.139: Wow. 
0 A.169: -- and that to me is worth the extra money --
0 A.175: Uh-huh. 
0 A.187: Yeah, they don't even consider it. 
0 B.188: Or to, uh, you know, do something for someone else. 
0 A.189: Uh-huh. 
0 A.191: To, -
0 B.192: You know, to mothers not being at home.

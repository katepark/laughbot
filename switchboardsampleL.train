1 B:  -- to do that.  So, uh, so on those we just, we just forget about
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 it.  At first I thought, uh, I don't know, you know. 
1 B:   I think that would probably, [breathing] uh, be very possible,
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
1 know.  Gosh.  I think, you know, we should have got him while we
1 A:  Yeah, and it's like, no, we're not provoking it.  No [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, the, the hardest part with that is that it was very, you
1 A:  and they had to settle their sins, 
0 A:   And that was, you know, prior to World War Two.  
1 a Texan I'm talking to?  [laughter]. 
1 B:   Right.  
1 B:   I hate it [groan].

0 A:   Uh-huh.  
1 B:   -- at that time, but, that, that lasts, you know, for a few
0 A:  I don't believe in hunting, and, uh, I just have had my fill of what is
1 right now, so {pause} [breathing], I watch a lot of, lot of JEOPARDY and
1 A:  -- we enjoy it mainly because it, I think it has, it's full of adventure
1 [breathing],
1 your,
0 B:   -- stove and,  
1 A:   -- so we usually had a bite apiece [laughter].  
1 and this, you know, s-, frog strangler that we used to call them, 
0 A:  Yeah {faint}.  
0 whatever.
0 A:  -- he's a singer.  
0 B:  Right.   
1 B:   Because I, I am the type that will always find an emergency

1 A:  Well, good.  
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
1 A:  Well that, and, and,
0 A:  I kind of wondered.  
0 A:   Yes, you do.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:   For some reason, she reminds me a lot of myself [laughter]. 
0 B:   Because he really likes MAJOR DAD and, and MURPHY BROWN all
1 A:   #We do#, it's a good show.  
1 B:   [Laughter]. 
1 that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
0 B:   -- and it's set in post World War Two times and it's about how
1 full three [noise] minutes or not [laughter].  
0 A:  Oh, I don't either.  And you can go to a store and pick out which one you

1 go, Well why you going to go to that trouble, we have this Coleman stove here.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 [laughter].
1 but we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, you
1 B:  It's, you know, it's a game to her, but I, I do not like to do that
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  -- anything like that --
0 Just let these people fight it out --
1 B:  -- they don't seem to have a clue.
0 to keep up with what's going on in the world.
1 A:  Right, well, I tell you, I'm about a magazine junkie.  So this is right up

0 A:  Oh.
0 the, um, stationary bike keeps you toned and is, keeps the stress off of the

0 games, they've won, won nine, which is pretty good because --
1 B:  And, uh, my daughter plays basketball.  You wouldn't know it, would you, 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  -- but from the other team and he said, Christmas came early this year

0 B:  Television news, I'm not interested in their, in them.  
1 too.  #I think,#
0 at least in emergencies and --
1 B:  Had to have something to even it out.  
0 A:  But, uh, we, and then we went camping with them and everything and, uh, we
0 A:  Well [laughter],
0 B:  Yeah, that was, we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Learned about their basketball team [laughter].  
0 B:  That's what I heard.  
0 employed and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've
0 insurance, uh, other, 
0 hunting.
0 A:  Yeah {faint}.
0 A:  -- because I know there's maniacs out there the first couple of days.
0 B:  Oh, yeah, now that one's a fun one.  That, that is fun.  I know that
1 A:  Oh [laughter].  
0 A:  -- for three days every year.  I mean, it's, there's not as much to do up,
0 kinds of cars they drove, the, you know, simple things like central heating
0 lacking because their parents, you know, don't, uh, p-, encourage them to go
1 B:  It's, it's also a way of relieving stress.  My wife kind of laughs,
1 B:  But what I need next is a good table saw.

1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Well we had, uh, I don't know if your son told you, but
1 B:  Oh, okay.  So that will probably make a difference in the reporting
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  So,

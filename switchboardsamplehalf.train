0 like software is only given out to customers, I mean, you can't believe that.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  that's, that's only part of the problem.
1 uh, those that are economically disadvantage won't have the ability to make a

1 of them but one.
0 A:  Oh, I'm in, uh, down here in Sherman,

1 B:  He was really funny.  Both of the ones I met have been really funny guys.
0 right, when they're ready for it, you know, that it will come about.

0 B:  And, they didn't kill as many people in, in forty-five days, and they were
0 B:  Um, I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting, when I do have spare time.
1 B:  That's my case also.  I've got a new born and there's just no time.
0 B:  Because a lot of them are similar.  
0 A:  Yeah.  A lot of times you can do that.  I think, I the pinks, there's like
0 A:  #Pinks and greens.#  Yeah.  
1 B:  And just into everything, so there's not a spare moment.  
1 A:  No, that's okay.  
1 I was like, oh, I don't want to mess those up.
0 A:  this time of year?
1 B:  um, it's beautiful the next day.
1 B:  that, uh, we've had, you know, twelve car pile ups [noise], 
0 B:  on the free ways because,
1 B:  No, no.
0 them on Monday because for little kids it's, it's still kind ever dangerous
0 A:  to be on the side walks because they might be some live wires,
0 why they live here, I guess,
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Mine has got a flat tire, so I'm going to have to do something about that.
1 B:  things of that nature.  I'm probably the best customer. 
0 tables, and, uh, he's been doing a lot of, uh, a lot of decorative type plates
0 background through most of the conversation.  Speakers were reversed but 
0 B:  Oh, my goodness.
1 B:  Yeah, I don't either.  It's not until you have kids, I guess, you
1 but I've enjoyed talking with you.
1 that I, you know, s-, wish, you know, that I could have that flavor but
1 [laughter],
0 your stomach to digest that meat.
1 B:  So, when you prepare a meal, like say on Thanksgiving, what do you?
1 taste because I'm, boy, am I a taste person [laughter],
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  This is my first call.
0 B:  Hello.
0 B:  Yeah, twenty-one {sounds like he is talking to someone other than speaker}.
0 A:  When do you get out?
0 B:  #[Laughter].#
0 A:  And then they come in last and they have this whole team, you know,
1 row, row, row and one person rowing, right.
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, that's the way it works.  I mean, that's, that's why they're
0 A:  You know, like all these people are just standing, sitting around, just
0 A:  And it fails and #you're dead.#
1 A:  -- what it is for us to make mark off models, you know.  It's like,
0 B:  Well, when you get, you know, when you get right down to it, the, uh, the
0 one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in
1 I kind of have to trade off, you know.  If you never see it you don't spend
0 you know.
0 It just costs too much, you just can't do it, you know.  So, I don't know,
0 B:  It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get 
1 I guess I would, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.
0 A:  Type things where we're sending people off shore. 
0 be able to really, you know, send children to do that.
0 B:  I thought seriously about joining at that time, I thought it was a

0 B:  Huh-uh.
1 B:  Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and
1 A:  Yeah.  I think, uh, oh, boy [laughter]. 
0 people in Central America.  My daughter-in-law is Panamanian, you know,
1 just don't like them [laughter].
0 you'll spend money so,
0 B:  That's right.  See they make money off of it, whether you use it or not.
0 A:  #so that you# would be paying interest. 
0 A:  That's all right.  Sounds like you have a little one there. 
0 B:  I have two little ones.  Yes. 
1 and he gets it out and I don't even think I know my number [laughter].
1 A:  they figure that, that's correct [laughter].
1 A:  The idea is to use their money [laughter].

0 A:  Yeah.
0 ones {noise like one music note}.
0 A:  All ((righty)).  Uh, I'll just hand it off to you and hobbies in our spare
0 A:  yeah, I've done it before and when I was in hi-, in high school and
0 B:  #Well, uh, uh, smoking and# all that stuff? 
0 A:  but, you know, seems like there's just so many things to do down here, I
0 the, and that sort of movement, and so it's, uh, quite the opposite, so
0 A:  Yeah, that's true that the different places in America that, uh, you know,
0 we'll see you in four years.
0 [barking], that's true, they, I think they look at it as, well everybody,

1 is which yet but,
0 B:  Okay. 
1 A:  We live right by the airport. 
1 baseball player to earn a million dollars?  That's the only thing I found out

1 A:  #in Colorado.#  Yeah for two weeks, it was pretty fun 
0 B:  And one of the best trips we took in last year we, uh, a whole bunch of us,
1 A:  Did you get a lot of sand in your sleeping bag and #everything though
0 B:  #Yeah, we had sand pretty much everywhere [laughter].#
0 warm,

1 A:  Huh-uh.
0 me, because he knows, that I know, what I'm doing.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh,

1 Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things.  Uh,
0 B:  But there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while,
0 A:  [Laughter] That sounds like a good idea.  I notice that, um, since we moved
0 nostalgic older movies,
1 B:  Uh-huh, I'm not that hung up to most things.
0 lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I guess I haven't ever had any trouble with that.  I have more or less, I
0 A:  SESAME STREET comes on from like nine to ten, which is a good time and
0 timing of, of it is good, besides ((the amo-,)) what's on.
0 perhaps, this will be possible.
0 B:  Well, I'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time,

1 B:  Huh.
0 A:  Uh, yeah.
0 A:  Oh my goodness, we might actually get to go to a World Series, huh.
0 B:  That's right, it's kind of like Babe Ruth.
0 A:  I hadn't heard.
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, because we usually get one.  We usually order our tickets way in
1 B:  It's like all right, whose corners is this one.

0 A:  Mitch Snider, I don't know who Mitch Snider is.
0 politicians.  I can't remember exactly what it was.  It was real general
0 B:  That's good, especially since you call that one eight hundred number so,

0 B:  when, you know, these are perfect, so.
0 even.
0 things away, and I just think it's such a hassle, it seems like it would be,
0 A:  Yeah, what, they just don't howl that much anymore.

0 she'll just have the french fries, you know.
0 B:  I was very happy about that because I, you know, I feel the same,
0 A:  I'll tell Laura about that.  
0 B:  Yeah, tell her about that. 
0 B:  Well, ((spinoccoli)), 
1 B:  No.  
0 Mike Riley had.
0 B:  Oh, my goodness.  
1 A:  Right.  
0 A:  Well, they're just head and shoulders above everybody else this year.
0 B:  they play so many sometimes I do think it's going to be more, it's luck
1 A:  Yeah, uh, somebody took the fire out from under them.  
0 B:  Take that,
0 A:  George ((Akals)) and Stacy ((Augmon)).  
0 A:  Their coach may not be there.  I think Jerry ((Tarkenyon)) may be headed
1 A:  Ever since Akeem changed his, uh, first name to Hakeem. 
1 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  They've got good individual players but some are getting old.  Robert
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  because I work, and, uh, I have my dogs and I have a hard enough time,
1 A:  And they all have to have the same one, you know.  And,
1 B:  here kid, this is, this is all you're getting [laughter].  
0 parents there and, you know, helps the students or help the, the kids
0 murders too, isn't there?
1 B:  have kids, you know.  Career, to, to much into my career, you know
0 much that way over the Mideast.  And you have the Palestinian question and
0 just getting lip service much like, uh, the Ayatollah Khomeini.
0 B:  Because they're, because they will have more, uh, encounter with this as

0 the United States with, with the change in attitudes and all that, you know,
1 I'm just)) getting out of the olympics and I'm going to give you back Panama.
1 not used to having them over in six days, you know.
1 B:  Yeah.  They shouldn't leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet.
1 @B:  Well, I tell you what it is.  It's warm where I'm at [laughter].  
0 A:  And, uh, it's got the, you know, the kind of the black freckled things on
1 everything (( )).
0 B:  [Laughter] All covered up. 
1 probably have another sandstorm out there, you know.
1 A:  Hadn't had one like that in a couple of years.  
1 dust storm come in and it started raining, 
0 all the rain start.
1 A:  Well, I am somewhat less than enthused about that, 
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  So.  
1 B:  Exactly [laughter].  
0 B:  Clear across town.  
1 shining and it would be hot down in the, 
0 checked it off on the list --
1 think we should be a little more circumspect about it.  Again, my opinion
0 spending.
0 we're paying almost eight percent sales tax, right now.  Which seems to me
0 B:  Huh-uh.  
0 here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salary
0 B:  I don't think we should ever give them a lifetime income, 
1 B:  Unfortunately. 
1 A:  It, they speak with forked tongue, don't they.  
0 cost more,
0 B:  Huh-uh.  
1 A:  Huh-uh.  
0 A:  That's so awful.  Well, what about in New York.  I guess you've gone that
1 B:  No.  Never been in New York [laughter].  
0 A:  Up in the, back in the east.  It's really,
1 B:  Thirty-one.  You're, you're young [laughter].  
1 B:  No, you're young.  You have a lot of life yet, 
0 B:  They say it has really made a difference, though.  
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
1 It's helped me to think more about some issues that I need to be thinking more
1 tent camping, and we had access to a motor home which is really super great,
1 B:  Yeah, the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary but, uh, 
0 B:  Yeah.
1 size, you know.  If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you
1 B:  Yeah.  That's true.  And they won't raise our taxes.  
1 A:  Ha-ha  [laughter].  
0 A:  Talk to you later.  
0 A:  Uh, let's face it, today's, uh, means of communication, we could, a
1 the best resource,
1 A:  Barney Fife, I guess.  
1 morning, but not the NINJA TURTLES.  I like the old-timey ones,
1 recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good
1 every once in awhile and I don't recognize anybody, so I guess that's a good
1 somebody about gun control.
0 A:  No.  And my fiancee is about an hour from D C, 
1 get it done.
0 B:  And it's about, oh, forty-five minutes north.  And, uh, Dallas is a mess.
1 B:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's bad.  And, and well, in certain parts of town it's
1 A:  Yeah. That's, that's just ridiculous, you know [laughter]. 
1 A:  You know, I mean, it was like, don't you dare stop [laughter].
1 A:  I don't care if there's a red light.  
1 There's a saying down here, all roads lead to south Dallas when you get lost
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 the window and he'd watch a policeman chase someone down the sidewalk.
1 A:  other than maybe a butcher knife,  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  and antique weapons.  (( )) he can shoot a muzzle loader real good.
0 B:  It was sad.  
1 gun.  And to this day they declare that the gun was not loaded.
0 B:  Wow.  
0 B:  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 something,
1 A:  I would be impressed [laughter].  
0 B:  That's right.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  I've seen what comes out of the ocean, and I have no desire to share,
1 hotels with,
0 A:  So, uh, I've been through most all of that.  I've not done much of the no
0 B:  -- still, it's you know, nice to get away from civilization every once in a

0 fallen down yet, and sure enough, after I got out of there a little bit, it
0 B:  -- uh, I did see RED OCTOBER.  
1 haven't been in a movie since [laughter],
0 really, you know, I'd just pick up the paper and we'd go see a couple, you
0 B:  -- but no, we haven't, I haven't been to a movie in, it's been four or five
1 see.
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  Kind of drab. 
0 her.
0 B:  Yep.
1 A:  I, I'll bet they could hold their own in the N B A. 
0 B:  Pretty good.  
0 leave college before they turn seniors.
0 A:  Then does it really benefit anybody -- 
1 B:  I wish I was lucky enough to not want to work [laughter] you know.
0 A:  -- beginning, you know, their life in that respect -- 
0 know, that you did because you wanted to do it because you saw the benefits
1 going to jail for,
0 get now and --
1 and twenty-one.  The numbers keep changing so it's hard for me to remember
0 [breathing] and the only time that I got to see them was on weekends and on
1 A:  Because you ex-, --  
1 A:  But I wouldn't sleep on the ground.  I went into a hotel [laughter].
1 the mother turned around and saw me and took the kid away, you know,
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 [laughter] it was always something, some --
0 to do something like go out [throat_clearing] for the kids and, uh, she'd
1 A:  Yeah, I think you force it on them [laughter].   
0 A:  -- it's strange.   
1 B:  I don't know if that relates to that or not but,    
1 B:  -- but, he'd really kind of well up and be ready to cry over there.
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  -- uh, we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool
0 costing everybody a lot of money.  It's not a major topic of conversation.
0 just won't go to the doctor --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh, I know, I know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I don't know, it's going to be hard to switch.  I think that we're going

1 them happen,
0 B:  -- and I, and the only reason I think I like it now is because I've seen it
0 B:  -- and I think that's, I like that.
0 A:  Okay.
0 B:  -- or somebody like her.
0 uh, any character that they could use.  I mean, you know, uh --
0 A:  -- and, well, of course, another one of their mistakes, I think, is they
0 S-, or Get Well Smart, the female character, Barbara Feldon --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- or something like that, and I think it's the same with your characters
1 A:  Yeah, it's kind of nice [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- we, um, um, and then, you know, couldn't wait for the newspaper.
0 A:  -- Huh?
0 the POST?
0 A:  That was probably the best part of the news, was the, uh, some of the
0 A:  What are you studying?
0 A:  -- that you know, unless you have some way of evaluating it --
0 B:  -- yeah, well, at least, as they told us, uh, two shifts --
0 work there.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- bad news unless you can find a really good one, and those are rare.  But
0 A:  Yeah.
1 way through college, and then, uh, kind of hung them up after college, but,
1 hard Mets fan,
0 B:  Yeah, I,
0 the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route, um, against Boston --
1 B:  -- when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner (( )).
0 putting him in,
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, well I guess they were, uh, I guess they must have been scared
1 B:  Well, that's good, well, they're Brooklyn boys, I guess.
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].
1 but these two were definitely thugs, and they were from Brooklyn [laughter].
1 A:  I love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium.  It's great.
0 they, when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player, they squeezed about
0 A:  Ithaca.
0 B:  So if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of.
1 B:  Actually whoever built the city was an idiot, in my opinion,
0 uh, they, they were fun games to watch.
0 year, I think, if, I think, the young talent really just has to build itself
0 up.
1 almo-, almost starting to age a little bit here, I just, um.
0 B:  Well, that isn't too bad.  Just a couple of hours.
0 B:  Toronto, I mean, I want to go see.
0 A:  Yeah, it's a, it's a beautiful city.
1 A:  -- I mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight
1 get into basketball.  We even have peewee basketball here.
1 B:  Have, have you been out of the country?
0 B:  Right.
1 B:  But, what happens is we used to fight a lot, so there's never much of a
0 B:  Yeah.
0 know, like he wants to be best friends now --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Problem, uh-huh
0 A:  Well, may-, well I've enjoyed talking to you.
0 A:  Well, when it gets cold real fast --
0 A:  Because yesterday was really nice --
1 A:  Oh, is it [laughter].
1 female by any means.
0 B:  Yeah, we got at T I to drive into town and almost buy it undercover at the
0 called.  It has to do with, with airplanes.
0 B:  Eric van Lustbader,
0 actually are giving you information in a novel format, I guess would be th-,
0 B:  [Breathing] You know, you're talking to probably one of the si-, late
1 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].
0 A:  Well, [laughter] I guess you've got a choice.  Either you do life in
0 victimized, what do you do about it?
0 A:  Well, some people just are incorrigible, and there's no way that they can
0 what it's like to be in that position where you are playing, you know, life
0 A:  Right.
0 twisted that you wonder when they get out of there --
1 in a state that absolutely did not allow it --
0 B:  Or parole in, in, uh, fifteen, twenty years.
0 =============================================================================
0 this has been the first opportunity I've had to, uh, be working on my own lawn
0 B:  Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line?
0 A:  Yeah, we grow a lot of, uh, the basic, corn, potatoes.
0 A:  She likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow.
0 siding.
0 don't, and so I feel like the real motivation was something that, uh, most
0 World Order.
1 bit, but,
1 there's so much going on, but, you know, hey, I'm going to pray about it, and
1 A:  Isn't that funny.  I bet they're going to do a lot of research on that.
0 A:  The women I call Annie Hall glasses, but, if, I don't know if they're Annie
0 Z, uh, the Z cars, the Datsun cars end up over the border, and uh --
0 A:  -- Well, it's a big tourist town, you know, don't they, don't people go for
0 A:  -- and she doesn't work, you don't know, you can be better than that.  You
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 not [laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh, I didn't know that about Burlington, I'll have to keep that in
0 A:  Well I did.  Uh, and I'm currently, uh, consulting now so I'm with this,
1 A:  Ouch.
0 expensive or it's the most important coverage --
1 [laughter].
1 that I know, you know,
1 so.
1 B:  I guess, four years.  Yeah, yeah.  It, uh, quite a different world isn't
0 local one.
1 B:  [Laughter]  Oh, I know it [laughter].  
0 down here in Houston, it's, uh, the lines are long.
1 (( )) all evening [laughter].
1 B:  But, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then I'll, I'll vote for the
1 figure it's going to be.
0 B:  -- but we have a real good sense of where it's going.
1 what we prove to ourselves every month, is that we're spending more than we
0 B:  -- because, you know, if we didn't track it, we'd, we'd totally blow it, I
0 we're going to have to put it off for a week --
0 B:  -- and, uh, so, we've, that's, that's the, we're look-, we look it as, as,
1 B:  We're going, we're going through the exact same thing. 
0 we lived that way --
0 B:  And so, the only way to get out from under that is to, is to do some kind
0 A:  Exactly.
0 A:  Right.
1 A:  Catching tree bass, right [laughter].
1 B:  Well, I'm a fisher [laughter].
1 working with my freshwater tackle.  That was real fun.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 really about it.  Mostly just the lakes around here, and I fish to take home
1 something home.
1 B:  -- my daughter caught fish, his daughter caught fish,
1 B:  That's right, I would go from one side of the boat to the other, and, uh,
1 even he started baiting my hook [laughter],
0 A:  -- that spill over so to speak.
0 know, put more money into it.  And I just don't have a whole lot of confidence
0 think we need to worry about, uh, how well the job's getting done.
0 --
0 in the last month.  But we hope that education is first and foremost for the
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Oh, my God [laughter].
0 well, that's it, you know, we're going to kill you.  So it's got to be up to
0 And they know, they just had this, uh, I don't know if it's been in your
0 increase of crime is escalating.  I mean, there are more, look at the, look at
0 A:  Yeah, well, I don't know.  So you going to make a career out of it?
0 someone in there yet, but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing
0 A:  Other things.
1 out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, oh, gosh, you can ride a
0 it's not very safe to get out and walk.
1 B:  Say out, instead of out you say out.  Did you know that?
0 A:  -- and, uh, it was nice talking to you.
0 B:  -- and I'm telling you, the air around Plano here turned blue before the
1 B:  -- I mean, I had to loosen the front bumper --
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 twenty years ago I, I got a real job, and [laughter] I've been doing it ever
0 knew what right equipment I needed, because I used to work in a garage, I
0 idea I needed brakes.
0 A:  Unfortunately you couldn't see it until you pulled the wheel off.  So, they
1 and put some presentations down there, and every time I open my mouth
0 A:  Uh-huh, well, I gathered that.  For some reason the people down in Dallas,
0 right, I do catch myself every once in a while talking along with
1 B:  No, I, I make so much money here at T I that, that we just spend it.
0 pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 really shocked at how nice everything is in our house.  But, we don't, you
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  One of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through G
1 cut and stuff, both of us.
0 for a hundred and thirty-four dollars.
0 them out.  I mean, that's funny.
1 B:  That may not be a bad idea.
0 a jury like that.
1 we don't need to do that.
0 whole church.  So that's right off that same kind of principle.
0 But they figure local elections don't mean that much, I suspect.  So people
0 A:  Oh, certainly, there's a message there. 
1 did, and she did it backwards in high heels.
0 B:  Um.
0 suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just,
1 A:  -- a dollar bill comes out the bottom.
0 Speaker B.
0 B:  And then.
0 A:  Yeah, well,
0 can serve over rice.
1 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.  
0 you don't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to.
1 into different fields, I made an off, off the cuff remark about lawyers,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, I know.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, for myself, I mean, I think that military experience [noise]
1 A:  I didn't make it, I sort of washed out.
1 A:  But, um, I like that because it, it really makes me laugh.
1 A:  Oh, it was hysterical, and just real funny things, you know,
1 A:  I often think, Gee, I wish I had a video camera, because I could sure use
1 Star Spangled Banner,
1 here, I called the station and complained.
0 fan.  I don't know what happened.  I'm just not a football fan any more.
1 season.
0 with Minnesota Vikings.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
1 A:  And, you know, the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties,
1 A:  When it got down in the sixties you were cold down there [laughter].
1 A:  Oh, yes, it's a big difference.
0 B:  Yeah, I think I'll take the area with trees.
1 her, except she's very, very old, but her personality is, is very grating.
0 complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the
1 tows cars.  [laughter]
1 work.
1 me, or something, you know.  [laughter]
0 B:  -- and I tell her, you know, No problem, Mom, always got a place for you.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But, who knows.
0 in (( )) {foreign name} City, in the Philippines.  And, uh, as you know, uh,
1 eat their pets.
0 B:  So the winters would get fairly cold.  The only problem with it is that the
1 bloody thing would sit outside my window and bay at the moon at night
1 [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  You know, with a dog,
1 B:  bringing a dog on the job,
0 what time of night it is, he hears my car stop and he's over here and he's
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 the back, so he runs around the back, then I go in the front door.
1 shot,
1 A:  he likes our food best.
0 A:  Yeah, well, we, I work in a manufacturing plant.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Like that, that business sui-, suit,
1 B:  When it comes to winter though, my, my goal is to stay warm,
0 A:  -- you know, she still does her same function and everything, but, uh,
0 B:  Right, which is like adding another layer.
1 B:  Yeah, I know.
1 A:  I would be one of the women in flats [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Pick up where you left off.
0 A:  You don't want to see it.  It's like three hours long and it just --
1 A:  -- drags on forever.
1 A:  Cause I, I mean, I don't know, it's just something, I think, something we
1 here like, um, three or four times a night on various cable channels
0 first came up here, so I, you know, there's a gap in my T V viewing, but
1 two drama shows that I like.  And I tell everybody, don't call me (( ))
0 I finally said, Gee, this is kind of a waste of time.  And then when A T and T
0 A:  Yeah, and the idea that, you know, if he got in trouble, there's some, some
0 A:  The interesting thing about it is is that from a, uh, uh, an economy
0 squirrelly laws that you can't, you can't take out a, a second mortgage, like
0 A:   Yeah.  
0 B:   -- of testing you over and over and over.  And once you've
0 company I work for is sixty thousand people, plus.  So see I, for
0 A:   -- once every three mo-, it's a rotation.  
0 B:  That's the way to go.  
0 B:  Um.  
0 B:  -- five thousand dollars buys a lot of tires.
0 A:  -- I mean, it had a full size door handle on it and it
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  
1 A:  So, it, it's amazing, even when you abuse them.  
1 roads and I was ruining the car, so I sold it,
0 high school and the grade schools are doing that I see, in a area like ours,
0 at the moment, but a lot of the industry's moving southward.
1 A:  Yeah, maybe the, maybe they'll bring their good schools with them.
0 you're most likely to do better in school.  They're going to help you.
1 getting cut back, and you're getting --
0 would contribute.  See, this isn't a subject that I think a lot about because
1 B:  That's like a hobby, because I don't ever make anybody nothing but me
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  -- and he'll call us up and say, let's go, and so we'll meet, you know,
1 B:  Uh-huh [laughter].  
1 B:  Romance [laughter].  
0 B:  Uh-uh.  
0 A:  THE WATCHERS, you know, they made a movie of THE WATCHERS, here not too
1 B:  I don't like, I don't like scary books [laughter].  
1 day to see if I could, so I can watch the movie [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  I'll tell anybody I'd go to Jazzercize before I'd go to aerobics
0 bicycle --
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  I told him, I said, well, if you do it, you can't shave your hair.
0 B:  Yes, we do.  
1 know, if, if, if there, if you killed the person and it's like, oops, too bad.
0 want to be good kids, they'll eventually end up, uh, more or less victims of
0 years of, of perpetuated nonconcern for human life.
1 B:  They're not my favorite team.  
1 truth to that, but you never can tell.
0 A:  -- it would be interesting to see how he does this year.  
0 A:  [Laughter] And then he'll become an all star.  
1 B:  Right, somewhere else.  
0 baseball and, and advertise products, or they, they charge ten or fifteen
1 A:  Right.  
1 out, they fizzle.
0 A:  Right.  
1 A:  And we have snuck some pretty good size presents in here.  
0 B:  Yeah, that's what's going to hurt us in April, uh, we owe on our taxes and
0 they, they were announced to be a separate country.  But, yet, the, the
0 Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Uh [laughter], no.  
0 B:  -- back and forth and it was not hard and you get, you can get a CAT CAM
1 A:  That's funny.  Well, that's good.  I think we kept it at real good.
1 Lithuania, and we were talking about something tot-, income tax or something.
0 B:  But I'm home with the kids all day and I have really, uh, tried to make
0 A:  Oh, that is hard.
0 of a connotation there of him being, you know, it being a problem.  Like he
0 A:  (( )).
0 A:  And so I stayed with them Monday.  Tuesday they went to that.  Wednesday I

1 Remind me of that now that you mention it #[laughter].#
0 Mother's Day Out, it was like from nine to three so that was a pretty good --

1 B:  Well, maybe, maybe we'll get this question again, and can,

0 B:  Yeah so, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 you may have it at a summer home or somewhere else.  And y-, just because you
0 really know, that's why I think that maybe i-, if not, maybe not just having
0 B:  I just think it should be harder for, for a criminal to get hold of them.
0 A:  Yeah, well, I think, you know, maybe some kind of con-, some ki-, I think
0 A:  I don't see, I don't see what the difference is myself.  You know, getting
0 out there on everybody.  Whether we, we believe it or not, they know

0 A:  So, uh, in fact, uh, our Oldsmobile is a, is a like an old Delta
0 B:  Well, we've always had, uh, Fords.
1 B:  Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 families, uh, and they still want kind of a sports car.  They've been, uh, a

0 cool --
1 a time,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  the, uh, the standard shift.  I fact, I, I remember once we, uh, we, uh,
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Oh, well.  Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say,
0 @@A:  Oh, well.  Well, Bill it's been nice talking to you.
1 interesting.  And I, uh, of course, I don't ever get around to reading them
1 A:  Oh, okay, yeah.  He, um, I must have like fifty or sixty books by him
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  But I, I was, uh, I'm not from here.  I'm originally from Ohio, so I've
0 B:  -- we used to always go to their games, and it was kind of fun.  It's

1 B:  quoting those guys and,
0 experts can be.
1 A:  # [Children] when we moved # here.  And, um, it's getting to be too much

0 A:  That's it. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  # have room to put it.  #
1 A:  yeah, you have more c-, control over it [laughter]. 
0 B:  But I'll probably keep it, keep it a while. 
1 the other mothers here, on my street that don't work, I mean my house is just,
0 me we could get, you know, a four bedroom house in the price range that we want
1 in that area.  She said, You're not going to like it as much as this one
1 A:  I'm going to.  I'm going to tell her, you know, when I have the time
1 [laughter], 
0 B:  And, uh, this was, uh, a f-, a for-, foreclosure. 
1 I can.
0 A:  Right.  Uh, do, do you think the benefits package is fair?
0 A:  # yeah.  #
0 A:  But there's so many people that are so senior and have so much time off, so
0 much vacation time coming, that you will find virtually no one in the plant. 
1 And, uh, write to them all and tell them that they've got an opportunity
1 why I'm not a farmer when I garden though,
0 people from Texas A and M, I don't know, maybe you've heard of A and M down
0 eating pecans though [noise].  Pecans are probably not taken from Virginia,
0 B:  Oh, uh-huh. 
1 A:  Tornados, uh, which is not the right subject,
0 A:  That, that is a key thing for shade --
0 math, uh, Speak and Math, uh, devices.  They, they have had Speak and Spell and
0 Hum throughout the recording in the tape itself.  Speaker B breaths heavy
0 A:  #or, uh,# obviously.  So, but, uh,
1 B:  Yeah.  It sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere
0 school.  They're, they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around. 
0 go on.  And they go to college, etcetera.
0 B:  Well, it seems to me that kids that a-, get out of high school that parents
0 B:  # so # it, it really and there is, there are a lot of Mexican people here
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Right,
0 A:  Right. 
0 A:  Up in the Gaithersburg area. 
0 B:  I started when I was in college.  You know, they always offer credit cards
0 balance on.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 at Christmas.  Then they usually go, then they usually get run up pretty
1 B:  So I thought, man, I don't know if I trust this or not [laughter].
1 B:  It's like, let's see if we can get her to run up her bills [laughter].
1 B:  that's scary.
1 seemed like I was never paying the balance off,
1 B:  Holy cow!
0 A:  #And,#
1 A:  That's true.
1 B:  I'll try to remember that one.
0 A:  Oh, it's not bad at all.  It's, it's a beautiful drive. 
0 A:  # and # the bay is circulating over your head, and you,
0 B:  That's really wild. 
1 and, you know, depending on where it is. 
0 B:  Down by Big Bend?
0 A:  I highly, I highly recommend that, in fact I guess they're bringing that
0 probably more of a guy's movie than a --
1 A:  Yeah, that's what we,
0 that you --
1 or see it by myself at night [laughter].
0 A:  I, just so happen, I guess we just see those, but my wife actually talked
1 first place, trying to pass him off at age forty just was almost more,
1 B:  Don't waste your, even at a dollar movie that one would have been bad.  Oh,
0 A:  -- go see movies because just like Robert Redford was in HAVANA --
0 B:  Yeah, he is good.  I really, I really did like that movie.  I'm a fan of
1 A:  Because, because I mean, what he did was so corny. 
0 B:  I loved it, but most people that I knew didn't like it. 
0 it looked like it was going to be a funny movie.
0 have seen twice.  I went back to see it.
0 A:  or something like that. 
0 movies than I have. 
0 B:  Um,
1 Usually I can talk for hours on most of the subjects ((they pick)).
0 @B:  Okay, our topic for today is invasion of privacy.  So, I got a good one. 
0 A:  Uh, shut my other radio off here [/noise]. 
1 A:  Oh, yeah, that's, that's a good one too.  Yeah,
0 B:  Well, um, I work in the computer science center and so we hear a lot about
0 talk show person.  And there was,
0 w-, you know, what specific things you, you did have to put down.
0 you know, but he said just put N A and he said usually you'll get approved
1 anyway because they just want your money [laughter], they want your card.
0 yourself and there it is.  That's all they really care about. 
0 B:  Oh, I know that there's several people I've talked to that really have a
1 A:  # [Laughter].  #
0 B:  # [Laughter]  # (( )), you know, you just kind of,
0 A:  Right. 
0 A:  # have # everyone, uh, take the test right away and, uh, and hopefully,
1 haven't thought about any of this. 
0 the country.
0 A:  # balancing # the budget. 
0 A:  Oh, my. 
1 B:  Well [laughter],  I, I hope,
0 B:  # is # the one that, uh, limits the amount that, uh, real estate taxes can
1 A:  And I don't think it's working that way, Kathleen [laughter]. 
0 government purchasing could be rationalized where, uh, renting of space could
1 A:  I'm surprised the feasibility study could be done for that [laughter]. 
0 A:  # and # borrowing and I started thinking, now wait a minute.  They're in
0 B:  # wants to # throw out his own rascal. 
0 B:  Oh. 
0 cities it's very expensive. 
0 B:  I know my daughter came home the other night and, uh, she was all excited
1 local recycling center was. 
0 B:  And you just eat when you have something to eat. 
1 A:  Let's see what else they are doing, uh, jeez, I'm all out of recycling
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  That, that freaked me out when it first did that.  I thought
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  So, that gives you kind of an incentive. 
0 B:  I remember doing that when I was a kid. 
0 B:  It's, uh, it's nice, because you know, if you talk to people who grew up
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 you know, everyone and then,
0 A:  Or, or, [laughter],  I don't know because then that's where the insurance
0 company, then if people weren't having to spend these huge amounts of money on
0 A:  I mean, if I can't afford to have some kind of volun-, optional operation
1 not a conservative in his fifties has no brain.  It was something like that
0 overcrowding in prisons, uh, just,
0 A:  # in # order to put more people in, into the jails. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, and there's, uh, there's a lot of people here in Baltimore
0 B:  # Uh-huh [baby].  #
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  And, and that way we can be sure, you know, we can find out the truth, we
0 around but as I said, my money's tight,
0 B:  there's no charge for it.  
1 huh-uh, not me.
0 card unless I really, I'll take write them le-, uh, check for it.
1 A:   Well, you're, you are so far ahead of me.  
0 whatnot, and uh, ever since that, it's just been real difficult. 
1 A:   I make myself do it and if I do it, okay, I don't love it,
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:   Next door, we've got an Austin stone.  Across the street,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 young.  You absorb just about everything that they can throw at you.
0 they used to be years ago or is it just a --
0 the old ones and just files them and --
1 something, 
0 A:  That's true.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  I mean, if you can eliminate any, you're doing,
0 hopefully you can show enough weakness, uh, from the, the, the gun control
0 murders, you know, ideas like that [lipsmack].
0 you have to wait seven days, probably less, because if you have a clean

0 B:   Uh-huh.
1 got a, uh, mountain bike, 
0 B:   Uh, but, you know, up here [laughter], it's only stopped

0 B:  # as a general # rule, I, I don't know why this is but I suspect it's
0 differences or anything and I just, there are differences, whether we like it
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, and I don't think in my lifetime, I'll see a woman president,
0 A:  No, I, I,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Now he's still the governor, Cuomo is?
1 B:  I guess New York is still, still behind the times, not like,

0 and,
0 A:  Uh, with seeing how many kids come home to empty houses,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah. Oh no, that for sure.
0 A:  Right.  Now would you continue, do you work now?
1 [noise] but yes I think so,
0 B:  Does he have a girlfriend?
1 B:  Well I hope so, I mean I look at these toys on T V and I just,
0 B:  Well I liked trolling the best. 
1 biggest grin on his face you've ever seen [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  Relaxing too, huh?
0 I don't know if you would enjoy fishing because,
1 small [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  How long has it been since the first one?
0 B:  The vet called her, uh, a golden mix [laughter], 
0 B:  But she's, uh, she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color, you
0 A:  This, this friend of mine has, th-, well it's the same guy that was
1 B:  Sure.  I used to cycle around the block two or three [laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  Oh no. 
0 I don't, it seems to me like if, if they really wanted to get serious or, you
1 the, the landfills,
1 B:  I think that might give it a little added touch of something, I'm not sure
0 hunting trip and I was there with a couple of buddies and we had filled up a
1 been able to, to confess that to anyone and now I've gotten to confess it. 
1 did it but, you know [laughter]. 
0 B:  -- no one can live down there you know. 
0 that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those
1 B:  Please do. 
0 B:  Yeah, I think, I think that you're right.  It would be the, pretty much the
1 anyone else's [laughter] who was,
0 B:  Yeah, they are, and, and it's really changing the social structure of
1 six or seven people and we were just sitting around drinking beer and the
0 A:  Right.  
0 liable.
0 and goes and shoots somebody I would really have the feeling that they're
0 on, on gun ownership, but I can't see a total ban on it at all.  Uh, because
1 A:  What are you going to do about that.  You got two hundred million guns here
1 line of defense [laughter].
0 B:  If I recall back in the sixties, we didn't tend to run in debt a lot of
0 twenty-five years ago Japan wasn't, uh, [noise] hello?
0 B:  # and # it appears that's the case.  Do you own any kind of foreign car?
0 A:  And that's probably got something to do with what you're saying about the
1 A:  It's, it's, it's easier to, to fight, I guess, when you can find them
0 damaging getting in, getting out, uh, making end runs, allowing more
0 A:  # Yeah {faint}. #
0 B:  # and # they did. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  And, uh, when I got out of school I had to sort of teach myself everything
0 colleges it's not required to take computer courses if you're in, in, the
0 A:  And, uh, we were real happy with them, but all the ones that we ever had
0 [breathing] and quite frankly, we were afraid of the, of the G M small cars.
0 B:  Uh, but, uh, we went on a family trip to Massachusetts and there were five
0 A:  Yeah.  What, we, we sold or we, we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru.
1 mean I was growing up, I was taught when I was growing up, you know, that,
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 right now.  And I think it's showing up in their automobiles.  Their
1 A:  Yes.  
0 a certain person at that dealer's place.
0 A:  I think, I agree.  But I think it ought to be expanded to include children.
0 B:  Yes, very true.  I, uh, I agree with you there.  Uh,
1 B:  Uh-huh {pause}. Yeah, exactly.  Well, anyhow I guess we both agree that,
0 do except quit smoking [laughter].  It's a,
0 B:  # Well, the, #
0 A:  What I think should happen is, uh, any violent crime with a weapon, with a,
0 sit there and I read the paper and I say, sh, you know,
0 do with, I think a lot of times with, uh, the type of sentence that's given.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  So, but since they've done that, since they've limited hunting,
0 B:  he really did enjoy it.  
0 B:  you know, you're not allowed to carry them loaded or anything like that.
1 A:  Okay, so I guess we kind of, we've solved that problem, right? [laughter].
1 crazy about guns myself, but being from hunting families I tolerate them
1 B:  Yeah, I, I seem to remember when I was young that was a problem [laughter].
0 A:  Or how you could afford it.  
0 A:  -- because you can flip through the used car manuals and they'll give you a
0 when I was in, in high school, uh, and it was a big car.  I mean it was like
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, everybody that I've talked to who's ever had a Honda --
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  # so # I have to aim like forty-five degrees off to the,
0 and, and the T V is, um, they can get the camera's just at the time the people
1 you know,
0 B:  # [Laughter]  Yeah.  #
1 junk,
1 [laughter]. 
1 A:  So, uh, you don't see you, uh, taking up, you know, and charging,
1 A:  # [Laughter]  # okay, I've seen a golf club, that's funny. 
0 A:  Likewise, and, uh,
0 B:  Where they just, you know, go through the list, and whenever you pick up
1 A:  And so I just do not answer the phone call. 
0 B:  Right, I'm surprised they don't though.  Uh, I, but I'm sure if they did,
1 and things like that.
0 in there, uh, data that would prevent that person from getting a loan in the
0 convincing the authorities that he wasn't the, the party that was responsible
1 for failing to make child support payments [laughter]. 
0 A:  # that # many women work out of the home now. 
1 A:  That's the kind of, uh, what would it be, uh, uh, calming influence or
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  It's too bad.
0 A:  -- I mean, suddenly when you're free to go where you want to go, it's
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  We've, um, we've bought Pictionary,
1 A:  It really is,
1 A:  Yeah, and gosh, I hope you guys cool off down there.
0 few, but they were the oddity.  And,
0 there's a lot more than there used to be.  And see you never picture yourself
0 A:  Exactly. 
1 @A:  Uh, I don't have a family budget but we do have a budget already
0 when it's on sale, you know, and I, I don't go out of the way, but my fiancee,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 out, whatever needs to be worked out. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  And I know a, a lot of couples starting out, uh, I don't think
1 A:  Yeah, and they say oh, well, we have the money we might as well spend it
1 B:  We seem to agree on everything. 
1 A:  Yeah [laughter]. 
0 B:  # Shrubbery, that # were guaranteed and we had no problem with it. 
1 B:  Huh, so either you or your husband can be warm but not both [laughter]. 
1 A:  Yes [laughter]. 
1 A:  You're really divulging very personal information. 
0 B:  And, uh, it, if, uh, no matter what they do in the, the classroom, if
1 uh, you know, education's wasted on the youth anyway.  
1 program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing, but.  
0 B:  uh, most teachers after they have taught for a very long, especially at
1 if it's socialist, or I don't care, 
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 try to swim out.  You know, kind of like the Bermuda Triangle, we're just
0 B:  Yeah, were you at Baylor?
1 B:  No, no. 
0 I know we had, there's a lot of things we would have done if we'd stayed here. 
0 where did you learn to do that, and he says well I read it in a book. 
1 A:  Oh, wow [throat_clearing]. 
1 B:  Yeah, of course he's, he built the shelves in the, in the garage for me
1 B:  -- and, uh, I think if you didn't stop him, he'd still do it today
0 A:  It was kind of neat to see it finally all come together. 
0 much volunteer as far as separating, oh, paper and bottles, and, you know, cans
0 B:  I don't know what, are they, they're probably doing more than that up
0 have noticed on, uh, on Coke bottles and, and whatnot, we went, I've got some
0 A:  And I guess they can make a, a, you know, it's like working a part-time
0 B:  # it turns out that, uh, # on a, a Sunday morning after a Dallas Saturday
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # Oh, for the steel belted,#

0 A:  You, you don't, you don't hear of many people that's taking their families
0 B:  Oh, that sounds neat.

1 they're so tired, and the carbon, they're overcome by ama-, carbon monoxide
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, that's hard to believe, alright [throat_clearing].
1 B:  Yeah.  Who do you think, uh, Chicago will have quarterbacking now?
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  they didn't really [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  But that's really I guess, what I know about football [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, it sure is [laughter].
1 sports [laughter].
0 A:  and you check those subjects, and you go, well [laughter].
1 B:  My goodness, uh.
1 A:  so we did, you know, we did try, and of course we learned too.
0 B:  Yeah, well, I started working half-time when, uh, they were at the nursery
1 B:  but it's not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 uh, the model, the role models that get the, the, the family issues that get
0 little trinket for each day,
0 A:  We definitely see this, uh, and, uh, it's that grandmother figure, not only
0 dollar homes that are hard to get rid of.  But, and then I've heard pros, it
0 they're gorgeous homes, but, th-, I've never seen so many two story homes and
1 B:  # half # acre lot and you can clip the lawn with a pair of scissors. 
0 lime and spread fertilizer,
0 B:  # and take care of # their lawn as, beautiful lawn, and I come over and
0 A:  Oh, I know. 
1 B:  Is that your version of counting sheep?
0 get any traffic from, uh, National. 
0 A:  Yeah, that's nice. 
0 B:  -- lining up for the approach.

0 A:  Yeah, really [laughter]. 
0 best, uh, draft picks?
0 I can't remember them all now. 
0 A:  # Right.  #
1 B:  When your team keeps getting these stupid penalties,
0 A:  Yeah.  It seems like they blow it. 
0 B:  -- so it kind of runs in cycles, I think. 
1 up, you know [laughter],  this is like, Arkansas people. 
0 B:  Well, this should be, uh, we did pretty well last year, so I'm thinking
0 B:  # and # my mom has never watched football hardly in her life,
0 like it was the height of the, of the, uh, Cowboys empire, so to speak, when,
0 A:  Um. 
0 then they try and do another sequels, some of the sequels,
1 B:  Well, they, uh, they almost didn't make it back in a couple cases
1 A:  Yeah.  No,
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 
0 last movie I seen.  It was good.  I liked that.
0 B:  Okay. 
0 B:  Well that's, I would say that's probably true.  Uh, I know in, in my
0 the changes that you can think of are the most significant?
1 liberation.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 a male chauvinist, or a female chauvinist.
0 B:  Right, and, uh,  
0 that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property
0 watch Baltimore news.  You know, that really makes, I don't really bother with
0 part of the country you only see that perspective.  It's interesting to see
0 ever e-, hardly ever even eat beef until I was about five or six years old.
1 B:  [Lipsmack] [breathing] this isn't just really great hunting country
0 B:  And, and I understand that these magazines, you know, and whatnot, that
0 B:  Uh, no I've only been here for the last ten years, uh,
0 B:  that would be a, to me, a really nice vacation --
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  # s-, # water skiing. 
0 B:  Oh, really. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  # and # then when we-, eventually, when we have kids,
0 A:  Yeah, I find the outdoors very relaxing and, you know, kind of [breathing] 
0 A:  Yeah, I don't agree with that either, the, the Robin Hood approach,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 inner city or the suburbs.
1 white.  We had, uh, no minorities at all.
1 B:  #Um [laughter],#
0 A:  Yeah, uh-huh.
1 get harassed by their peers,
0 B:  Um. but they actually are supposed to go to the library and do their own
0 B:  And three I do think that parents need to be more involved.  I don't know,
1 goes on and then I feel like I can't really complain too much, unless
1 A:  [Laughter] I'm twenty-six.  
0 A:  well, I don't know mu-, that much about it.
0 A:  not really.
1 B:  Right, everybody's got a secret [laughter].  So,
1 B:  And that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved [breathing]
0 A:  Well,
0 hostages that were held at that time?
0 B:  Okay.
0 Have you seen that?
0 A:  And you're usually going to do, you're usually going to go to a dinner,
0 patients there, you can't leave by themselves, because they'll make a weapon
1 similar title like, uh, I don't know some, I don't know, some macho title.
1 A:  I guess, I'm not fond of the action packed movie,
0 B:  you know, or school board wide, or you know what I'm saying, 
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Um, like I say, this all may be in name only, kind of
0 those women sometimes pick up on those kids emotional needs and might, you
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 the problem is, the pay scale.  Probably it's because, you know, women go into
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 do, they're very proud of their state, so they've, psychologically they've
0 that,
0 B:  For it to, and to be adopted and funded, you know, by cities.
0 Americans don't feel like they've had enough representation,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well of course, Dallas is in a great upheaval right now over the
0 fourteen one and ten four one, you know, programs and it's, you know, going
0 back and forth between courts to, you know.
0 play.  He just has a really good ((moves)).
0 A:  They just, uh, work the ball and, uh, [breathing]  pass around, and make
0 B:  I like Danny Ainge okay. 
0 A:  -- hit another team on the way?
0 know you have to have the other players there to complement him.  And finally
0 accomplishment if, if they hit, you know, some three pointers or something.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  -- and, uh, you know, they wash, when they open up the dam and let out

0 lot of potential for, you know, uh, hijackings and things like that, terrorist
1 B:  Well that's okay, she wants to talk about vacations, that's what it is
0 searching for recipes that are different.  Some things are traditional, okay,

0 you could include that in benefits.  Some places aren't very safe to work.

0 some conference, uh, players come from outside of Texas, you know, and play us
0 back, uh, to having true student athletes, and, and that's what I think is a
0 B:  Yeah, so that's, I mean, that's pretty big.  Like he's from Indiana, and he
1 basketball up there.  The Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd
0 they got rid of last year.  I'll think of them in a minute.  Perkins, Sam

0 B:  Well, he stays with me --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  -- it's coming in a couple of months, but [laughter]. 
1 B:  Well, that sounds like a pretty good project.
1 A:  you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest [laughter],
1 A:  Well, hopefully the bins will be here in this month and that will spur you
1 B:  Thinking about it, anyway [laughter].
1 A:  -- yeah, it's real little.
0 A:  -- we made a higher and a lower --
1 tall [laughter],
0 B:  Uh-huh.

1 B:  Ooh, that's a big dog.
0 was born, and she would totally ignore this baby, I mean the dog could be
1 A:  -- (( )) and then all of a sudden the dog decided she was okay, but,
0 own thing with all this, uh, what do you call it, uh, breaking up
1 B:  Right.
1 B:  I know it.
1 B:  Right.
1 B:  Yeah, really,
0 A:  Yeah, I think so --
1 B:  -- do we agree, or unless it's not me [laughter].
1 lot of pollution [laughter].
0 brown haze all the time --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yes, we are, and I think of my daughter and I'm sure you think of your
0 years ago, and of course there's no industry, very little trash, they --
1 the time, depending on my size [laughter].
1 B:  -- or you're on your way up from regular size [laughter] --
0 front --
1 to the hips, so it has to be not the straight up and down levis
0 A:  -- kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light
0 B:  -- and be comfortable --
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Yeah, so I would roll my windows down, it was still a hundred
0 was held accountable so much I had to document and create a paper chase for
0 B:  What child's going to say something --
0 B:  Yes, you wonder what their, you know, how they manage to do
0 B:  Oh, do you?
0 A:  -- to me that's the ideal situation --
0 A:  -- and, uh, I'm pretty picky about my criteria of child care,

0 there, but then --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 take any length of time over.

0 B:  I go there on business, and I really enjoy getting around and
1 and she said, she said, (( )) there's no trees down there.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let u-, let me [laughter].
1 and I said, You know, this is just a, I, I, I can just hear the dog crying for
1 me now [laughter].
0 A:  I'm wondering what, what camping means to you.
0 recently, but, um, up until, gee, maybe five or six years ago, I
0 summer we'd often go up, um, to the lake country in New York --
0 B:  [Cough].
1 B:  Oh, good grief.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 son is not eager to go and,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  I think it would be,
1 B:  Yes.
0 A:  Yes.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  That's right.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 talk,
0 of freons that do not release as many C F C -s into the atmosphere --
0 A:  -- so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price
0 A:  -- that, uh, those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 I first turn the T V on, I, I normally go to those, because I pay
0 A:  Yes [laughter].
0 nights, starting fairly late, like I'm talking ten o'clock and
1 B:  I don't believe I'm watching.
1 to, uh, that male syndrome of flicking that channel, so,
1 A:  -- [Laughter] you know, and I'm saying let's move right on
1 on Sunday.
0 flip around, I think the other night we had on, uh, uh, it was a,
1 absolutely sit glued to it, I, you know, 
0 Dakota --
0 B:  I didn't own a winter coat to wear to work until, um, two
1 B:  Oh God,
0 A:   What are your favorite places?  
0 A:   It's not the, the rinky Chinese decorations --
1 husband has just gotten stuck.  
0 because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church and Bob
1 A:   Yes, they are.  
1 A:   Exactly [laughter].  Exactly.   
0 remember his name.  Anyhow it's some,
0 radio commercials -- 
0 B:   Uh-huh, thank you.  
1 A:  because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.
1 enjoy it.  So if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.
1 A:  My daughter and, and I hate camping so we go shopping.  
0 years before it wasn't quite as much, so.
1 something against me would, uh, get shot.  But I'm an old country girl that,
1 produced you've got people like Jeff ((Dollmeyer)) that was [laughter],
1 that it would cover [laughter]. 
1 A:   Then when we actually got out of school and employed and
1 groceries.  And, and lots of times I go over that amount but
0 average. 
0 B:   [Laughter] For us ((it)) always seems to be Christmas time
1 want to pay fifty dollars off of my bills that I have, you know. 
0 three children and that seems to really help, and we probably don't
1 B:   [Laughter]. 
0 A:   Like, I just think that they were expected to be at home more
0 been, uh, in, I hate to use the word again accepted in the position
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:   Just, just because I don't see it.  I also, I work with a lot
0 @A: Okay.  Uh, what kind of music do you like?  
1 B:  Yeah, I had fun with it.  As, as long as it wasn't too dull and boring
0 everything.
1 A:  Oh, just sing it to me [laughter]. 
0 B:  So I just have to listen to the music and, you know, pick it out.
1 A:  Well, I've been real, um, [baby] thinking I'd love to buy a new car,
1 B:  I, right now my car is terminally ill --
0 and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for
0 B:  And if I can find one or a repossession.  
1 A:   Uh, they're all grown up.  
1 B:   Oh [laughter]. 
0 B:   Not quite.  It's a, when they start to crawl they try to climb
0 up on things and -- 
0 my choice for when, when I have children but, but some people don't
0 B:   What?  
1 on when I go to work, I don't think the news usually hits,
1 @@B:   So, what more do we need to discuss [laughter],
1 like the Bahamas and Florida.  I enjoy the beach.  
1 antibeach.  
1 come out of the sand, [laughter] and it tore the ligaments in my
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
1 I'm ma-, 
0 B:   Well, I, I love to go and play around.  At least I always did
0 summer [breathing].  Uh, I don't know we'll have to, to,  
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
1 someplace like that is, you know, gee, Holly would starve to death
0 A:   Yep.  
0 A:   -- you've just got to drive down [laughter] to the, to the
1 to that.
1 A:   Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the
1 B:   [Throat_clearing].  
0 after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put
0 you know, because he was really skittish.  But it was like he knew --
1 the dog would sleep on my side,
1 A:  And when everybody turned we all four of us [laughter] turned in a row
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 situation.  Um, from what I've been hearing is the U S, uh, S R has
1 right now [laughter]. 
0 good weekend.  
1 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:   Uh-huh.
1 A:   Yes [laughter].
0 that I wasn't really, you know, used to.  But, you know -- 
0 B:   And, uh, delightful to be outside.   
0 B:   I got in trouble when I was in the service quite a few years
0 A:   That's,
0 eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to
1 down right quick.  
1 B:   Oh, yeah.  
0 B:   You should still be [sniffing] [/baby_crying],
0 A:   Everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save
0 B:   -- it would -- 
0 A:   -- that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for
1 B:  Yes, yes.  
1 A:  Yeah, [laughter] and get around town [laughter]. 
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  We seem to do this every, [breathing] every weekend we've been out looking
1 B:  -- so I guess every, every month we don't buy we save more money than we
0 A:   Um, let's see.  
1 believe that we're still wearing shorts, 
0 A:   Okay.  
0 going --
0 B:   I bet it is.  
1 A:   Yeah, and thank God we don't operate our budget, 
1 government [laughter]. 
0 A:   Isn't, that's the way they're thinking these days anyway.  
0 scan through the headlines [laughter] and, 
0 B:   Yeah.  If there's something, you know, that I want to know
0 facts.  
1 B:   Yeah [laughter].  That's --
1 A:   Uh-huh.  My goodness [laughter]. 
0 A:   Well, that's a very interesting food though and when I go out
1 A:   Anyhow [laughter], 
1 B:   Oh, yes.  
0 A:   [Lipsmack] Yeah, yeah.  Wha-,
0 A:   That's I think, uh, I don't know in the short run it would be
0 B:   Yeah.  
1 know.  Gosh.  I think, you know, we should have got him while we
1 [laughter] could --
0 out.  
1 know.  But I just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds
0 B:   Under early bail, you know --
0 should be befitting the crime.  
0 shouldn't be in there.  
0 B:  And, and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not,
1 A:  Um, boy, and I can't remember now.  
1 A:  Yeah, and it's like, no, we're not provoking it.  No [laughter].
1 A:  that they used for that and, um,
0 response would be.  I'm a first generation American.  
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 A:  did labor.  But what do you think, are you from Texas or,
1 B:   I hate it [groan].
1 B:   [Sniffing]  But anyway,
0 A:   [Laughter]  I know.  We're not supposed to talk but,
1 B:   That's about all I would have to say about exercising anyway. 
0 A:  um, and you have to exercise, I think, for a long period of
1 need that too.  
0 B:   Oh, okay.  So,
0 the winter is over and --
1 B:   [Laughter].  
1 car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on
1 B:   Yes, one was bad enough.  But I think I got rid of the wrong
1 one [laughter]. 
0 and we can't get it resolved so we go to the jury and we're ask,
0 B:   Well, it, it would amount to, if you're, if you're rich, if
0 A:   [Lipsmack] Uh, there's little basis for comparison.  
1 =========================================================================
0 B:   Right.  
0 so, uh, I really don't have to dress up like y-, you would, like
1 change and we're going to have more Florida type weather up here
0 B:   -- especially when it gets pretty cold.  
0 B:   -- expect women to be in skirts [laughter] -- 
0 B:   Yeah [laughter].  That's right [laughter].  
1 A:   Uh, well, then you, you, you know why they make them then
0 B:  Just, just from a technical point of view, that interests me.  Not to kill
1 A:  This is an eas-, easy subject.  I, I guess I watch too much T V but
1 right now, so {pause} [breathing], I watch a lot of, lot of JEOPARDY and
0 my husband, so [laughter].  We've been MCGYVER fans forever.  I don't know if
1 B:  That's, getting tickets for something like that, it's like trying to, 
0 [laughter], when I was a, a teenager and growing up, that was
1 your,
1 is the Regency Hyatt.  
0 B:   -- air-conditioning was so p-, you know, prevalent --  
1 home and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner,
0 A:  Yes.  
0 unoccupied house to rob.
0 A:  Right, well, and sometimes that's, this is just the lead in to a sales
0 B:  How about you?  
0 B:  Where -- 
1 A:  Uh, and I use it all day at work and I put all my personal stuff on it at
0 B:  Oh, okay.   
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Well, I probably do because I've,    
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 ago now.  
0 from South Dakota to, uh, Plano, Texas and, uh, that was the thing
0 A:   And then finding someone that satisfies them.  
1 somebody, not so much to baby-sit the kids, but tutor them in
0 B:   Oh, see, and that would have been wonderful.  
0 B:   My wife always wanted to write something down and keep track,
1 B:   -- but we still haven't had a problem paying the rent
1 B:   -- and, yeah.  
0 A:   Yeah, they're all novels.

1 followed them too much and none of them are our, our alma mater
0 the, the N B A players playing on the Olympic team.  
1 A:   Oh [laughter]. 
1 A:   All right, that's an interesting assortment.  
1 B:   I'm not quite that bad.  
1 A:   Yeah, whittling or [laughter],  
1 few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed, but most
1 B:   And, uh, we kind of help out the people who are really not
1 B:   Uh, no, not quite because I'm not a whole family.  I'm just
0 A:   [Laughter].  
1 A:   Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea [laughter]. 
0 A:   Well, I, probably, probably.  
0 B:  Well, you know, it's [throat_clearing], it's funny, I mean, I, I know, I,
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 around other cats she'll pick a fight real fast.

1 A:   Oh, no, now I loved having a boat.  
0 B:   First best day is the day you get and the day you get rid of
0 B:   Did you go fishing?  
0 B:   Okay.  
0 B:   Yeah, especial-, we got two kids that are --  
1 A:   Uh, I kept a monthly budget for so long, I don't have one now
0 A:   Like doctor bills [laughter] and things like that.  
0 A:  Well, great.  
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  And at that point it was either performing or teaching.  It was, like, oh,
0 A:  I kind of wondered.

1 @B:   Well, it's kind of a broad subject, uh, I,  
0 A:   You all got a pay raise this year.

1 we named it Duchess and then we found out it was a boy.  
1 B:   Yes.  
1 lid and the momma rabbit, the white one had had eleven babies
1 A:   So that was quite a surprise and,  
1 A:   so we went from three bunnies to fifteen in a matter of two
0 B:  Oh, one thing that I look for is, uh, well, maybe not the most important
0 A:  Okay.  
0 A:  I work as a E D P auditor and, yeah, I've got a degree and a bunch of

0 B:  Okay.  
0 A:  [Laughter] I know.  
0 A:  Um.  
0 B:  Yeah, that's what happens because,

0 unlike, uh, like in, in Arab societies.  If you get, get caught stealing, they
0 [lipsmack] to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah, I sure did.  Of course, I'm a Kevin Costner fan [laughter].
0 B:  He does put in a real good, it's a real lighthearted movie.  If you are,

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 are, we are having to build new prisons because there is no place to put, to
0 B:  Right.

1 A:  But, still, Brennan's is so lovely and the service is so wonderful
1 B:  Oh, wow.  
1 like a brand new like Lamborghini [laughter].
1 B:  Something with a, that's not too sporty because of insurance, then
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Right, I mean, I wasn't a great asset to them or anything [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time [laughter].

1 A:  I've tried to do that with sugar and, 
1 A:  it's almost impossible --
0 B:  [Laughter] #I don't know if I'm that brave yet#.
1 A:  -- that's a problem, but.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  I understand there's, uh, what, several hundred, or even thousands of
0 have many, uh, many blacks to speak of.  You know, probably less than five
1 B:  No, me neither.
0 A:  -- nasty?
0 B:  Uh, Santa Anna.  It's near Anaheim.  Disneyland.
0 A:  #Yes, yes, that's supposed to be really# pretty.
0 A:  I've been through there.  Those trees are huge.  You can drive a car
0 Italian restaurant, and I know, [laughter] my sister-in-law was saying the
0 other day she knew of a little place down in, well it's about thirty miles
1 B:  I mean in a restaurant [laughter].
1 A:  Got you your McDonald's, your Pizza Inn, your Taco Bell, 
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  -- but it takes three or four months to get in shape.  So.
0 take over the pets.
0 lot and --
1 A:  Well cool.  When I was growing up we had a dog.  One dog and [laughter],
1 think we should go back and get it now or,
1 should probably wait.
1 I didn't like cats at all.
1 B:  She doesn't really care too much.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 paid, then that can't, it seems to me it can't possibly, you know, help with
0 administration could do.
1 like I, like I think, 
0 B:  it's hard, but I mean, a lot of times women were given jobs because they
0 B:  Yes, it does [laughter].  I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down
0 about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes, I
0 thing led to another, and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from
1 B:  #Kind of fun, isn't it.#
1 A:  That's what I needed, and I didn't think about that.  I got a Mickey Mouse
0 a, a range of care, I guess, so that --
0 A:  And they're all quite young --
1 B:  No, I'm in, I'm in graduate school right now [laughter].
0 B:  Okay.
1 B:  No.
1 university.
0 A:  And what the scholarship could not supply I was able to, to work for and --
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates.
0 B:  #The space# station's where we should go --
0 B:  #Now do# you have to have tickets ahead?  #Excuse me.#
0 A:  What restaurant is it?
1 B:  We couldn't see our pa-, we couldn't see our parking lot.
1 B:  Uh, a bug's a bug.
0 B:  -- but, uh, I mean, this was like every other day he was coming out there
1 B:  Maybe shut, shut down, shut down work, 
1 A:  Oh, well, I'm not from here, but, yeah, I never really did learn
1 [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Um, I agree, I think that our education system needs revamped, I,
0 we were given so much money in a voucher and we're able to choose which
0 A:  -- long vacation period.
0 it was built.  I get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and uh, twen-,
0 A:  Well, that's very interesting.  I've had, I've had exactly the same

0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Send, send them to Wisconsin, 
1 A:  Well, I don't think I could walk up sixty-eight flights of stairs
1 B:  That, that's the major reason I'm walking up the stairs.
1 the heavy stuff, and I do all the fun stuff [laughter].
0 B:  I see.
0 B:  Wild flowers.
1 don't have to worry about any of that [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers, and we planted those out by
1 B:  Oh really [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, I love home gro-, grown tomatos.  
0 A:  Um, the economy is, is doing badly, and Bush isn't looking good as a
1 result.
0 A:  I don't know how old you are.  I'm, I'm, I'm fifty, but I go back to where
0 B:  Yeah, there, I don't know, I mean, [laughter] there's just so many, there's
0 A:  Yeah.
0 or something, man you, the first thing you'd want to do is kill them.  I mean,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  -- um, in my position, I, well in addition to that the local political
1 the, 
1 B:  You want to talk about, 
0 and raci-, you know, you ask those same people --
0 B:  I, I, I worked on some of it at T I --
1 it'd be real nervous.
1 A:  -- as far as me seeing it, you know, 
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
1 A:  Some crazy hit man over there so, 
1 A:  -- crazy guys get a hold of it, you never know.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 still hasn't been taken of in fact.  We were driving along the other night,
0 B:  Oh. 
1 A:  -- to admit that when the weather starts to get cold, 
0 A:  And so I've, I've [throat_clearing] had them all, and, and, uh, uh, have
0 A:  Well, their daughter was on a weekend trip with the church and, and they
0 B:  I know we, we really liked Hot Springs just because we, neither of us had
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  Well, yeah.
1 vacant lot.
0 A:  Well, tell me about your home.
0 swing yet, so, I haven't been able to play as much as I would have liked to
1 B:  -- so you don't gain weight [laughter], 
1 B:  -- and so it's just kind of, 
0 part of your body.  I never realized, you know, I thought basketball basically
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  -- skiers but, 
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Well, no, not [laughter] really.
1 few times [laughter], 
0 A:  That's, you don't have to do as much as, as I thought.  In fact, my
0 B:  -- start all over --
1 A:  No, not really.  
1 my wife [laughter].
0 B:  Yes, I really enjoyed it.  I'd read the book, and I thought they stayed
0 until seven, and I'll just, uh, leave the office at five, go to a movie, and
0 we just all go to movies [laughter].
0 A:  And, uh, we're just offering a, a new card that gives you on-, up to one
0 B:  Well, I, I'll tell you, that works, because I use my Discover card more
0 A:  Yeah #yeah# --
0 him as long as they did.
0 A:  It was a, I guess they played last Friday here in Salt Lake, and about the
0 first two minutes of the game, Isaiah drove in and Malone went up to block the
0 A:  Anyway.
1 paper probably, or a sports page in [noise] I venture to say in about a month
0 think.#
1 A:  What do you think about that?  Do you think he got what he deserved, or
0 A:  Yeah.  I don't know how the Lakers are going to do without him this year.
0 heard of so many abuses, he just didn't want that.
0 so, so, uh, I've thought about this more than once, uh, you know, dealing with
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  We've got a lot of (( )), in federal court they have a uniform sentencing
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think it's curious that the sentences that are handed down
1 B:  Oh, it's quite, quite big, huh.
1 A:  You mentioned the word rough.  My idea of rough, 
0 gosh, they're already into this, uh, well, car camping plus,
0 expressed interest in going and doing some camping, so.
1 A:  -- and without thinking I picked up a stick and threw it at him --
1 A:  It turned around, and if a skunk can give you a dirty look, it did.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 years so mainly, 
0 B:  Yeah, and, and they're the same silly things, I mean, if you've read one, I
0 B:  Uh, have you, uh, gotten into SCARLETT yet?
1 B:  Well, it was around here last night, I'll tell you that [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Well, not really, 
1 it's, uh, in fact, I've, I've played golf on, on, uh, New Year's Day one year.
0 B:  How about yourself?
0 B:  Is it pretty rough?
1 to pay upkeep on it, or any [laughter],
1 it's a hole in the water that you throw money into.
1 B:  I've never heard that one.  I suppose that's probably true, so.
1 way to go, uh, nowhere fast,
0 B:  That might be the same sort of muscles that you'd use but,
1 don't know, the idea of having to commute,
0 A:  Oh, it's, uh, pretty warm.  It's about fifty-three degrees or so.  Uh, so
0 week.  So that was really quite a chore.
1 A:  -- the size of my yard is decreasing in proportion to my age.
0 B:  Well, see that's what, that's also on our wish list.  We, um, couple of
1 for [laughter] end up, 
0 B:  Yeah, that's true.  And, uh, let's see, what other benefits?  Do you have
0 A:  That's all they have.
0 B:  I see, uh-huh.
1 wouldn't go so far to say that we're trekkies but we, 
1 A:  I'm not, but my husband is, and he went last weekend to see it too
0 B:  Oh, at the movie house or,
0 B:  Have you seen DOC HOLLYWOOD?
0 B:  Oh, oh, good.  How about BEAUTY AND THE BEAST?  Have you, 
1 B:  -- just for yourself, 
1 A:  Our husbands both said, No way. 
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 then.
1 current movies I don't know what's going on but, 
1 the Challenger,
0 imagine that, uh, space flight is something that is going to really be within
1 A:  Yeah I well,
1 A:  Exactly, some of these boring ones, you just kind of babble on, I guess
0 B:  -- and, uh, we extended and, uh, started a club called the Altrusa Club of
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 church in my lifetime [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Haven't you?
1 know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch.
1 B:  Oh, I don't get into them that much.
1 B:  Well, 
1 B:  Yeah, well, they're not entertained for too long with it.  He's, 
0 B:  (( )).
1 A:  Ooh, that should be a lot of fun.
1 B:  And remember to yell Geronimo, 
0 B:  Uh, well, this is all, uh, it's all drywall --
0 B:  Yeah, could be, could be.  Although, they, a lot of those existed as states
0 B:  Well, it's interesting to talk about hobby, hobbies when you're so close
0 B:  -- and, has compartments in it, and they're, you know, they go pretty
0 type projects.
1 A:  -- I, I don't think I have a real talent for painting.
1 really cute, but they look hard to me [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, it comes out looking really nice.  
0 B:  So, they really are cute.  And, uh, she does them so quickly --
1 A:  My word.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 said, you'll probably have about fifty more orders from all the teachers
0 A:  Have you ever sewn the stuffed animal type things --
1 B:  -- quite frankly.
0 B:  I work because if I want to eat, I'm out there [laughter] working.
0 grateful that none of my daughters-in-laws at this time are working, because
1 B:  -- but the problem with these nursing homes is [throat_clearing] the cost
0 A:  We, we basically push her around, and she's lost control of her bowel, and
1 B:  Yeah, well hopefully, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 we simply go to an area, backpack in, spend a night or two, and then backpack
0 B:  Yes, I had my son with me, uh --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  -- and then in a week Mom and I agreed to chaperon my son's, 
0 A:  -- it'll still be there tomorrow.  
1 B:  And, um, so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school
0 B:  -- those kinds of things never happen --
1 A:  Yes, and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right?
1 A:  -- doing something.
1 A:  You're kind of like, what are you talking about and, uh,
1 A:  You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 on your toes, huh.
0 B:  -- after a short.
0 A:  Well.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Oh, my word.  And how old, you have a longevity, don't you, in your family
1 A:  Oh, oh, you're just a youngster then [laughter].
0 crime, whether a burglary or,
0 part about it, nobody seems to want to suggest the idea that doing without is
1 A:  All right [laughter].
0 as well as just, the general type of education that the school gives.
1 A:  You learn to appreciate what you had [laughter].
0 A:  What other points did you guys look at when you were trying to find her
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- oh, my gosh.
1 A:  Oh, cool.
1 A:  Meow, meow cats.
0 litters, and I'm glad the children experienced the process.  Uh, I didn't see
0 for feline leukemia, but back when this cat died, which was, oh, some ten
0 B:  So, we enjoy dogs because, uh, they kind of bark when someone shouldn't be
1 watch cats or anything, but I tell you what, we don't have any mice or, 
1 A:  -- and they'll leave us a present on the back or front step,
1 cat a big rabbit, and the fact of it, the cat and the rabbit looked pretty
1 B:  -- but I just, I was wiped out there for, 
0 B:  But, that was the way to do stuff, and, uh, I think you have to make the
0 good, but I know a lot of people do it.
1 B:  Well, it's uh, the interest rates are still crazy up there, you know, 
0 B:  So, it's not, uh, it's not really an advantage to have them, now they, uh,
0 something out of them now.
0 not going to use it, for example, like you said, with a Visa card really you
0 A:  -- I think a lot of times, especially, like I'm a student, so I don't have
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 B:  -- and using up all my nighttimes,
1 B:  You have one that often.
1 B:  Because about the best I can normally hope for is about fifty --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Well, I, I work the same way [laughter].

0 of chair?
0 configured.
1 yet.  So it's,

0 B:  Oh.
1 like,
1 B:  Oh, yeah, me too, uh, me too.  Unless I'm going somewhere warm

0 panicky [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, yes.  You know, I don't know how people, we-, it's pretty cold here in
0 A:  -- and I, I just think it would be so hard to have to get a child up, a

1 A:  Uh-huh, we kept trying [laughter].
1 telephone right now #[laughter].#

0 B:  They really are.  I've, I've enjoyed it.  I've never actually done any, uh,
1 that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe
1 B:  I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now [laughter].
0 B:  And then we went up the, the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San
0 A:  Okay. 
1 B:  -- I'm going to have to look at Lakers this year a lot.  
1 B:  -- I'll get used to it [laughter].  I learned a lot about football, so far,
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  
1 B:  So that was pretty fun to see the improvement.  
0 B:  -- got to do it indoors.  
1 B:  -- exactly what went wrong, you know [laughter].  
1 A:  Uh, well, uh, the Cowboys are my favorite team.  That's pretty easy to say
1 nowadays [laughter].
1 mister nice guys like they used to be.
1 A:  I'm watching them on T V right now.  But they're doing some stomping on
0 A:  -- they're winning.  
0 B:  Which is made by Toyota.  
0 about a half a dozen, uh, things and --
0 B:  -- #and you turn that on,# and it, yeah, and it kind of, uh, but that's
0 Year award all at the same time, I think.  But, uh, but in eighty-two I think
0 outfield there for the most part and, uh, quite a few of the infielders are,
0 have the radio going and listen to the news there and then, uh, I watch the
0 A:  They are, right.  
1 too.  #I think,#
1 B:  -- and Yeltsin is already there sitting there [laughter].  
1 B:  Hundreds.  
1 B:  So I feel sorry for all the liberals in town.  They have to,
0 S should move toward some kind of national health care plan.  At least as a
1 to, uh, and not have a completely socialized,
1 B:  I'm opinionated.  
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#

1 B:  Yes, we're not too long distance today.  
1 A:  All right.  
1 B:  Learned about their basketball team [laughter].  
0 A:  Oh. 
0 someplace.
0 already mentioned is, is health insurance.  I think through our health
1 B:  Then I think it makes a big difference.  
0 B:  Right.   
1 B:  retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so
0 B:  Wal-Mart?  
0 B:  Uh, he was just a wacko.  
0 B:  That's what it was.  He went around,
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 went to one, it was at my, uh, actually it was in Layton and it was at my
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 A:  Kind of a heavy topic tonight right,  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 know if they have it today.  I had a friend, though, in the seventies join,
0 B:  Uh, I just don't think they even, I don't know if they have those programs
1 throw up their arms about it and go, I'm going to Harvard and I, you know,
0 B:  Uh, so that was beneficial to me as well as the child, because, uh, made me
1 of necessity.  Just repairing things around the house.

1 B:  -- that was a joke, it was a joke [laughter].  
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  That you're in the bar and somebody has a gun next to you.  
1 A:  So, uh, what do you think about child care [laughter].  
0 B:  Wrapping her arm all the way around.  
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  
0 A:  No.  
0 We lost so many people due to crime this past year.  So what do you think is a
1 A:  Well, I mean, i-, when you live in Texas, you accept it when it comes.
1 interest and, uh, and your, your expertise.
0 B:  Yeah, why don't you, why don't we, why don't you do about thirty seconds
0 A:  Wow.  
0 B:  -- but, expert, no [laughter].  
1 you bet, boss, seeing as he was the one that, uh,
0 it, as it turned out one of the top, uh, people, or one of the top doctors in

0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  
0 A:  Uh-huh {faint}.

0 A:  Yeah.  So you do that even in January, huh?  
0 A:  -- North Carolina,
1 B:  Hundred [laughter], when you have a hundred here, everybody's dying
0 different stories [laughter].
0 want, want to go into it deeper.  You, uh, you --
0 A:  And then on the radio, you know, they usually, uh, give the news every
1 out of it [laughter].  I don't know what's going on and I don't really care
1 [laughter].
1 A:  You know so, 
1 B:  So we don't watch C N N [laughter].  
0 A:  Yeah, well [laughter], we were glad when it came, but it just keeps going
1 B:  Oh, is that right?  
1 A:  [Laughter].

1 B:  And I don't think that they, uh, do a very good job of distributing them to

0 A:  What are they doing out there?
1 around Boston eat a lot of yogurt so,
0 guess that one was, didn't work very well, uh, uh, but,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, uh, I guess, I guess nothing else, but, uh,
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  -- the, the, uh, break-up of -- 
0 A:  -- than they are now, like you're saying, the drugs -- 
1 thing, the very first thing a lawyer attempts to do is get an ignorant jury
0 really, [throat_clearing] it's, it's kind of a show piece any-, [laughter]
0 A:  -- but I'm on an internship up here for a year and then I go back down,
0 A:  You know, and also, the whole, whole thing with noise.  My mother, oh, she
0 deliberations.  Some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only

1 disposable, dis-, yeah, discretionary income,
0 very well.  It's, uh, it's helped us, so that we haven't been, you know, too
1 A:  -- and there's no surprises in that [laughter].  
1 A:  That's true, that's true.  I found that out.  
1 B:  The kids, they are real people and they are interesting and,
0 A:  Well, we had ((ni-, wh-,)) growing up I guess I can talk about us.  We had
1 B:  #I never# felt spoiled.
1 A:  Right.
1 B:  Well, ((so, so)). 
0 where I would have said, no, that no one would deserve to die for, for a crime
0 hanging by the necks --
1 you know you should make frequent checks and, um, to check in on them when
0 to see how many teachers you have.
0 B:  Right.  
0 directly from high school into, into college?
1 B:  Well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's,
0 A:  And that they get paid.
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
0 account, okay?
0 A:  I-, that is, uh, that is something I've heard.  Uh, I had a friend, uh,
1 vacation or, you know, sick days or health care or anything really so.
0 A:  Huh.  
1 B:  [Laughter]  That's a whole other topic -- 
0 B:  Now that's a big win.  
0 different #(( )).#
1 B:  #and# [breathing] that can be part of continuing education, maybe for
0 A:  As opposed to the corporat-, insurance paying the bills, 
0 A:  #(( )).#  
0 computer and have it check the arithmetic.
1 B:  Right.
1 A:  [Laughter] With the desperate fear that by the time they are old,
1 substantial other commitments to take care of,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 also have a, a, uh, company stock purchase plan which I contribute to.  And
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
0 worked out a very extensive year long budget --
1 A:  #really keeping# track of the pennies and that stuff.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 stuff but he said, well, you just do this and you fight once and, and,
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 that, um, the agency that, uh, that license, um, agencies to care for kids
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Right.  
1 B:  Yeah.  See I work for a really small company.  It's just me and my boss
1 A:  Oh, wow.
0 A:  So.  Uh, um, the only other thing I can think of is, uh, stuff for things
1 moved us from Dallas to San Antonio and then back to Dallas.
0 B:  So, but I guess it was pretty nice because, you know, we got to experience
1 million draft cards to start a war #[laughter] you know [laughter]# --
0 pro-, there are places we've been over the years that perhaps we shouldn't
0 think we've screwed up a few times just like everybody else.
1 B:  Okay.  Well, I mean, it's before my time too.
0 A:  Huh.  Yeah.  My only concern about projects like that, you know, (( )).  My
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And then otherwise, there will be [throat_clearing], the majority are
1 homes and, I don't know, you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor
0 A:  Okay.  Ann Richards is our governor in Texas and she's really cracking
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 My in-, families was up in Maryland --
0 B:  And, you know, the nursing home was the, you know, best facility to put her
0 needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people.  And then, the
0 A:  ((Well)) it's, uh, I'll start off here.  Uh, I don't know.  I get,
1 T V #scene here in the,#
0 about the, uh, either the economics or, or other wor-, news events going on in
0 the U S on the other hand.  And if you go up to, uh, Canada, [noise] those
0 A:  #[Laughter].#
0 B:  Uh, I like classical music.  I like rock and roll.
0 B:  Not the, not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that.
1 B:  #Oh, I# see.  Are you married at all?
0 B:  #Oh, rea-,#  Were they religious?
0 B:  And he's always liked it and, and, you know, he's probably about
0 her.  She's not rock but --
0 headline news or C N N itself and, uh --
0 you've ever seen it.  But it's a, it's a cable, well you don't have cable.
0 the news for the incredible stupid or comatose.
0 A:  -- like on education and stuff.  
0 B:  Yeah, I was thinking,
0 A:  Uh,
0 A:  Uh, I work for a fairly large company.  It's got eight thousand people.
0 A:  Yeah {faint}, well, it depends on which company you work for.  I know that,
1 just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and
1 A:  Yeah, but they, no, no longer [laughter].  
1 A:  I don't think so.  
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Well, growing up, I was always, uh, fairly athletic and always, uh, you
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 B:  -- right after work or,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 don't want to turn around and go back out again [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 these miles and I didn't need them but I, I changed the front, I had the
0 B:  Uh, you know, I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh, you know, to, going to college, university is going to take four to
1 ===========================================================================
0 know, thing to you, but, I think there should be some kind of curbside
0 B:  That's the only way I could really,
1 something --
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  If I, if see a, s-, if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something --
1 B:  -- I've never seen you before [laughter].  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Can bring them in.  
1 B:  The hostile planet, I think,
1 A:  It really is a small,
1 uh,
1 B:  Kind of radical, I know but,
1 B:  Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V -s on their wrist,
0 worked here for a couple years and then he went to Ghana in --
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 thing to, to be --
0 B:  Yeah, it, we're essentially the same, although, some, some laboratories are
0 A:  Yes.  
0 like that?
1 I forced to watch quite a bit of sports.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah, we have to, fight over the remote control.  
0 few years ago and what we did was, uh, [breathing] since we didn't, weren't
0 A:  Yes, you know, trying to see who knew where who [laughter] else lived and
1 okay, we like him.
1 threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off.
0 B:  How much does he weigh now?  
0 B:  And [throat_clearing] he's our spoiled child right now, too [laughter].
0 B:  No, what is that?  
0 B:  -- it, it, it's the type of thing of what exactly am I getting out of the
1 if it's actually there when we actually,
1 eighteen percent of what I was spending every year,
0 A:  I don't think anybody pays too little.  
0 A:  ((We've)) got a five percent sales tax.  
0 B:  No, I, uh, I really think that, here in Indiana at least we pay a, a whole,
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 that a lot of the, the H E W services, although they're providing necessary
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 cut.
1 A:  Right.  
0 B:  And that could ruin somebody's life.  
1 almost, jeez, man, maybe twenty years, 
1 B:  almost since I last had any of that, that sort of stuff, uh,
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  
1 A:  That's good. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 other, uh, dogs that I have encountered.
1 B:  Well,  
0 B:  -- the poor animal is doing it in self protection.  
1 B:  Huh, well, I suppose you were surprised.  
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 --
0 because somebody has a child or, uh, likes children doesn't really mean that
0 and I didn't want to run an institution where that was the case, where all we
1 B:  That would be okay [laughter].  
1 listen to,
1 music to annoy you,
0 have, uh, not a lot of point to it.  I was really tired of, uh, the Michael
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  
1 test of time.
1 philharmonic,
1 isn't he still alive.  You know, we're, we're,
0 B:  [Throat_clearing] Okay.  
1 B:  Right.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  I'd like to do some sailing.  
0 A:  -- which is fine.  
0 A:  Great.  Yeah, how do you like it down there in Texas?  
1 [laughter].
0 there?  W-, w-, where did you say you were from?
0 A:  What's that?  
0 out in circulation.
1 that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison.
1 didn't see the classroom, uh, and, [laughter] hopefully never will, but, uh,
1 safe, so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison.
1 a liberal but,
1 we normally have to round up another child to keep him [laughter] occupied.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Your, your wife doesn't like that wilderness camping, does she?
1 B:  My wife thinks Holiday Inn's wilderness camping.  
0 B:  So, I don't know, do you all, do you fish and go camping, you take a boat
0 and, and just fish off the shore.
1 A:  [Laughter] .
1 hooks in your ears and stuff like that.
1 B:  Casting, that's all my boy cares about.  
0 A:  [Talking].
1 and one morning we got up, there's snow on the ground.
0 a little narrow road --
1 their tent up.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 price performance and #things like that.#
1 sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it and
0 happy with the, the set up.
1 B:  So how serious is the,
1 interests, I guess.
0 cases in which there's no smoking gun.  But, there, too, there are also cases
0 but in civil cases, I think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient.
0 A:  Well, I mean, I think, are you just trying to say that criminal cases are
1 B:  Well, in that case,
0 B:  -- this is the way things are and it,
1 B:  Just because that's what everybody says I should get when I get a car,
1 them.
0 B:  Well, you're single and,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  -- I've got this poor pitiful Pontiac and thing breaks down every other day
1 [laughter] so,
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 budget or not [laughter]?
1 B:  Then you don't have a budget.  
1 B:  -- you know,
0 that be an, an alternative.  I'm, I'm not too sold on the mini van idea.
0 A:  So they have a bulletin out on it?  
1 spending the taxes.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Worried that they're not going to get enough attention?
0 B:  Yeah, and you, and you don't always even know if it's, it's going to be the
1 [laughter] or the phone rang or,
1 people who show up positive on one drug test, they're immediately discharged.
1 B:  [Sneezing] Ou-, ou-, our judicial system is in such total chaos.
1 B:  [Throat_clearing] You know, that's a, I've nailed the problem down but I,
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 Atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical, yet, you go out on the
1 that's paying for that [laughter].
1 [laughter].
1 system, you have to get the lawyers out of it [laughter].
0 B:  I once,
0 bottles, plastic milk bottles, then they'll pick that up for free so there's
0 B:  The rec-, we live in Plano and they started off recycling by, uh, putting
1 B:  Or even bottles.  
1 B:  Right.  
1 B:  It's, I don't know, it, it can be, it's not as easy [laughter],
1 you put them in the dishwasher.
1 B:  We all do it [laughter].  
0 on their, their, you know, territory and everything, but --
1 a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first.  Particularly,
0 like [laughter], uh, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve
0 B:  Yeah, it's really, it's really bizarre.  Uh, particularly, like where we
1 circumstances.  I guess it's an eye for an eye [breathing].
0 care to make sure they've got the, uh, the right person --
0 A:  -- just totally inappropriate.  
0 B:  You mean, do we have -- 
0 logistically, we just haven't been able to get our act together well enough to,
1 B:  Well, that's, I think you can take that nice simple, nice simple
1 B:  So, what are they doing down in, uh, Georgia?  
1 that we need more or anything like that.
1 eventually, uh, like Klaus Von Bulow
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 financials at first and, uh, that's part of the reason he became a nominee is
1 B:  Oh, plenty.  Way, way more than I can stand down here.  
0 everywhere, as I see it.  Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses so,
1 those guys were.
1 B:  I mean not, inhuman.  
0 A:  And they've done that every seas-, every year for a while [laughter].
1 B:  Oh [laughter].  
0 to get into the habit of just having that time reserved but,
0 =========================================================================
0 B:  -- then at the same time, raping them all, so, so that's kind of like a
1 and, uh, the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break
0 case, I was surprised, uh, so happened this person worked at the same place, I
0 B:  Uh-huh.  So you think that, uh, majority, majority rule is good enough for,
0 professional judges, uh, you know, know the ins and outs of the system better.
0 sentence a, uh, a criminal to, for a certain amount of years that we don't
0 really know what that means.
1 B:  -- uh, but, I guess, uh, that would take a major constitutional change here
0 B:  Well, in terms of, of immediate expenses like clothing, uh, I purchase
0 A:  Liberty Mutual?  
1 and we spent so much time trying to, to make sure that the boys are okay
0 Buying a car is, uh, something you're contemplating, I take it.
1 it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive, I probably ought to be home
1 been guys in jail for six years and the other guy admits that he did it and
0 A:  Well, yeah, I mean, the system isn't perfect, I mean, it's run by a bunch
0 about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it.  [inhaling] And, uh,
0 B:  you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape -- 
0 B:  And I don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective.  
0 A:  Right, uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- then I think they should be eliminated from -- 
0 A:  [Laughter] Right.  
1 B:  -- and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one,
1 A:  Yeah, they're thick.  
0 B:  [Throat_clearing].
1 [laughter] who fall into that,
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Okay [laughter].  So, yes, I think we do have problems with taxes
0 money --
0 Press Club, and he was talking about how people in the government say, well,
1 A:  Well, I'm a student, that's why I was asking.  
0 expensive I thought.
0 A:  And there's not much of a selection, at least in my price range, like
0 A:  -- you know, they really don't have much of a chance --
0 you?
0 as a matter of fact.  They were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade.
1 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.  
0 B:  And the hardware, well, I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are
0 B:  (( )) base.
1 be due west of them and we get a fallout cloud.
0 same position again.
0 want to attack the United States.
0 not looking to us for, you know, uh, invasion at this point [noise].
0 A:  Uh-huh {very faint}.
0 B:  So in the process of seizing, the belt spun on the pulley and wore --
0 set up.
1 A:  Yeah, I did that for about a year and had my fill of that.
0 B:  [Inhaling] Right.  Right.
0 B:  I know that's the case in my office at least.
1 B:  [Laughter] Oh, wow.  When you said you were going to school full time
1 or something like that,
0 circumstances, you know, I guess which would be while the car was running and
0 B:  #No.#  Not like she will later on.
0 A:  #Yeah when,# 
0 B:  -- all of a sudden you're paying, you're trying to decide whether you are
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Most and ten being no restrictions at all.
1 [smack] assault rifles, you know, that's, that's, uh, made [laughter],
0 B:  Yeah.  So,
1 A:  -- you did, it really wouldn't be worth eating, so [laughter].
0 [laughter] history of, uh, of violent crimes or something then you certainly
1 don't need a hand gun.
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Yeah.  No time.
0 job it is.  If it's a job that's, uh, dealing with say, uh, like a pharmacy job
0 some about Saturns.  I don't know [inhaling] a lot about them.  I haven't been
0 A:  Yeah [clicking].
0 B:  Uh, as rental cars.  And I've always been very impressed [swallowing] with
0 lived with us when I was a little girl for about three or four years.
1 felt really bad for putting her there [laughter] and stuff.
0 ===========================================================================
0 as, uh, highways being, uh, you know, people would dr-, have a drink of soda,
0 B:  I had a friend taking care of him and that doesn't work.  
0 B:  I mean it's a continual rotation of resources.
0 A:  Oh, does she?
1 A:  Um.  It depends.  Uh, it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten
0 B:  So there's maybe a five year gap between us.
0 B:  -- #a house# in the suburbs or,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities.
0 then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put.  Uh, because
0 it directly on the school.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah.
1 interesting game to watch.  That and rugby.  I've like to watch,
0 B:  #[Laughter] Yeah.# That's just wild.  That's why it's a go-, a big college
1 fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do
1 year.  So you,
1 A:  Well, you know, I [laughter].
0 B:  Is he able to, uh, still do everything himself pretty well?
0 A:  Well, he was until this operation.  He has arthritis.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  And so, the money I have left over is pretty much put into investments.
1 A:  -- or it goes, uh, goes into the bills, you know.  One or the other
0 A:  Right.  Oh, i-, it is a budget.  I mean, I certainly #consider# --
1 A:  #So, I've# actually, probably making less money than I was when I started
0 B:  Well, that, that's true of all of us #[laughter].#
0 #time.#
1 since we play before work.
1 extent of my exercise [laughter].  It's kind of crazy.
1 A:  -- get pretty strenuous #[laughter] doing that sort of stuff.#
0 A:  Yeah.  I, I did some of that but it, the time it takes is just [laughter].
0 the system is --
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 on the F one fifties, especially like in the, in the four wheel drive models
1 B:  Yeah, I've got one little girl and, and, and a set of golf clubs, so
0 A:  -- unless you're s-, like some kind of contortionist.  
0 B:  Yeah, uh-huh.  
1 know, this r-, Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde,
0 B:  What, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though?  I
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Well, I'm, #I'm saving.#

0 B:  Especially around children.  But he's really good.  I can't complain.

0 talking about real trauma.  I mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of

0 there.
0 B:  #Really?#
1 talk to you about that #afterward, okay.#
0 oppressed region [rustling].
1 A:  I think that'd be an interesting experience.  But, uh, I haven't done that
0 A:  [Throat_clearing].  
0 B:  Yeah.  I've, I've heard some, I mean I've heard sta-, sta-, statistics and
0 themselves, they will, they will learn well.  For example, if you t-, deal
0 pay our teachers so little.
0 B:  And with, you know, with a virtually nonexistent budget they have to supply
0 A:  #Yeah.  That's true.#
0 A:  Well, I work at N C State University and I do the same thing.  I spend, I
0 teachers have to deal with.  And (( )), and by the way, that's another reason
0 growth, population growth around here [inhaling].  And, uh, [sigh] it's, uh,
0 certain age, like over twenty years old, you didn't have to get it done
1 A:  [noise] Huh.
1 and lunch.
0 she's like no I don't want her to starve.  But I don't want to make her eat
0 B:  #And just# have like t-, at the most, like ten kids.  And all from maybe
0 half of them she'd like to turn them into the state [laughter].  And that's
0 the people that are working there, you know.  And then she would like to turn
1 @B:  Uh, it, it varies.  I-, it's totally dependent upon what mood I'm in.  
0 A:  do you go to any concerts?
0 have a very stressful day at work and then I'll get home and let's, uh, pick,
1 su-, sang a couple of the songs and we've got a few thousand people singing

1 A:  So, anyway, those, #that, uh,# 
1 it was,# 
1 #The ones that are wanting,#
0 A:  -- for that period of time [swallowing].  And, uh, you know, it's, uh, how
1 any house.

0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  So, you know, he's like spinning around in this stuff, #you know.#
1 [laughter] and stop trying to help me #[laughter].#
0 nights, uh, the, we have a rule now that, that, uh, cause the kids are so

0 A:  #Really?#
0 A:  -- uh, I'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up

1 yo-, you know, the same philosophy of raising children [laughter] that you did

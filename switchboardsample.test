0 B.22: And I think, uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these. So I'm ul-, I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point,
0 A.39: Oh, I don't know, is it, - do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue? 
0 A.45: I don't know, sometimes I feel, - I mean I do go to church and things. I don't know how I would feel about it. But like you say, if it hit you personally,
0 B.94: Yes. 
0 B.92: It's my experience and, and my knowledge that, that is beneficial, but then, you know, like I said, I came in backwards. 
0 B.59: And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off. 
0 A.82: This is a sweet. Oh it is, it's a candy, I'm like ugh, you know, Indian candy is not very good. 
0 A.90: Good, they didn't have, - I didn't like her desserts very well, they were very, yogurt and carrots and pin-, pistachios, pistachio nuts and yogurt. 
0 A.94: Uh-huh. 
0 A.122: Hey thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later. 
0 B.123: All right, thank you, bye-bye. 
0 B.8: <Laughter> Yeah, I, I, I, I feel that way when movies are like blown up, out of proportion, you know -- 
0 B.84: -- yeah, he's, anyway, and that was just excessively violent. I was worried -- 
0 A.109: But - yeah, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was sort of the same way, they, I guess they figured, I mean, they know what they're doing, and they make the movies good enough, I guess I'm a bit of a snob, they make the movies good enough to be successful -- 
0 B.112: Uh-huh. 
0 A.67: Yeah, 
0 B.64: No, it's just the, like the bees and insects will do it. 
0 B.80: Sure. 
0 B.124: Um. 
0 B.27: And the U S has. You know, it's like they, it seems like they can, their, their army or whatever can, can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do, do the job with, uh, you know, less suffering. 
0 A.11: You know, I, +
0 B.52: Uh-huh. 
0 A.65: Uh-huh. 
0 A.101: Uh-huh. 
0 B.106: Uh-huh. 
0 A.109: -- and their inability to understand, um, multicultural or multiracial situation -- 
0 A.133: some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the are the overseas programs. Uh, 
0 B.40: Oh, definitely. 
0 A.79: Oh, my. 
0 B.128: <Laughter> Just attention, you know. 
0 A.155: And different circumstances call for different things. 
0 B.31: Yeah. The, uh, the thing that's kind of interesting about this, - my sons in the Air Force. 
0 B.53: of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place, you know -- 
0 B.68: taken up by the, - oh, okay, o-, so, you know, well, that's, - I had wondered sometimes, I knew that there was a lot of, a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that, and I just wondered if, if it lasted, and if it took, you know, like,
0 A.7: And, uh, transportation expenses, I guess you own a car. 
0 A.21: Wow, must be nice. 
0 B.46: It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go. Uh, here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up. 
0 A.109: Well, even, the, you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet. 
0 A.49: Well. Do you work for T I? <noise> 
0 B.60: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it does. <sniffing> So, you only have the, you only have the stepdaughter at home? 
0 B.64: <laughter>.
0 B.128: Huh? 
0 B.196: It's, uh, I heard it's twenty bucks a whack. For adults. 
0 B.30: now our local stores don't, don't offer any guarantee. 
0 B.62: But at least, because I back up to, um, a hillside where the, uh, wild animals are, I think I can probably justify it. 
0 B.114: Right. 
0 B.138: Oh. 
0 B.34: Um, as far as the new hires, I, I hired on just early enough that I, I missed it. Um, where the new hires were concerned but, uh, not, nobody, no, I don't think anybody questions that, um, testing someone as a, as a precondition to being hired but, um, for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job that's, I, I don't know, that, that's where I think that most people get upset. It's, uh, you know, it, it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and, uh,
0 B.66: Uh-huh. 
0 A.69: Yeah. 
0 A.83: Uh-huh. 
0 B.14: And there's a lot of housing, 
0 A.15: Yeah. 
0 B.78: <Laughter> I guess so. We tend to use just bait.
0 A.155: Uh, and Colorado is a beautiful place to live. 
0 A.86: Uh-huh. 
0 A.41: Uh-huh. 
0 A.49: Yeah. 
0 A.83: So, uh, as, when they were growing up, I, probably we had a lot of similar things l-, like you had, you know, having the time. When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones. 
0 B.110: a parent, and that kind of thing, because,
0 B.190: had, -
0 A.4: Oh, at least once a week. We're, we're retired now. When we working out we ate out more than that <laughter>. 
0 A.118: Uh-huh. 
0 B.127: <Laughter> So you do eat out a lot. 
0 A.38: Yeah, yeah. 
0 B.45: Yes. 
0 A.50: -- some part of whatever they're accused of. 
0 A.82: And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to, because I bet, they still say our system is the best in the world. 
0 A.7: -- had a hard time getting a few folks, uh, I thought, well every, all these T I -ers have gone home, uh,
0 B.50: So we had to have, uh, - that's, uh, that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it. 
0 A.55: Well, you like Fords, apparently, huh? 
0 A.89: I like a V-eight. And I'm, I'm, ]
0 B.142: -- job for me. It was about a week before I finally --
0 A.165: But I broke one on my, on my Buick. And I always remembered it was my own fault, and I thought, well I'm going to t-, going to carefully take those hoses off. 
0 B.32: exploration. 
0 B.114: Well, doesn't it work, you don't see, uh, uh, anything until you spend the minimum? 
0 B.124: I pay a straight five dollars for anything, a doctor visit or drugs <breathing>. 
0 B.126: Oh, that one I haven't heard about. 
0 A.15: There's always that chance, I don't know, but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know, -
0 B.48: So, of course, the, the attorneys,
0 B.76: Reduce the violence in the prisons. I think that's its only purpose --
0 B.102: Oh, my word. 
0 B.106: Uh-huh. 
0 A.113: But, you know, I'd like to make sure that I have a job tomorrow first. 
0 A.1: Okay. Um, I don't have any, I guess, definite views about elderly care. Um, the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see,
0 A.41: Right. 
0 B.160: And, um, he's blind and he has seizures, you know, 
0 A.195: And, you know, I could just imagine, you know, working in a home like that, 
0 B.214: and they, um, have gotten comfortable being around these people,
0 A.233: with the younger children. They'll be telling them all kinds of stories.
0 A.6: exercise area, is covered in boxes. 
0 A.26: <Laughter>.
0 A.68: CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE. 
0 A.74: Yeah. There is, there is a lot of good information out there, uh, about health. And a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true. 
0 B.58: <breathing>
0 A.187: Uh huh. 
0 B.56: So, you know, our school system down here is no where near perfect but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it. 
0 A.23: Uh-huh. 
0 A.39: That's great. 
0 A.59: Uh-huh. 
0 B.60: uh, extraordinary things on T V,
0 B.152: in and around Dallas, 
0 B.172: And that, that's why I think if people were more exposed to, uh, -
0 B.198: That's right. 
1 A.57: Yeah, you've got about another six months and then you'll get one <laughter>. 
0 A.141: Was it? 
0 B.198: Huh-uh. 
0 B.264: It's pretty bad.

0 B:  But, I'm not in that professional of a position, so,
0 secretaries, and clerks and things, are they also,
0 B:  Yes, pretty much,

0 A:  Just about.  Yeah.  
0 B:  Well, uh, they used to do it down in Florida.  Now, I lived down there for
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 you know, one oh five.

0 A:  Yeah.  A friend of mine had a, uh, had a Buick, had, had a diesel in it and
0 been Buick, I think, because I think it was G M that came out with a dis-, or

0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Right, right, accessories, uh-huh.

0 B:  Okay, it was nice talking to you, also. 
0 B:  Oh, gosh, yes, uh, oh, Yellowstone about four years ago, four or five years
0 A:  When I go camping, I don't, I don't like to rough it.  I like to have a
0 National Parks and stuff [sniffing].  We camped at the, let's see, we camped
1 shore and they were, and the, and the smell of, that was kind of gross but
0 B:  Uh-huh, oh yeah.
0 the sand was all blowing up, and you couldn't even go out of the camper, the
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  when I was, when we were camping so extensively, when we were younger.
0 A:  My fianc3ee and I, one day, would like to own a big motor home.  Mainly
0 B:  Yeah.  and go to wherever the football game is, and have someplace to sleep
0 A:  and, park it outside of the stadium, and have a good old time.
0 B:  So, it, it's a, it can be really handy to have a camper.  Just cause, my,
0 B:  Yeah.  Well [sigh], what else?  [laughter] Well, I think that's just pretty
0 A:  I think it was the black hills of South Dakota.
0 A:  Well, I lived in Omaha for five,
0 B:  Terrain.
0 A:  Yeah.  Is, is ((fairly famili-,)).  The thing that I thought was
0 A:  Uh, and I had been told, you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three
0 A:  kind of,
0 did look at my watch after about an hour.
0 A:  Is, uh, do you know who he is?
0 twelve years old, and they call in and they review movies.  But it's, uh --
0 it.  You know, he, he enjoyed the story line and I think he just really w-, he
0 and yeah, it was him, but with a --
0 A:  -- you know, with the beard and all that stuff.  I mean, it's, uh,
1 A:  Yeah.  Real scruffy looking,
0 B:  You think so?  I mean, I haven't been watching my watch. Um, [static] I
0 finds something out about you that's another.  And the first kind of invasion
0 reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message and then I realize,
0 B:  so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that
0 B:  Commercial,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
1 and I can't talk about the second one other than to, to, to generate paranoia
0 B:  I don't,
0 sure why.  Uh, I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts and if someone
0 A:  Yes, yes, ev-, more harmed or something.
0 B:  you don't have anyway to turn it off.  Tho-, did you hear about this
0 would find that there be, cou-, a good possibly that their facts were, were
0 to generate incorrect things, that's even worse so,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 said they would give it out to only select companies but, um, you know, just
1 B:  Right.  Right.
0 check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering, you know, full cash
0 price,
0 to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having virtually
0 anyone, any hacker being able to know what your income is, what your spending
0 touch with the sneak thief and suddenly and then what started as an invasion
0 least officially.
0 tend to knock, you just, if there's a door closed and you open it because it's
0 A:  You know, it very much is.  But on the other hand, I realized I could go
0 out on the street and act like a complete lunatic,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in the
0 mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 it's obvious, you know, the results of sex are quite obvious, [laughter], as
0 just don't quite, um, there's hope, I actually for al-, of the time I've spent
0 have a sense of privacy.
0 A:  Arch, how are you doing tonight? 
0 B:  Good.  And yourself? 
0 A:  Where are you? 
0 B:  That's a hard issue to decide, um, on the one hand, you don't want to have
0 on the ballot that they wanted to, uh, rollback the taxes on everybody's
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 are going to be charging tuition, just like colleges are.  Uh, and it will
0 B:  Yes. 
0 issue.  No one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand, you got to do
0 B:  I can see that there might be a reason for one, but I would hate to do that
0 than have a state lottery.  Because when you bring,
0 see what happens.  I don't know.  At any rate, uh,
0 B:  Um, I'm surprised that m-, uh, my income taxes are as low as they are.  We
0 over twenty-two thousand dollars that we, it, it's our share to pay in.  But
0 me?  I guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot.  But, it's
0 B:  So when you start,
1 the welfare system,
0 going to the, some fat guy in the middle who's sitting there on his behind all
0 day doing nothing but filling out papers.
0 @@A:  Oh, well. Is that, you got anything else to say?  I don't think I do. 
0 B:  Yeah, I know, I mean I don't think machine guns, automatic weapons, I
0 B:  Yeah.
0 think.  That's kind of scary.
0 the radicals want to ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people
1 B:  and they're illegal [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, have, have gun, have, have gun management one o one [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, or, req-, required for every college student [laughter]. 
0 B:  Right exactly, [laughter] before graduation. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh yeah, they do.  They get real emotional about it.  All the, I've worked
0 then of course, they're hunters, they know what they're doing.  They don't
1 back.
1 B:  But, I guess that's it, my opinion on it.
0 really hate too.
0 think it's great, that you know, freedom of speech in this country and
0 everything, but if they're going to offer these services, or these recorded
0 of my privacy.  I agree with you on that particular subject there.  Let me
0 even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations, uh, but
0 around and doing missionary type work and, uh, I don't know, I just, um, don't
0 door on the front of the house and I've put, in, I don't know how much clearer
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, yeah, that's true, yeah.  No I don't, uh, I don't have, I
0 you know I don't think that that would stop people.  I, it's like they see that
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 B:  Pretty close.
0 B:  But, uh, we've done, uh, you know, in order to maintain ours, we've done
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh that's good.
0 B:  so, I, I suppose that the housing market is, uh, you know, it is on
0 B:  Well, I'm not really aware of those, I do know that, that our
0 problems in that, in that area of the house.
0 more, uh, more stable and, and puts more strength into it.
0 B:  Yeah, so that's, and that's what ours is.  Our, the house we had
0 well if you've got a, if you have a good builder [throat_clearing].
0 B:  Okay.
0 Instructions.
0 B:  Uh-huh. Yeah, I got a call yesterday too.  This is a different subject
0 A:  I think there really is.
0 changes in the generations.
0 the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her, I guess, she's in
0 options as far as, you know, what's it called, job sharing.
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  Or, a lot of women I know now and my, uh, one of my supervisors, when she
0 and she, you know, we could send her messages, and, and she kept in touch like
0 B:  And that's a real attractive option, if you have the, the technology for
0 come up with different options.   Do you like the job sharing?
0 B:  Oh, oh that's great,
0 A:  and we just share off like that.
0 B:  Yeah, especially with children, and so many things going on,
0 B:  Plus, I bet it cuts, cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two
0 A:  Yes, yes.
0 @A:  Uh, do you have a pet Randy?
0 actually my wife's dog, uh, I, I became part owner six months ago when we got
0 had dogs in the past and, uh, it seems, it seems to, uh, respond real well,
0 A:  It's, uh, part Chow and part Shepherd and it, as I understand it, uh, both
0 sides of the, were thoroughbreds.  So, she's a genuine ((Chowperd)).
0 A:  She has the, the color and the black to-, tongue of a Chow, but, uh, she
0 A:  it is a fi-, fixed female, by the way, 
0 A:  [Throat_clearing] You know, the first time I brought her home, she was
0 free run during the day but,
0 B:  Oh wow.
0 A:  which is, uh, on sort of a run.  I have a, a thirty foot cable,
0 B:  Yeah, that's interesting. 
0 A:  You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention.
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 home.
0 B:  Well that's great.
0 the laughter going on by both callers.
0 music do you like?
0 B:  Oh, really.
0 B:  Well, um, [laughter] I don't have that, I don't have that {both are
0 switch quite often.  Um, I think I like, I, I'm really particular about the
0 type of music that I listen to.
0 little bit of a lot of different types of music.  You know, I, I, I like music
0 the version is done right, I like it [laughter],
0 can really pick it up.  I mean,
0 A:  she thought they were brand new,
0 know, like standards, I guess you could call it.
0 remember that, that song.
0 B:  Jimi Hendrix was the original. 
0 A:  from him to use it.  And, he, he since then has, has amended that, and
0 know, come to think of it, I think that was a cover version of, like a John
0 like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times.  I mean I've heard
1 A:  Yeah.
0 hideous.
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think, I think it,
0 good stage performer.
0 A:  Um, um. Uh-huh.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 [laughter].  It was just,
0 mean, I like, you know, things like to hear, you know, what they call world
0 A:  Like Paul Simon.  Like,
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, it becomes a kind of music of it's own.  I mean, when you
0 A:  even thought it's really still there,
0 B:  {Talking to someone else in the room} You've got paper under your table.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  that by doing that we'll be free,
0 A:  and clear.  
0 B:  Huh.  Oh it's long term.  We just, he ha-, you know, his retirement plan
0 have our life insurance for right now.
0 B:  Yeah, that's what we're doing.
0 they, they've, um, you know, they've made them too easy and too accessible at

0 A:  I guess I ought to sometime.
0 card.
0 A:  You know, he'll go to, by Wal-Mart or something and,
0 costs or what it takes.
0 We're, we're infamous about that and so.
0 A:  Well six minutes, I've got a timer on my, uh, clock, on my phone.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah, we got big cash advance and really, that's what's, uh, holding us
0 back now that's, 
0 being here eleven years have a tendency to, uh, find out the, uh, about the
0 oh, being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of, a lot of, uh, building
0 A:  And, uh, oh, I guess I like a variety of things, uh, lots of fiction, uh,
0 B:  I bet that would be, rather interesting.  Uh, that's, uh, self
0 they give you books and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact I read was, AT
0 better be serving someone who is.  
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, well, uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  [Laughter] Like what for example.
0 to be successful and sort of talking to yourself.  You know ge-, getting your,
0 what you really want to do.
0 difficult to, to know if it's, you know, I think if somebody would say hey,
0 have a hard time finishing books.
0 a, on a life sentence, we should start hanging them and get it over with and
0 let's just screwing up the system.
0 night, that they said the average time a sentenced murderer, you know, is in
0 sentence someone for between, you know, two months and fifty years and, you
0 B:  You know, it's crazy.
0 other things would be more useful than that.
0 A:  just shouldn't be allowed to, to even, even live. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth, today, in eight to four and
0 money for people to, uh, you know, go back to court and all the lawyers and, I
0 doing that.
0 A:  Exactly.
0 B:  And the victims, you know, the family of these people that have been
0 murdered, they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they
0 ever get any resolution.
0 number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more.
0 B:  Well if I, I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I believe from
0 the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved, it could, you could have
0 a, a judge that would really make a good impact.  But likewise, you could have
0 good old boy network or for whatever reasons, you know, politics, just let all
0 through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they
0 A:  Yeah, I get back to Price's comment when he, uh, was found guilty he said
1 well he didn't have any blacks, uh, you know, from his neck of the woods.
0 I.
0 background, but I wasn't sure.
0 B:  Oh yeah, I've got the dog and two kids waiting here, I'm just locked up in
0 Caller A.  Tape jumpy in the middle of combined conversation.
0 A:  Okay, um, I don't know about you but where I am we have a like an extremely
0 nice.
0 have a pair of those at home too.  It sure would be cool and comfortable to
0 wear, you know, but.
0 because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts
0 hose on, but still, it's, they're shorts, I don't care what you say, they're
0 B:  Oh, it is definitely lined out.  Women are not allowed to wear slacks,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 if stuff like that would, will hold you back, you know, if you don't dress in,
0 So that's just,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, look at this slick guy, I wonder what kind of money does he
0 @@A:  I can see it now.  Well it was good to talk to you.  It was really
0 A:  It really is.
0 A:  Oh, yuck, yeah.
0 B:  #Okay, bye.#
1 B:  Weather-wise.  Damp, cold, warm [laughter].
1 so.  Had a lot of people out at work, you know, for fishing, and, and uh,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Yes.
0 total accumulation.
0 course we are, um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south,
0 B:  But, uh, otherwise w-, as I said, we have had, uh, a relatively mild
1 B:  Well, I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere.
0 A:  [Laughter] Very much, very much, cause I, I spent thirteen years there.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 series.
0 uh, personal identification number.
0 B:  Oh. O-,
0 A:  Well, actually, I, I work for Texas Instruments, and, uh, I'm an a, I'm an
0 the program and so forth, so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in
0 A:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, I see.
0 Dallas area.  What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this
0 A:  And, uh, our, [static] our chemical data base, so that we know every
0 chemical on site and, and, um, it's concentration, and if, if anything ever
0 A:  Yeah, that's cool.
0 B:  Sure, yeah, I like them.
0 B:  Okay, well, I just didn't know that much about music and I wasn't sure what
0 really low,
1 up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Que-, you, you're talking Queen, is that what you said?
0 B:  Yeah, that, that was a real good one.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 example, his, his record like, No Jacket Required.
0 A:  Yeah.  I saw it when it opened.
0 Ebert,
0 A:  They said the music's great, it took me back to the sixties, and stuff like
0 don't like disco, I've never liked disco.
0 B:  That's true.  But, I was more in the late seven-, well, I shou-, like mid
0 seventy-eight,
0 A:  Okay.
0 it's like, like the, the eighties are called, like the progressive years, or
0 A:  Yeah, that's a good example to look for in history.  Well, from now on
0 was pretty bad times.
0 A:  Oh, well, let's see, yeah, okay, we've been talking for seven minutes, so,
0 time, so,
0 A:  #that bad.  Bye, bye.#
0 B:  Hi  [baby_crying].
0 B:  Oh, yes, we've, uh, been, um, we've gone other, you know, all kinds of
0 B:  No, I don't.
0 A:  Yeah, I don't either, it makes it a little bit easier, I think, that way.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 know, just see, count, see how things are going in our family and, you know,
0 go in the backyard and sit down an,
0 A:  Especially since my youngest one is [sneezing], excuse me, only fourteen
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah.
0 animals and stuff.
0 B:  We take, you know, whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think it's
0 dollars admission per child, all day.
0 B:  The petting farm, yeah.
0 little quarter rides, you know, to, and stuff like that but,
0 sure that will be good.
0 B:  And, uh, he was a native and had gone to school there,
0 chemical plant down there.  I almost moved there when I was in high school.
0 want to go, because she didn't play golf or tennis and [laughter] [breathing]
0 thing to me, oh, it must have been great.
0 A:  But, um, what do you think about, about, um, their situation, should
0 A:  Okay.
0 B:  That makes sense.  I mean there's, uh, lots of tiny islands in the South
0 Pacific that are territories like that they could make states like, Guam or,
0 uh,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 all these other places to get there.
0 A:  Oh, yeah, he thinks,
0 but the ones I met have been pretty, pretty funny.
0 understand.
0 quite small and, and realistically could be sabotaged quite, quite easily.
0 approach and, and, and do we, do we support the Sandinistas or, or do we
0 you gave them a free election, they would vote for the, Will you, uh, did
0 infl-, Soviet influence in, in what's considered to be the United States
0 economic.  I don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and, um, from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more
0 that, that we have that, uh, it, it reality doesn't make, uh, doesn't make any
0 difference if he has no income.  And apparently even some of our alleged, uh,
0 B:  It is, it is interesting, that, that, you know we, we look at the
0 and, and Americans have, uh, have a pretty good reputation of exploiting, you
0 tremendous drug traffic through there, but, uh,
0 they, you know, would they be better off under communism.
0 question is can, uh, can you, can, uh, can a democracy, uh, afford the, it's
0 B:  Oh, yes.
0 B:  I'm, I'm not a great television watcher in any respect but, uh, the
0 B:  No [sigh],
0 B:  [Laughter] this week [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, he does.
0 B:  I particularly enjoy, I don't know whether you've had a chance to watch
0 A:  Oh, what's that about?
0 B:  with the permanent secretary,
0 B:  At T I?
0 A:  No, uh, I have a friend who works for T I and I work for a tire service,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 that so much was lost in the translation, particularly since most of the
0 A:  Yeah.
0 became a state.  Uh, so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the
0 that some of the more northern territories need.  However, in that case, I
0 now.  But of course if their economy is weak the-, there is not much of a base
0 on which to tax.  I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as
0 being able to vote.  The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite
0 are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would

0 any sort of structured, this is my exercise time --
0 mountaineering, a little mountaineering, this and that, and I spend a lot of

0 that way too as far as, you know, just sitting and doing, you know, to, the
0 B:  you're a calcu-, you know calculated down and do your calisthenics,
0 get a week.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  Is that why you like aerobics classes, because you're
0 B:  And, it's got, and I've always enjoyed dance.  
0 B:  So it involves, you know, I, I can't get out to dance all the time and, 
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  instead of me having to think about it so much.
0 B:  and, biking and I, I, I love to swim, so I love it when, you know, it's

0 B:  I was going to say there have been several times when I know they had ice
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  [Laughter] Um, but, uh, yeah,

0 they're having company this weekend, so we had to move,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  the C B S news.  He mentioned, um, I guess it was Monday night or Tuesday

0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0 guess --
0 B:  we don't, yeah, we don't have any but we have, you know, plenty of
0 care of my own kids than let somebody else raise them.
0 A:  and I need, tha-, my kids I need to cut the strings on them, they're not
0 A:  So, you know, they're, they're good kids.
0 A:  You know, they do bad things but they're good kids.
1 B:  Well, you know, kids, kids [laughter].
0 A:  and that's another problem with day-care because you're not there so you
0 know.  They drop in to see if you're meeting all of the requirements by law
0 A:  Yeah, that's, that's, that's something that should be brought up with these
1 B:  Yeah, I don't either.  It's not until you have kids, I guess, you
0 A:  Well, uh, with me I just decided not to face it,
0 A:  All right.  Bye-bye.
0 A:  Okay.  Did it click?
0 A:  I did at first but, um, not really, no, not, I, I can't imagine eating

0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  But now if you cook them wrong you can loose the vitamins. 
0 supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem, so we got all fearful for our
0 uh, if the news we're getting is any good. So [laughter], 
0 A:  Uh, we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS, but I

0 [swallowing].
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  -- they won't say,
0 going to throw it away anyway.  #You know.#
0 dominated the conversation.
0 ==============================================================================
0 B:  Well, personally, you know, I think, you know, of course I'm sure we're
0 the, uh, CODA Plan.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 I kind of have to trade off, you know.  If you never see it you don't spend
0 we talked about with her was, you know, the need to save for our son's
0 numbers and said this is what's going to be available, all this is going to do
0 is give you a little spending money while you're there.
0 attend a state college.  And if he wants to go to a private college, he can

0 A:  I know.  And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them.  Uh,
0 an allergist,

0 A:  if they did,
0 three to one.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play. 
0 B:  Uh-huh?
0 B:  Well, yes, of course, we do have capital punishment.  And we've, you 
0 B:  maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know,
0 A:  I don't know, I just think, um, somehow I hoped that as a people we could
0 B:  Yes, uh-huh.
0 one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.
0 B:  Tha-, that's right.
0 B:  Not with me personally.  It is with a lot of other people. 
0 what they do in place of it.  You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you
0 A:  But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.
0 B:  Yes, it certainly does. 
0 B:  I think, we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of determ-, deterrent
0 that.
0 B:  Easiest way out maybe.  No, I don't think it's a monetary thing.
0 B:  Yes. 
0 B:  Yes, I wish I had the answer for that, everybody does. 
0 B:  certainly not. 
0 A:  hasn't had any crime. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Huh-uh.  Would, uh, would you be more in favor of, uh, you know, like a

0 A:  and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally.  I
0 B:  I sent off for stuff on it, but I don't remember that much.  about it.  I
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 the drugs and violence and sex [laughter] and everything here, and take them
0 A:  -- public, yeah.  Public hanging and this sort of thing, you know, so you
1 great deal of thought, you know,
0 know, like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, right. 
1 B:  Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and
0 B:  Yeah, yeah. 
0 that somebody had paid somebody to, you know, get supported, or,
0 A:  Suppose, uh, well, you know, they had a group who were construction
0 somebody else is going to scream, well, you didn't build one over here.
0 A:  It's, uh, the logistics of the thing that, uh, 
0 anything good or anything like that, but you know, I'm sure that there are a
0 lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing
0 B:  She started some type of, um, national organization for youth to
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Where they, they have, these, the social, in some sort of way, if you
0 particular chance, your chance of having to do something was, it was very
1 B:  Oh, yeah [laughter].
0 B:  but, you know, that it is incredible, you know.
0 A:  Yes. 
0 B:  but I, I just, you know, sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  That's what I do.  Just a second. {Talking to child in background}.
0 B:  Yeah. So tha-,

0 he can just do it right there at work,
0 A:  Right. 
0 day on.
0 B:  You're right.  And that's kind of silly.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  people have the, generally the same view.

0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Right.  Well take good care.  Take care of your little ones.
0 A:  What kind of, uh, things are you going to consider, you know, what, uh, you
0 amenities,
0 B:  yeah.
0 A:  you know, we bought the car new and after, um, well, well, well under 
0 expensive like, like, uh, uh, a Mercedes Benz, they don't have the history of
0 considered disposable.
0 A:  Really?  Oh I don't know.
0 B:  Mercedes and, even though they do a lot of the work themself then just 
0 A:  What kind of, what brand of car are you thinking about buying or ((like))
0 B:  a little bit better than some of the others but, uh, oh, I guess, I
0 A:  How come (( )) I've been kind of, um, I guess the commercials are getting
0 we've had some work done on them but it's not too bad, and the reason, one of
0 B:  and, you knew it had, had been through a whole lot,
0 B:  I thought they would [clicking],
0 American or if I'm going to go for a little more, what I would consider to be
0 B:  Yeah {background noise}.
0 A:  Oh {Sounds like typing noises in background}.
0 A:  I like photography a lot,
0 [throat_clearing] uh, I play the guitar and a banjo.  I mainly play the guitar

0 A:  Oh, that's great.
0 A:  Um, hobbies, I like, messing around in your house building things, and, you
0 B:  Oh yeah, that's great, too.
0 A:  and then say, man this is really good,
0 A:  only way to do it. 
0 weren't as interested in it as we were, you know, so, uh, that was a real, I'd
0 A:  there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people and that's about it
0 B:  Okay.  
0 vote because they don't really think their, their, uh, opinion is going to be
0 believe a lot of different ways on,
0 Republican every year, you know, and, uh, the people that are independent, you
0 liberal like they are now, you know, would never be thought of, it would be
0 it, too, because, you know, every year the, the, the politicians are the
0 A:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  
0 B:  they, they each think that, uh, if more people vote, they'll get more
0 B:  and, uh, still on the other hand we're also, uh, this particular
0 A:  Yeah, that's true. 
0 areas, the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the
0 we'll see you in four years.
0 B:  (( )) hope some of the local, well that's what they, they keep saying that
0 B:  [Baby_talking].
0 B:  Yeah [/Baby_talking].
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  I didn't study it that hard so maybe I'll figure it out. 
0 A:  that was an interesting topic. 
0 A:  too, if you ever come to, to Dallas area. 
0 B:  Yeah, right next to Dulles. 
0 California baseball.
0 B:  Yeah, let's see, but I think, I think the Rangers need to go and I think
0 A:  Do you ever go see the Rangers?
0 B:  I know, but they try every year and every year they get thrown out.  It's
0 B:  But, uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice, and I heard that
0 you, so.
0 the Bart man, the Simpsons [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, you are?
0 A:  Yeah, my h-, my husband teaches in Plano.
0 B:  Is that a tough system to be in?

0 B:  but the politics, the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes.
0 so many of them [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 or,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 said, okay, I want to see a curriculum guide, you know, so I'll know what I'm

0 A:  But most of the time really we watch them on the video.

0 brick and everything else, nothing, you know, he did everything else.
0 can basically be, be put on any lot, in any state, any kin-, you know, so
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  But, uh, I have heard that your approach is, is right, you can actually go
0 B:  you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things and,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 know, it's ours.
1 A:  Ap-, apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high
0 B:  Oh, that's, uh, that's, uh, an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell,

0 both sides and then you take it out of the fat and you, you let the chicken
0 uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.  Stir it real, real well.
0 B:  And that's going to, it's going to be really good [laughter].
0 mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth,
0 A:  and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze,
0 A:  Oh, you don't [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, that sounds good.  We, we were from North Carolina and we had a garden
0 A:  See, never, no vegetables in my family.
0 B:  And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub and finally it
0 A:  Oh, this is ter-, you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while
1 A:  That's right, you should be careful [laughter].  That's pretty funny.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Well that's good.  A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 @@A:  Yeah,  well have we done our ten minutes.
0 A:  But, uh, I've been cut off twice.
0 more probably.
0 you think of the most.
0 choose from a sort of a menu of what jobs would might be available at any
0 participate, I guess, I would not be against that as a requirement.  I, I'm
0 not sure the country needs it, but I don't know that I would be against it and
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  Huh-uh. Huh-uh. {voices begin to echo}.
0 can't afford to keep up and we probably, in order to return them to a state of
0 A:  Yeah, I, uh, I think I agree, uh, like I guess I had that in the back of my
0 mind like the ((W P A)) and some of those,
0 A:  certain type of projects.
0 bucks a month to, uh, spend at the P X  [laughter].
1 B:  that's, that's past the point now where I can use them as an excuse, but,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  I'm, I like to go after them big old black bass.
0 around here.  I do a lot of, oh, just small farm fishing, I mean small farm
0 A:  rock pit fishing, but I've been to, uh, oh, the last, I guess the last
0 A:  Oh, are you? 
0 bite I'll fish for, and my brother-in-law likes to fish for crappie,
0 you know, I fish for bass. Fish, but basically like I said, fish for what,
0 B:  I don't know enough about fishing to, you know, to say, uh, I'm going to go
0 lures, so that's generally,
0 A:  But, it's, uh, you know, I, I got into that mode where I was buying lures
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, the last time I had anticipated fishing, I thought I might
0 have, uh, well, if you have a Texoma license you can fish anywhere on the
0 B:  Yeah, well, that's what I understood anyway.  I, I discovered it was much
0 there wasn't anybody else fishing, you know, in the group, so I said, well, I
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, he's about my favorite. 
0 B:  And, uh, then I take the Texas Fisherman. 
0 B:  along the coast.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  And, then, of course, I guess, the Bass, you know, the Bass Anglers book
0 B:  So you don't get a lot of Texas, you know, in particular,
0 A:  Yeah, it's really more, kind of all over the south,
0 sign up, you know, to, to sign up for the thing, you know,
0 B:  right.

0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Some of them, it takes a little while,
0 A:  to get them to do, what you think they ought to be doing.
0 B:  I think is the term,
0 with a little head on it and then just tie a piece of uh, of rubber pork type
0 A:  but, yeah, that's what it is.  
0 A:  Okay, I guess its recording.  Um, what kind of hobbies do you have?  Do you
0 @B:  Well, I, um, I do cross-stitch and I enjoy reading and playing softball.

0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Oh, well that's good.
0 B:  So you don't have too much time for hobbies?

0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, talk too long.
0 about the money because we need to hear from you.
0 A:  Any, any, um,
0 B:  Yeah.  What are you, what are you studying?
0 A:  With those degrees?

0 that your looking for?
0 for, uh, um, long distance --
0 B:  And she gets paid for that so she brings some money in.
0 B:  Alterations and sewing.
0 guess, that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the
0 A:  Right.
0 knew he needed an alarm clock.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Because it's like, you know, say, you know, it's like, we were saying,
0 let's go eat out before spring break.  I go, let's not go eat out,
0 A:  And if I felt like I spent way to much then, um, I won't go out, you know,
0 business and then trying to get my garden going.
0 B:  Oh, yeah, it's been beautiful this last week but,
0 B:  Mile a Minute.  That's the name of it.
0 guess that is your standard knitting, isn't it?
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  Usually single crochet would, is, is always starts it off.
0 B:  If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or
0 A:  Instead of call waiting or call anything else.
0 away.
0 A:  Well, that's kind of the way I am, um.
0 A:  #I planted, uh, zucchini# last year.  Uh, I planted four hills of them.  I
1 when a good time for zucchini is.
0 A:  It may not be, it may not be. 
0 B:  Probably the same time the, the other squash is though.
0 A:  #Well that's about, um,#
0 fine.
0 @A:  Uh, Robert what do you, uh, think, what substances do you think are the
0 B:  I understand it very well and in fact I was a private pilot there,
0 B:  Thick and brown and so on.
0 ruled against, uh, regarding air pollution because they think that it's
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  Uh, what do you think individuals could do, or society could do to
0 A:  Right.
0 What do you think we can do?
0 do, make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.  But, um, as a
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 only way that can happen is for, um, governments to realize that they have to
0 B:  Oh certainly, yes.
0 B:  we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch and I
0 about this time of year, this, you know, you see a little bit more rain.  I
0 of the year.
0 A:  Yeah, well, um, I don't know I, I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to
0 this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  Yeah, a little bit.
0 A:  and this, it was just, the humidity was like eighty plus, eighty percent
0 Monterey, California or,
0 B:  Yeah.
1 East situ-, [talking] well,
0 A:  Well [laughter] I mean I've had some pretty bad, I guess some pretty
0 controversial topics so it's just like well that was my fault.  But then the
0 B:  Right. 
0 experience at work.
0 A:  Yeah, well, they make allowances for that if you report that at the time
0 A:  Sure.  
0 A:  Uh, a couple of years, yeah.
1 A:  It took them awhile to find me.
0 A:  at first. 
0 A:  They called me in just a few months ago.
0 B:  Right, right.  You're right it wasn't a very pleasant experience.
0 the, for the nurse who was conducting the test in the health center though.
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  even though there is nothing to, uh, to worry about, as far as I know.
0 A:  It's just a matter of principle.  
0 B:  Well, uh, I guess growing up in the sixties, I don't know that particular
0 B:  -- and, you know, it's just a hangover from, uh, from that particular
0 in response to the drug testing.
0 the technical ladder of management and they're jeopardizing their positions.
0 questioning the validity of the results.
0 B:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, because you would be strongly into denial.
0 B:  [Laughter] It's just like well, we know you take it, we've got the positive
0 A:  Yeah, well, if you turn down the counselling, they will fire you.
0 A:  Well, do you have any, uh, television programs that you watch regularly?
0 A:  No. 
0 A:  Oh, you will? 
0 I will watch, um, like the cable news, network evening news program.

0 programs regularly.  My children like some of the morning children's shows,
0 A:  when they're home.  They, um, I just have one son who's in kindergarten
0 A:  show, but [throat_clearing], and they watch a couple of shows like that,
0 B:  Yeah, no I don't,
0 pretty regularly.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Um.
0 of pick up little tidbits from those.  I don't sit and watch them but, but I
0 enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or
1 B:  and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.
0 Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,
0 things that we can record and then,
0 B:  Yeah, we do some of that,
0 programs is the movies and they have a couple of channels that are like
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 to get hung up on it,
0 A:  spare time.
0 A:  And then I like the, they have a new one now.  The STAR TREK THE NEXT
0 A:  And I, I guess all, most of the shows I like are, are kind of along the
0 B:  And uh, I just decided I had to do that.  I think, in part because it was
0 to watch those.
0 A:  But, for the most part, I try, I have small kids and I try and keep it on
0 just a minimum amount of time, really when they're up.
0 a lot of SESAME STREET and a lot of ELECTRIC COMPANY, as well.

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I like to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times.
0 A:  They really are.
0 B:  That's right, wouldn't that be something.
0 A:  That's something you dream about.
0 A:  There is not ever a in between for him.

0 B:  And, uh, well I fell in love with this, uh, it's a Chinchilla Persian,
0 A:  Really.
0 A:  [Laughter] It's here now, we have to keep it.  Yeah, my, my first one that
0 A:  So I found this one and, uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell

0 A:  I know, I love mine too.  Well, it's been nice talking to you.
0 A:  Me to.  Bye, bye.
0 A:  straight winds.  And, and we could believe that, we were out in that at
0 that time.  It, uh, it, can be quite a horror story, I guess and I,  
0 degrees below zero and snowed.
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  And I'm sitting in this tent in my sleeping bag freezing, so I said, oh,
1 things going, of course, I got it going full bore.  I run out of propane.
0 A:  Huh.
0 shoot them.
0 A:  That's true.
0 B:  and now they're, now we're killing them because of something, some
0 everything is just, you know, you know, souvenirs and all this kind of junk.
0 sometimes with a family here and there, a couple of families get together but
0 down, that same weekend we had one, one college kid that, yeah, he thought he
0 and came on back.  Uh, let's see I had another, another camp out that wasn't,
0 glass and the like, but the actual sand was a real good quality and real deep
0 that time, at that stage in our life, our kids were, were, uh, real young and
0 A:  Yeah, you have to get pretty far out of the Dallas area to, uh, see the
0 people.  
0 B:  Yes it did, yes it did.  
0 B:  Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman, 
0 B:  Yes, uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that
0 B:  Yeah and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. 
0 Kmart everywhere?
0 B:  Yes.
0 scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the
0 disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks,
0 A:  but, boy there's a lots going on in there [laughter].
0 A:  Right, right.  I was, uh, I was so impressed with that movie I saw it three
0 think, about your own family.
0 B:  Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with
0 the switchboard process.
0 had to tend to.  I mean, you can't make it everybody.
0 too.
1 you are.
1 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 before they got any money.
0 A:  I'm just teasing [laughter].
0 mandatory thing for welfare.  Course that's what, um, that's sort of like what
0 B:  Caddo Lake.
0 B:  No, I've never heard of it.
0 A:  You know with all the Spanish moss on the trees, it's really, it's eerie.
0 a lot of, uh, um, you know, topics on social services, because, like this
0 A:  Mitch Snider, I don't know who Mitch Snider is.
0 advocate for the homeless that, uh, he, he's said it out here in Washington
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Excus-, uh, the other topic was, like I said, uh, something about
0 statement [dishes].
0 special dinner [laughter].
0 B:  Oh we have a lot of coal [laughter].
0 B:  No.
0 out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers wanted to participate, you know.
0 B:  Oh, I don't know.
0 I.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  they're testing that.  So, they're really not full, full force into it,
0 about, uh, building a garbage burning, uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  #Oh.#
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And, uh, that really, started a lot of stuff off, but, you know sometimes
0 B:  And it's hard enough to find good packing boxes (( )).
0 A:  Right and, and these boxes are, you can unfold them.
0 B:  That's exactly what I do.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I mean, they're real hard to find the places that pay.  And that's really
0 and some other category,
0 B:  Well that's, that's good.  
0 B:  Right, right.  And we had, uh, a write up in our paper, uh, this last time
0 normal trash and every other day they do your recycling trash.
0 B:  And when they were questioned about it they said well, we're running
0 B:  But luckily that will all get straightened out and, and they'll, they'll
0 A:  Uh, the last movie that I saw, I, I don't go to that many so I'll just have
0 B:  No unfortunately I haven't, I heard it's really good, but.
0 A:  No, it was very serious, very se-,
0 A:  Oh, I saw it.
0 B:  It was telling a friend, I, I said, I only cried twice, but each was about
0 B:  Um, let's see, when I, each time that I thought that the Indians were going
0 B:  Um, I cried the first time when the, um, the wagon man got killed, when
0 parts right off now.
0 B:  It, there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie.  
0 B:  Yeah.
0 were moving so fast.
0 A:  That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves [barking].
0 automatic guns,
0 A:  Golly, well the,
0 A:  or around, around my area, everybody who lives out in the country has a
0 B:  It's, it's the way they just brought up.  We-, uh, where are you from, by
0 though, I.
0 A:  Well, Jerry, do you have a favorite team?
0 couldn't play most the season.  They spent an awful lot of money on him, too,
0 Francisco.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 guys.  It wouldn't have been much of a contest.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  And of course the, the people end up paying for it are the fans.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 you, to get a decent seat you have to buy a season ticket.
0 A:  And, uh, every, every opportunity there is to make a dollar, he seems to
0 come here and own, uh, uh, Tex-, a team in Texas.
0 A:  Troy Aikman looks like to be, looks like he's got the star qualities for a
0 didn-, really didn't go for the, uh, big offensive lineman, or the defensive
0 the long run.  You can have the best half back there is or the best
0 A:  And, uh, the other teams in the N F C East, uh, they're, they're getting,
0 A:  I don't know what Philadelphia's going to do without Buddy Ryan, it might
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, and I think old, uh, I think Cunningham is an excellent quarterback.
0 A:  Oh, he's great, I saw him play when he as at, uh, U N L V.
0 unfortunately, they, uh, they got cut a little short.
0 B:  Yeah, well I don't they, uh, the games they lost, I don't think they lost
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  I'm sure he will.  He's not going to have problems there.  If not in the N
0 players, I can't believe that.
0 league are going to try to, uh, impress N F L scouts with their play in that
0 make a pro team.  There aren't going to be too many people that, that'll make,
0 uh, the N F L out of, uh, W L A F.
0 experts all at once.
0 intent.
0 that maybe our world was a little bit better place when I was in high school
0 the evening and then they went on to, I don't know I think the Andy Williams
0 show or something that filled up the other fifteen minutes of that half hour
0 B:  Well you too.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 saying oh yes, we feel some day a woman will be president.  But, uh, I have
0 A:  Yes.
0 it's kerosene or what that's dropping.  But, other than that, you know, we
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh they've been getting cleaner.
0 B:  Sure.  But, um, yeah, I'm not sure how much the water pollution is, is
0 A:  Up, upstate New York somewhere,
0 A:  over huge areas,
0 A:  But I, I thought it was up there.  So, that's interesting because New
0 A:  Uh, natural disease,
0 article that well.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh, I'm not really sure.  You think that, that, that the, uh, the trucking
0 your tail pipe and, uh, the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts and
0 B:  Right.
0 that's a thought.  No,
0 A:  But you have one at work.
0 computers because, uh, you know, the software.  You know, like it's easier for
0 A:  that you can't use personal computers, so you have to use, you know, a
0 B:  And, that, that's been my situation, is that, uh, that way I can get in,
0 A:  And, you, you know, you just do it that way. 
0 B:  Um, so I think it's extremely helpful and very useful.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 that.
0 A:  Due, due to the fact that, well, you know, I, I haven't tested the, the P S
0 A:  And, especially if you have a laser printer, it's going to print out the 
0 software that I had was, it was basically, you know, you only see part of the
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  What a hassle, yeah, yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 numbers.
0 B:  Right.  Right.
0 A:  Instead of saying, where did I make the error?  
0 A:  get out of that, run the program, 
0 A:  Di-, did, did you learn it in computer science?
0 it away.
0 A:  to them.  
0 A:  Because of, of their, you know, you can work with it a lot easier.
0 B:  Okay.
0 B:  Not anything too nice because we have a four year old.
0 B:  Yeah, and are loud so when he gets loud it's not too, it doesn't bother the
0 A:  Uh-huh.  But don't, don't you,
0 B:  [Laughter] So that's just like every day food for you, huh.
0 cooks Italian food and it's just like, you know, there, you know, she,
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  So, you know, 
0 A:  you know, with our hangover from Saturday and we go to, uh, Taco Bell and
0 money.
0 B:  I mean I like the way it taste good and it's fast.  I like that too.
0 B:  they're kind of convenient.
0 B:  Um, I usually have parties that are smaller groups.  I don't have, I've
0 and, um,
0 A:  Uh, we, it's funny that, um, we're talking about this, we just had a dinner
0 Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff, and, uh, well
0 And I made blueberry cobbler [laughter] and we had extra crust with it,
0 A:  So, um, I've ((read)) a good brownie recipe.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Okay, uh, you want to start by telling me what camping is to you.  Do you
0 group of friends that I run around with, of varying degrees, uh, of
0 A:  Oh, man, I imagine.
0 A:  God, that sounds like fun [laughter].
0 A:  and so we would go up to the Sacramento, uh, river sloughs, the delta
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  And so we did that, uh, I guess we haven't done it since my kids were born
0 B:  But we're, we're starting to get everybody back together.  Yeah, we'd
0 scared, that risk of like gosh, what could happen and then the thrill of, you
0 property, I grew up in South Dakota,

0 few years ago.  
0 A:  Yeah,
0 A:  The Blackwoods.
0 A:  Yeah,
0 A:  Yeah.

0 B:  and so, the best bet, any, anymo-, these days are compact disk, those
0 B:  -- and the radio is, you know, more exciting,
1 B:  -- i-, i-, kept and yo-, it just didn't vegetate your mind like television
0 B:  I, I do.  Because, uh, with all, all the sports, you know, and everything
0 if, if you are on drugs, then that affects the way you work and everything.
0 A:  -- to, uh, just do, d-, we called it the golden flow, but [laughter] and
0 A:  It's no big deal.  
0 B:  Yeah, because, like wha-,
0 you are on.
0 To a lot of kids, uh, like, you know, like, somehow they missed the physical
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  I think this way, too because in that steel mill, I mean
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 strenuous jobs.
0 traffic controllers, your nurses, your doctors.
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah.  
0 people would even come in periodically and have unexpected checks, you know --
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.  
0 A:  So, everybody's getting checked.  It's not like it's just little peons,
0 you know it's random because some people is already gone two, three times and
0 some people ain't went at all.
0 B:  You know, like, it's not like they just, like, well, then the second time
0 ster-, well how long does it take for marijuana to get out of your body?
0 A:  They said it was thirty days, but, (( )) on one of ((my our)) our thingies

0 A:  They're no different.  
0 B:  And they're out winning awards, 
0 B:  you know, and then, and then the younger kids think they're
0 B:  Exactly.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 problem and they come out and they say they're having the problem, so then
0 A:  Yeah, but so is cigarettes.  
0 A:  And some people are addicted to prescription drugs.  
1 A:  it's like, huh-uh, huh-uh, no.  They need, they need some help, too

0 A:  I think they gave him like four pills [laughter].  
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 for everyone?
0 ready, and I think it gives a different perspective.
0 B:  Right, uh, y-, I, I think if you've been out of school a year, year and a
0 A:  The only complication is, is, is how do you fund something like this?
0 B:  Right.  And the parents fund them for the whole year, year and a half that
0 colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in, in trying to

0 A:  Have a good night.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- and almost anything you do now, a Social Security number is required.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- which I think is a, is an invasion of privacy.  
1 A:  I agree [laughter].  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 a series of numbers, but some of them are sold, and I know you talking about
0 mailing lists, the [breathing], I, there is one particular group to which I
0 know, they pretty much know that you're at work all day and they call you
0 with.  And, and I've gotten a lot of them lately, or I'll, sometimes I come
0 you know, it's kind of irritating, but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the
0 B:  -- it irritates me.  
0 B:  when I, when I do that because, you know, she's a teenager --
0 answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone, but now with this
0 office.
0 B:  Now what I have done is, I have forwarded my home phone --

0 B:  All right, well thank you for calling.  I ha-, I,
0 A:  Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.  
0 B:  What did you think of it?  
0 A:  Steve Martin did a pretty good job.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  I thought it was interesting how they cast that movie with, uh, Victoria
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 man chasing a woman and that's my big fear so,
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah.  I, I want to see that.  As a matter of fact I intended to go one
0 B:  Huh.
0 finished, so he has,
0 life is like, uh, in a, uh, moderately normal suburb.
0 B:  Oh, well that is interesting [clinking].  
0 B:  Oh.  
0 that you could take a child to?
0 B:  Oh, well, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.

0 A:  Have you seen THE FIELD over at the Inwood?  
0 A:  Uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I haven't seen either one of the other films she was in, but, uh, my
0 A:  she's really good.  
0 B:  I, I, one of the things that I was really impressed with, uh, she has to
0 B:  Yeah, uh, I think it's like in the, I don't know, Alabama, Georgia, South
0 Carolina area or something.  It's, and she does a real good job sounding like
0 B:  The man that plays this bizarre character is really, I don't know if I've
0 A:  Anthony Hopkins? 
0 A:  Okay.  Yeah, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY with Julia Roberts,
0 A:  I haven't seen PRETTY WOMAN yet, uh, have you seen that one? 
0 A:  That was, uh, which one was that.  With, uh, Clint Eastwood and Donna
0 A:  almost identical.  
0 B:  Huh.  Well, I liked it until, toward the end I, I didn't care for it too
0 B:  having seen the last generation, I guess it puts me in, you know, gives
0 uh, there's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from
0 B:  with children in that situation.  I, I guess one knows one's own
0 uh, an increasing equality, uh, greater presence of women in management 
0 B:  not to be crass about it, but, uh, 
0 B:  For instance, that, and I could, you know, I could envision a society where
0 A:  That's right, that's right.  
0 and had one in being a parent.  I, I don't know that I, uh, felt myself
0 B:  Or to put their child into a s-, into a home setting, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  rather, rather formidable.  
0 A:  It's been interesting.

0 hospitals and, uh, and the shelters and stuff like that.  [Sniffing] And even
0 A:  yeah, my kid will do four or five hours this week for me.  #No

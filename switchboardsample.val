0 B:  As a recurring character every week?
1 B:  Oh.
0 B:  Um, I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to

1 B:  or something.
1 A:  Yeah, he had my vote double [laughter].
0 B:  Yes, I have. 
0 as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low sta-, uh, standard of living or
1 B:  Uh, I see what you mean, so that, 
0 B:  I think I would be troubled, I suspect, I believe that any of our states,
0 A:  Right.
0 guess.
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 not, sort of, someone else is doing the counting for you, so, 
1 B:  Oh, I didn't realize that.

0 Israel is going to occupy the area, or the Arabs are going to occupy the area
1 B:  Yeah, that's, that's nice to do, that is.  [breathing] I've got a,
1 or something,
0 A:  I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in
1 A:  and dark hair.  
0 A:  -- and, uh, they,
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  You know, drunk people, 
0 B:  That's true.

0 anything else offhand, that, uh, 
0 with.  And, and I've gotten a lot of them lately, or I'll, sometimes I come
0 B:  -- it irritates me.  
1 that's, that's where answering machines are nice, because if it's really
0 A:  But, uh, at work I have so many phone calls from customers calling in,
1 A:  Okay.  
1 B:  Well,

1 kids to serve for, uh, parents, I guess.
0 uh, go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over --
0 B:  That's one thing we do at our church is, uh, [throat_clearing] we have a
0 that.  And I'm convinced that, that, that at least twenty-five percent of our
1 A:  #And she thinks, yeah, twenty-five# percent.  It, it was a small school
1 B:  That's great.  But, uh, like, I'll agree with you, though, I don't think
0 A:  may be a problem.  
0 B:  I don't see how they can just,
1 B:  I wish I could do something like that, but [breathing] #I can't, so
0 You know, it, it's taking time, but --

0 entertainment while I was in school.
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  [Static] How do you usually keep up with current events?  
0 B:  over the years.   
1 anyway.
0 B:  -- and there was no other choice.  You couldn't take them in your own home,
0 like those, those options now, and, and I think about it more often because my

0 A:  Oh for heaven's sake.  #What a cheapskate.#
0 Dallas schools, the admini-, um, can't think of his name, but the idea --
0 B:  and, and all these other people are out running around.  I guess that's
1 B:  #And, and #[laughter],
0 B:  -- and that is, that's what makes, there's a lot of problems.  But anyway,
0 um, I'm trying to think how much longer.  I had a conversation, week or so ago
1 A:  I know it, I know it [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  #I, I do,# I find out, and there's a law that just the things you get in
0 B:  -- I, you know, my, my name being sold if I, if I give money to the World
0 and go ahead and hang up.  But, I, I don't know, I don't think most people are
0 A:  -- #and therefore I think# it's an invasion of privacy --
1 B:  -- and, um, and then they start asking, you know, well is your wife there.
0 B:  You know, and I'll say, I'll say, no she's not, because actually my wife
0 A:  #Most, a lot of# women, a lot of women, most women control the budgets and
0 B:  -- and they called me for, um, what else other than water softener, the
0 A:  (( )).
0 a nap, they may, uh --
1 know, you don't want to go in #the public bathroom.#
1 B:  Well, that's good.
0 A:  Yeah, I couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life to, to go do
0 B:  But, uh,
1 A:  Kind of like joining the military.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 either.  So, [breathing] I, I, it's interesting we got this topic because I,
0 A:  I certainly didn't mark off anything to get this one.  I, I can't imagine,
0 actually talk to somebody about it.
0 and it was hot here, and it was snowing there.  So that was pretty
1 was caught a little off guard, and I couldn't think of anything at all.  So I
0 A:  Right.  We've got a few things, too.  It's hard to tell if they'll come
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  It's better for, for a large yard.
1 B:  Uh, they finally got smart and got a riding lawn mower which was a big
0 about a dollar.  And, uh, he has never got it to us, so it just sits out
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  We have, uh, I think it's a Silver Leaf Maple or something like that,
1 B:  Oh, I had a Red Oak a few years ago that I bought from, uh, from a guy who
1 sold trees off the back of a trailer [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, well that's too bad.  We've got all of our trees from Calloway's, and
1 can,
0 A:  Back when I had time to watch T V, oh, maybe last year when I wasn't doing
0 A:  I know, it's funny that, that women even like that show, because he really
1 B:  Uh-huh [laughter].
1 B:  Right [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, God.
1 B:  Uh-huh.  Oh gosh.
0 it with reporters --
1 B:  Oh.
0 her car in the morning, but it wasn't iced over.  So I just left my car out
0 offshore wind which is blowing straight out.
1 somewhere around Topeka.
0 just, like laying on top of me or something.
0 B:  Oh, hurtle, oh, okay.
1 B:  No, well, last, uh, no I do enough other things, I don't feel guilty about
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 they, 
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  They have to be short enough that they'll still fall back down --
0 A:  Um, I real-, I've got a mixture I guess [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And, uh, I'm trying to find a way how to electrify it or motorize it
1 [laughter]. Because this I have to push.
0 B:  [Laughter]  Oh, well.
0 B:  Oh well.
1 B:  It might help, I don't know. 
0 you know, there's no,
0 [static].
1 A:  [Laughter] And he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring
0 B:  The styles, uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- and we went to two movies.  We went to see AWAKENINGS --
1 A:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  That's strictly for entertainment [laughter].
0 this thing with, uh, Danny De Vito called TWINS.
0 B:  And, and some of the other things.  Um, TOTAL RECALL last year I thought
0 B:  Um.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, and I, I have some, one person at work I know gets really into
1 watch, I really do, because my youngest one, he watches something, you might
1 A:  They're eight and ten.
0 B:  Um.
0 B:  you know.   
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 B:  went to Las Vegas.  I went from route five to Las Vegas by car,
0 B:  I've lived here all my life and I worked, uh, I've been with, uh, T I
0 (( )) and pine, of course, evergreens up, as you get up north into the

0 the, the level of evidence that they come up with now, I mean, you know, when
0 B:  Yes, I know.  I mean, I only heard portions of that but it's absolutely,
0 B:  terrible.  And, you know, if you beat a dog like that, they'll put you,
1 [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 stupid, and, and then things like that, and they built up, I remember feeling
0 individually, and then that was it, then they had to have the Master beat 
0 A:  -- because the, the lesson was passed to the young generation and the older
1 snob,
0 there's always something that, uh,
0 term, will occur to allow you to handle what we've put ourselves through.
0 B:  And so you don't, you're not able to, well, I guess you are able to, if you
1 need [laughter].
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  -- Modern Tire.  And, uh, it's also a retreading plant, and that's where
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 day we declared war was my time [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, man, yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Wow!
0 B:  -- like, you know, on, on a, on a greater frequency than maybe,
1 A:  Huh.
0 B:  #Oh, Lord.#
1 B:  Oh.
1 house at the same time.  So we're, I'm sitting here in my forty year old
1 A:  Oh yeah.
1 A:  No, I wouldn't think so [laughter].
1 stay home and finish it, I'd feel a lot better, but, uh, I'm, I'm starting to
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, we do.  It, uh, it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't.
1 A:  Yeah, uh-huh.
0 B:  they're supposed to be bilingual.
0 independent, maybe,
0 uh, it's very, I don't know, it's called (( )), or they have loudspeakers on
0 B:  Yes, Cuba's very close.  But, uh, particularly, it's like, uh, I live in
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah, you probably get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.
1 sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them.  Yeah, I have two nieces and
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 B:  Well, 
0 who an expert was.
0 but that, that it seems to be,
0 A:  Oh, I bet.   
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.   
1 motivate me [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, that's me.   
0 B:  So I think that's good.   
0 could, I could say well, I guess I was wrong about Ann Richards.
0 B:  That was a good, that was a good leadership that women,
0 company.  Can't remember the name of it, and she's a multimillion-, n-, naire
0 A:  -- you know, I, I don't normally do that at, at work.  Uh, and I, I
0 likes and dislikes.  And that's, that's, uh, that's where they, they were
1 A:  [Breathing] Uh, I'm, I'm networked into it, but it's so inconvenient for
0 tools to give to people who traditionally have had to go through a whole
0 they think need to be done and then maybe he can go from there.  Uh, have you
1 A:  I think so [laughter].
1 going to be in this home for a while,
0 a m,
0 A:  Dallas.   
0 B:  Yeah, it probably will.   
0 A:  So, we have to contend with doors that sometimes, sometimes during the year
0 some, some little areas where the soil is completely sandy and then it, it,
1 [laughter].
0 A:  Huh.   
0 B:  But there, uh, w-, as a first time home buyer I know what you mean.
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  and just hope they break or something [laughter].   
0 A:  Huh.   
0 A:  That's interesting.  I didn't know they could do that.   
0 A:  So, it's, it's really kind of crazy.
1 B:  same, uh, same socializing, same exact crowd that they hang with and it's
0 ropes.  You know, there were things like that, that mattered a lot more and I
0 A:  that, you think this isn't sinking in.   
0 B:  Even, even more so, uh, like, military academy grads are a strange lot,
0 A:  Not realizing that the reputation for M I T is because of the, of the
0 [breathing] Uh, so they p-, they, they want, you know, they want the best and
0 B:  For me any time I needed extra help any time of the day -- 
0 B:  Right.   
0 A:  Yeah, it's , it's about a movie about, you know, this guy who was running
0 B:  great.  Uh, and the little boy was good, too.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.    
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 Jim Morrison.
0 me that SISKEL AND EBERT said that one of the two liked the whole movie, but
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Uh, you get a bigger pool of all the different regions of and, and,
0 B:  to eat.   
0 A:  July and August, yeah.   
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 anymore.
1 A:  -- the, the fast mowing places.  You had to buy a big one, you know,
1 it back to them and traded it in for another one that was smaller.
0 whole day from a hangover [laughter].  And not going to work, but, I, that was
0 and, and unfortunately, and I think cocaine's a, a good example, it's, it's
1 B:  -- is there going to be enough there to get me, get me in troub-,
0 A:  And it's a twenty-four hour station.   
0 B:  Especially, like, when they have special singers and things, and LA CAGE
0 factor standpoint,
1 A:  I never managed to plan my departure right.   
0 B:  Five years.    
1 A:  Hopefully.   
1 A:  I'll take my chances with it.   
0 B:  Oh, I don't.   
0 A:  and find out how your weather compares to the caller's weather.
1 and the whole island wanted to know when the hanging was going to take place.
1 A:  Okay.   
1 A:  Well, say hi to Al, or Hal the next time you see him.   
0 A:  All right.   
1 B:  and then, uh, well, we've been taking the TIMES HERALD for ages and then,
0 B:  I listen to K R L D, and, uh, uh, K L I F, the news talk radio.
0 B:  And, and so it's kind of a, oh, that's what's interesting is the C N N, uh,
0 we have the option of not watching that station.
0 B:  Do you work for T I?   
1 B:  Oh, I see.  Yeah, so then we've been having just about the same weather
1 A:  [Laughter] Okay I can believe that, uh-huh.   
1 go to the beach next Wednesday,
1 B:  Yeah.  I'm sure it will in Dallas, Texas [laughter].   
0 A:  [Laughter] {pause} Well that's pretty typical, though.  U I don't, uh,
0 B:  It's just really pretty with the snow and the ice and all of the lights.
0 A:  Seventies to eighties, I guess.   
0 A:  I've been checking on my plants, seeing the, the roses bud out already.
0 B:  Oh.  
1 A:  So I like Gordon Lightfoot, do you know who he is?   
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].   
1 A:  Yeah.   
1 c-, but we do have, I like Simply Red, we got Simply Red.  I figure all our C
1 A:  Just because there's a friend up there, not because there's much else
0 B:  So but,   
0 could be sentenced to thirty-five years and yet, you know, the, the parole
0 A:  So what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail?
0 A:  and they are not allowed, I mean, th-, some of them are even allowed to
0 A:  -- figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them
0 as citizens, I guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on
0 sentence on a person himself.
0 in th-, at the same time and decide what his punishment would be,
1 A:  Yeah, uh, I w-, uh, I was pulling for the Bengals when they, uh, lost the
0 B:  Huh.  I would think, uh, that if you were real cold and you hit, uh, hit
0 A:  -- in the long run I think it would really be worthwhile.  
0 A:  Well, Steve, I'll tell you, I think, I still think Joe Montana's the best
0 A:  that could be true, too.   
0 B:  Oh, yeah, that did in New England a couple years ago, didn't it?
0 A:  Oh, it certainly did.  It most certainly did.  Yeah, we, as I say, we went
0 A:  Uh, THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and, uh, uh, I forget the t-, the other, well he,
1 [breathing] a glossary in the back and it helps explain who people are.
1 B:  Yes.   
0 B:  [Sniffing].
0 B:  That's, 
1 B:  Yeah.   
1 B:  Yeah,  
1 A:  He's written a lot of books.   
1 A:  Uh-huh.   
1 really watch that?
0 A:  No.   
0 where gobs of land was, was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that
0 B:  or --   
1 A:  Uh-huh.    
0 loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico, Venezuela.
1 forty thousand dollars and they're all protected by the government.  Seems to
1 use [laughter].
1 of doing that,
0 A:  Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Yeah, nice way to start off this spring.   
0 A:  Well, that's good.  Well they say that walking is just as good if not
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 A:  or Jane Fonda.   
1 either.
1 A:  Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that.   
0 registration for this purpose or that.  So they just don't bother.
0 you know, how can I possibly make an informed choice here.
1 B:  Yeah.  You,
0 A:  does.  If, if, you know, if he, he does do something [laughter] or you
0 I'm raising children.  It ju-, it really is.
0 sixty-nine and seventy --
0 B:  the, the significant thing is, is today did, did you, uh, did you see
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 hollering injustice, I think that's wrong.  Now the question is, is was there
0 B:  there injust in Iraq Kuwait, 
1 A:  I know.
0 for one world government.  I'm not for all these new age things.  I, I, you
0 think it hurt.
1 A:  -- I've yet to have any so [laughter],
0 years.
1 A:  And all of that was new to me,  because I'm sort of feeling like we're
1 and, um, but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything
0 think.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  No, no, they have their own budget they go by. 
1 day.
1 plywood and putting up a few things, and it got to be hot summertime when I
0 British Virgins.
0 A:  -- and I had fun that, then a few years later a guy I was racing with, uh,
0 A:  Thank you very much.
0 A:  Right.  
1 B:  -- I'm only forty years old.  I have to work,
0 B:  -- getting ready to start to the Spring season, and see if I can grow me
0 B:  -- and it's pretty nice.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  When you touch them, they roll up.
1 survey,
1 B:  Right.  That's exactly right.
1 A:  without, uh, stopping for any reason whatsoever,  
0 B:  Yeah, that's fine.   
0 A:  And, of course, that was her decision at the time too, so.  And then in
0 A:  really marvelous thing,  
0 careful with as he should have been in the beginning, so, he deteriorated
1 him in a nursing home which was,
0 she stayed there with him instead because we just could not imagine a

0 A:  Yeah.   
0 A:  but still for the most part, she is wheelchair bound or bed bound.
0 B:  it's like you said that something more, you know, to, to make people
0 A:  And, um, hopefully to understand that everyone is not as, in-, as
0 B:  I think that's the trend now, and I think people are a lot more willing to
0 give of their time and help out.
0 A:  Yeah, it's an interesting idea, but I think we do agree and, [laughter].
0 B:  No, I don't think I would either.   
1 B:  Yeah, really.   
0 A:  Then you don't have, you don't have the mess to clean up when you use an
0 you use, uh, I mean, just brush and roller or,
0 painting walls and ceilings,
0 B:  Right, but, uh,
0 B:  Yeah, there's a solar house and some of those and I, I really haven't, you
0 B:  Well, that's what, my impression was that they, you know, that they were
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  and I thought for a while that that may create a problem but it hasn't,
1 as much problem, so.
0 B:  {Very faint} oh, yeah. 
1 A:  Really.   
1 an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock.  But, uh,
0 B:  and, uh, I never really, messed with anything, uh, gardening or anything
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 A:  Huh. 
1 plant grass and they just, [laughter], have some problems,
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 your back, you know,
1 B:  Well, either way it's, get, I guess, maybe we can define it as living away
0 B:  Oh, yeah.   
0 probably twenty miles longer than my normal way to work.  I live in Rhode
1 A:  And that's, that's pretty nice because you can fish and just,
1 B:  And good luck with your, uh, your fut-, your hopes of buy a Winnebago
0 B:  and ancient coins.   
1 night.
0 what you say.
0 B:  Uh-huh.

0 now.
0 A:  You know, the wheels of justice grind slowly.   
1 A:  That's it, I mean, Big Bird would make a good judge.   
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, that we're kind of stuck with them.   
0 than anybody's.
0 A:  Well, the coverage was a little bit ridiculous anyway, I mean.
0 B:  ((I think it was just rehash)),  
0 A:  I'm saying, what are you telling me that you didn't tell me in your first
1 half-hour.
0 B:  But it wasn't an exciting war it really wasn't [laughter]. 
0 B:  I just,  
0 B:  Oh, yeah.   
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 A:  um, works very well, and the Canadian health plan is probably the best
1 B:  Yeah, well, it, it may not last [laughter] once they,  
1 B:  But I, I try [laughter]. 
0 went out camping with some friends and he got poison ivy,
0 B:  and then, uh, get out on the road to boot, so.   
1 [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well, I used to.  I lived there for a long time.  But I'm now in
0 that because of the way they're bound they, uh, it's too expensive to recycle
0 back to be reused.
1 A:  Here they don't want your rotted tomatoes.   
0 B:  [Laughter].   
0 B:  I understand, uh, my husband about once a weekend he'll go, uh, to a couple
1 B:  Oh, yeah, I mean, they don't, uh, uh,
1 A:  But at the moment we're using the china cups, 
1 A:  {Very faint} Yeah.   
0 B:  Number one.   
0 probably don't have it, you know, I do have some dental problems and it's
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 I, it seems to me that, like you were saying earlier, that the deductibles are
1 once we got them through your courts but, uh,
1 listen to all the divorces so,
0 different, different types of cases that come in I mean it seems like just
1 B:  just one judge who sits there and listens to cases all the time would,
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 A:  we'll go ahead and call you another day maybe.   
1 A:  Right.   
0 because, uh, it used to be s-, so, f-, much in the past that whatever the top
0 getting stuck into something here, you know, if,
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 percentages are, but I heard it one time, it's just some ungodly number just
0 A:  you know, even if they're saying that beneath the doors.  But it's hard
0 whole thing.
0 A:  With two little kids I can understand that.   
0 all the politics and, uh, lobbying and just basically state by state events,
1 B:  yeah, I'm glad you put it that way.   
1 A:  Yeah, Texas participation in the Civil War was, uh, minor at, uh,
0 the Midwest which,
0 THE YEAR [laughter], oh, SPACE (( )) that was the one I was trying to wade
1 had a hole in my roof and I was waiting for the whole house to collapse,

0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  or french fries.  You have to, you have to have french fries with just
0 A:  have ((old bay)) on just about everything.
0 B:  And then, you know, I finally get sick of that one and then I'll find
0 B:  And your like, you'll do your own part, you know,
0 A:  Yeah, I [laughter], I agree.

0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, I'll say.

0 A:  I, I'd like to try that too. 
0 A:  Uh, because we have a delivery guy that comes around, that sells, I'm
0 know, a truck that comes around.  And, and they recently had hams.  They have
0 A:  I'm Jerry Crow. 
0 ki-, sides to everything.  And, and I, you know, I was, I've never been on a
0 uh, a majority for, uh, you know, a less severe case would be okay.  But I
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Uh, it varies even from state to state and even within state. 
0 B:  Oh, my word. 
0 A:  And, uh, also they didn't say anything to talk about it, but, uh, the rich
1 B:  And, and I, I could not be lenient at all.  And they asked me a couple of

0 A:  I think, that's one of the areas, uh, I've found several areas in the

1 B:  That's like another purchase for me.
1 those cards because J C Penney offered, you know, a free gift --
0 A:  I mean, they probably realized it was their mistake.
0 A:  # helping # the environment.  I mean, prison is such a waste of a human
0 them all.  Now to me, that is inhumane.  And for two people to be out in the
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
0 guess I would like to probably editorialize more.  We have to just report
1 A:  And I'll read your book sometime. 
1 A:  We've had all the rain that they should've had out in California. 
0 B:  What, what do you, do you put in up there? Do you, I mean, here we know, we

0 single digits.  And as a result, a lot of the, the trees and, uh, the grass
0 the one of the main reservoirs in the county I live in is, uh, fuller that I've
0 when my clearance came through for A P D, I worked for D E S E G.  Uh,
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  It's not something,
1 B:  But that was, uh, I believe because of the stockholders' meeting. 
0 B:  So it's, uh, and he's a nonexempt.  Uh, he doesn't know what he's going to
0 B:  So it's, I thought it was Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas or was that, uh,
0 A:  Sounds like you've been very fortunate.  I haven't had too many --
0 A:  -- terrible things happen to me, but my tee tops did get stolen one time
1 A:  -- it upset the neighbors in the apartment complex so I disabled it
1 B:  Yeah.
0 children in the home that find the guns, and, uh, you know, accidentally shoot
1 A:  A burglar comes in and, uh, finds a gun and ends up using it against the

0 hung them.
1 A:  Uh, I also grew up in, in a rural area, and my, a lot of my relatives are
1 just figuring that if anybody really wanted to break in, they would anyway,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 
0 B:  I says, think about what she would like to have.  Because a lot of them,
1 she's seventy-nine this year, uh, is living independently.  And she drives
1 say, if you just put them in the house and keep them there all day long, I
1 B:  They've got nothing.  Or they get on the telephone all day long. 
0 definitely something.  They could have a more automatic sentence instead of
0 B:  Oh, okay.  Because one of the things that I've heard so much about l-, um,
0 lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much.  And
0 B:  That's awful.  So one thing they could do is probably support people more
0 amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you
0 also pleased in it.  And, uh, I was, uh, greatly disappointed, uh, when I did
0 watch it.  He list-, like I say, if it's convenient he'll listen to it.

0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 B:  I do, you know, some minor stuff.  But I don't really like to do, uh, car
1 A:  Yeah, I'm afraid so,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  -- and come back. 
0 B:  Yeah, that's what I, I just did today.  I got, uh, DARKMAN.  Have you seen
0 that?
0 A:  # some, some of the, #
0 what the rule is now, but I think they had, I don't know if it's a year or what
1 A:  Yeah.  That was good.  Kevin Costner. 
1 about it. 
0 A:  Yeah.  Cliff hangers, and the next week you'd find out how he got out of

0 a mile is real.  And it may not even be a mile I'm running, it feels, it looks

1 A:  -- or even walk.
1 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  She doesn't like me on the telephone.  She's so jealous.
1 B:  Oh, okay [laughter].    
0 expenses, thank God, and so,
1 A:  ((Well)) it's time to go get your teeth cleaned again. 
0 a loan in a sense.
1 don't plan on, it's not something that you can,
1 A:  And, yeah, so, I'm very tight, you know, with my cash. 
0 B:  Oh. 
1 B:  #Well, that's all right#  too. 
1 B:  Yeah, well Purdue's been kind of out of it for a long time. 
0 A:  Right. 
1 B:  # a # lot of folks from Texas, uh, on this thing.  And so it's, it's, it's,
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 which is --
0 A:  Pretty much, yeah.  I, not in my own personal car.  I drive a lot in my,
0 know, she drives it to and from work.  It's --
1 A:  But it, it, it would seem to me as if I was sitting in a bullet --
0 A:  #Right.#  
0 straight.  So I just drove it to the Nissan place.
0 B:  I just think it should be harder for, for a criminal to get hold of them.
0 A:  I mean, #you can-,#
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  I don't know.  So if we're supposed to pick a number, I'd guess I'd pick,
0 number, really.
0 A:  #that he receives?#
1 B:  Um, but I'm not, I'm not real big on, that much on television.  Uh, I don't
1 B:  -- #know.# Uh, part of that I think is, uh, I have two boys, and, you know,
1 fairly, you know, sh-, you know, obviously there, she, you know, she, something
0 B:  #Right.# 
0 A:  # as # far as, uh, you know, what, what people are getting into.  But, uh,

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh {pause}. Yeah, I, um, I don't really, I pro-, [laughter] probably

1 B:  Oh, so it'll go up. 
1 A:  But I park for free up at, at Memorial Stadium because I know where I can
0 A:  And, um, I'm not going to be able to do that downtown [laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah.  We, you know, we, I like it there.  And I think Dallas has enough to
0 go traffic and everything. 
1 A:  Huh. 
0 guy's name.  It was like John Feinstein or something like that --
0 the news, and then I read the newspaper for a little more detail.
1 know, I'm reading [laughter] a three week old news #magazine.#
0 A:  #You know,# it's j-, it had been so long since there had been a,

0 can insulate the roots from freezing --
0 A:  -- don't go out there and start digging holes, uh,
0 if I look out my window right now, I can see, you know, couple of pine trees,
0 A:  -- that we use for, you know, uh, for eating --
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 themselves.
0 A:  You know, I, I, I think there's something about being able to, to claim,
0 A:  I was going to say, I'm not s-, I, I would guess that it's not that they
0 A:  And they need to have some competition. 
0 maybe five years and then go back.  And pick our brains, which is wonderful,
1 A:  -- that you can go and get cash on [laughter].
0 A:  -- that you can use in the, uh, impact machines or whatever, you,
1 B:  So I thought, man, I don't know if I trust this or not [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter]  Well, they, they do that a lot if you have good credit and you
1 B:  It's like, let's see if we can get her to run up her bills [laughter].
0 B:  Didn't pay them.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 interest rates.  I mean,
1 A:  That's true.

1 A:  To the top the of the peak, sure. 
0 A:  Oh, it's not bad at all.  It's, it's a beautiful drive. 
0 and I think we ate seafood every meal for, well, not quite every meal, but most

0 without going to gove-, to Congress,
1 A:  Oh, I, I would, uh, love to get into another conversation with you about

0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Right, I know, I'm doing.  The beat I'm covering now is about our landfill
0 A:  Um. 
0 A:  People don't want to wait. 
0 choices that we have here,

0 A:  Right, right. 
0 B:  Yeah, that is a big problem. 
0 B:  # for # everything,
0 B:  Right obviously, we're paying for the welfare state.  Now, as it turns out,
0 A:  And, right and so no matter what happens to me, if I get in a car accident
1 not a conservative in his fifties has no brain.  It was something like that
0 A:  Uh, commuting the sentences of those that were in, in jail for lesser

0 B:  All you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other.  And
0 have a credit card, because like, if my car would break down or something,
1 A:   Well, you're, you are so far ahead of me.  
1 A:   I make myself do it and if I do it, okay, I don't love it,
0 B:   That's right.  
0 fitness center, it's fenced in, and there's somebody in the

0 college you could take them, or if you didn't want to go to college you didn't
0 like that, you know, they had the placing, we're placing third or fourth, but
0 B:  #and I hope-,#
0 and,
0 A:  Right.

0 A:  That's like automobile insurance.  You never want to get in an accident
0 never would have able to pick up on his own.  He was very thankful for that,
0 B:  Well, doesn't it work, you don't see, uh, uh, anything until you spend the
0 you know, I was a solid weight trainer, 
0 B:   Uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot
1 just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like, you know,

1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 
1 A:  Like, like compost [laughter]. 
0 Texans.

1 terms of the, the economies of, of things, uh,
0 B:  Yeah, in my, my family, I know, most of us are southerners just happen to
0 uh, we, we, Congress got too much involved in, in trying to manage the war. 
1 A:  Oh, goodness.  
0 Spectrum that we bought new.  My daughter was a freshman in college when we
1 still could buy General Motors products and it was probably not that bad.
0 B:  Um.
1 that [laughter], that real people bought General Motors products,
0 B:  #but I absolutely loved that automobile.# And, you know, it wasn't that
0 can get a better negotiation on my own.  But, once, one thing that's a pain in

0 A:  # they # really did throw away a lot of money to get, getting one thing or
1 you want to go again,
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  It's, um, uh, I don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin but there's
0 nice, kind of like a travel guide --
0 B:  Yeah, in the middle, in the middle of the Summer. 
1 B:  Just walking that's all [laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.

0 has a tough gun law --  
0 B:  -- but he still had, not one but several -- 
0 A:  Exactly,  
0 B:  now I think there should be some sort of I D card that you carry.
0 A:  Uh. 
0 A:  Well, that's a lot of help.  
0 A:  -- I'm talking primarily about, uh, you know, the, the guys that are over
0 A:  There's a fear there too, I'm not really afraid of what might be happening
0 A:  fear's there. 
1 of two women, the secretary is a woman [laughter], 
1 to hurry up and get home, you know, I can't wait to get home so I can play with

1 A:  -- and neither can anybody else, you know [laughter], 
1 B:  they'll me too, and my family, they'll go oh, my God,
1 A:  Um, that's a good question.  Um,
0 A:  #Yeah.# 
0 B:  #They#  would pay for an alcohol --
0 A:  # th-, #
1 A:  -- give blood or something like that. 
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  the warranty wasn't on it or,
0 A:  # They never cut them off.  #
0 B:  #That's#  one thing.  Because I'm, I'm the same way.  We, I do own an
0 didn't have the, the type of family car I wanted.  But that car, I had for
0 thousand miles. 
0 low.  But, uh, I got a good price on it.  It's got good resale value and it
0 too late they do get the message.  And, I, I don't know, I think a lot of it
1 A:  Well I guess so. 
0 about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody,
1 B:  [Laughter]  Uh, maybe, I don't know,
1 B:  # I really # do, I, I, I sometimes think that a small company may offer
0 {pause}, well, I'm not sure how to pu-, [laughter], 
1 B:  So, I can see the results of that. 
1 an,
0 A:  You know, um, I think that, uh, whe-, when you're working and, an
0 A:  # Oh.  #
1 think it's a, I think it's a good idea.  I, I even think the random is fine,
1 the conversation a little more interesting because,
1 A:  since we both agree, it's kind of hard to,
0 A:  Is that how you got on the,
1 A:  Yeah [laughter]. 
0 B:  Talk to you.  Bye-bye. 
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, the thing I hate about them, I went through a divorce.
0 A:  #Because,# 
0 the, uh, sport again. 
0 that's, that's the primary reason that some of these older, that, you know,
1 you,
1 someone and yet have a basis for competitiveness such as, uh, ten cent,
1 right now and I'm watching a ball roll up about four inches from the hole
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 played and really enjoyed it,
0 B:  # even then # so.

0 Kuwaiti young won't rebuild anything.  They won't work.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Oh, you,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  They're just not selected somehow. 
0 and I don't think there are many women in the engineering college. 
1 B:  # Oh, uh-huh [laughter].  #
1 A:  # he's # been doing this evidently for a, a good number of years. 
1 A:  -- somebody to stay home that,
1 B:  I don't think there was a valid reason [laughter]. 
0 A:  I guess we can't win [laughter]. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  I was discriminated against very definitely in banking. 
1 A:  # part # of it since I didn't like it when, when I had to do it. 
0 A:  That's great. 
0 B:  I mean, he's just like in a world of his own, and yet he wants so much,
1 B:  As we walk through the, the lobby they'll all say, bring her here.  I want
0 B:  Yeah.  Um, let's see what was, {pause} uh, what about steaks?
0 A:  They've got a wait even on weeknights,
0 B:  It's pretty good and,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  The burrito you can only handle every so often. 
0 protective of them.
1 A:  um, they really want a dog badly, and they've been looking and looking
0 A:  I think that's really true.
0 of the road, you know,
0 incentive to get out of the drug trade.  And there was a lot of assassinations
0 doing that we should be doing.  Like right now, there's a big outbreak of, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.  The Marcos. 
0 on.  I mean, it's always been tough for the southern, lower latitude countries
1 A:  Or unless we're sending thousands of troops down to kick somebody's butt,
0 another, from their past history, formed into a larger country like our
0 about South America. 
0 some sort of a controversial thing going on that either affects me or the
1 A:  Well, right now we're we're having the little bit of Spring that we have. 
0 soil.  It's that black clay soil. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Does Dallas get high humidity? Or is it pretty dry. 
0 uh, gulf coast weather was like,
1 usually bother you very much. 
1 B:  So, they, the people I know that are from there, uh, they always miss it
1 [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Good luck to you. 
1 B:  But it's, uh, it's something as, you know, as I said won't go away, so it
0 I haven't been to Beirut or Syria or Baghdad,
0 A:  Okay, thank you. 
0 B:  Yeah.  That was really exciting.  It was fun. 
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
1 know, to our house. 
1 B:  And, uh, and, uh, help putty up the holes together and, and do things,
0 don't like also is the rooms are so small.  You know, it's very difficult to

1 B:  Huh-uh [laughter].  
0 B:  -- he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really.  He's, he's,
0 made me laugh.  Um, so anyway,
0 tried to read some things on it and I've tried to take some steps to, uh,
0 same thing to like your plants and you don't let them breathe, they kind of
1 pinpointing certain, you know, industries in our own communities that are, you
0 smoke in my house and I, I hope they respect that,
0 B:  and, you know, I, I send them outside [laughter],
1 your wishes and they don't just necessarily light up and, and, uh, you know,
1 you're going to do it, do it out there, and don't,
0 the sky was blue and the ocean was a pretty light blue, [laughter], you know,
0 B:  Gr-, I grew up in Chicago, so, yeah, you know, we had a lot of snow up
1 A:  # And, #
1 will get killed when you melt down plastic. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Right. 
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  # and your, # and your stock price will go down. 
0 A:  They're al-, there are already a few companies that had switched over from
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 and let things settle down, maybe we could figure out what, in fact, we need
1 B:  # Yeah it's been good.  #
0 there but I also have two sons living elsewhere,
0 A:  Yeah, that's a, that's,
0 the abortion issue with the right to life and right to choose and,
0 A:  That's very bad, yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  # they # won't do that, they'll never pass it that will be like,
0 A:  # Right.  #
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 your own design of,
1 don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're JORDACHE new
0 or whether they're [laughter],
1 A:  And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need
1 to cut down somewhat on your [laughter]  friends. 
1 A:  where there's a will, there's a way, right? [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Well, actually it's expanded your field too, because the psychology of, of
0 information, Ken, this first, uh, first computer had one, had two
1 B:  Right. 
0 A:  Uh, I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi-,
0 B:  # Everybody, everybody is.  #
1 B:  So would I [laughter]. 
1 your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight. 
0 B:  My word. 
1 B:  Oh, my.  Well, what a wonderful thing. 
0 B:  I don't know, maybe this climate is a little better. 
0 B:  Oh, in between the ((size wise)) yeah,
1 B:  Well, my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them
0 B:  # Oh, of course.  #
0 A:  No. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Yeah, yeah. 
0 once you get hooked, you know, you can really get, uh, locked up in that stuff
0 going to go pro football.  Uh, I'm not good enough.  I faced the, you know,
0 B:  We need to have you in our high school [laughter]. 
0 should have, what are they going to do.
1 A:  [Laughter]  Are you, uh, have you made any money off your hobby?
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Oh. 
1 B:  All that, so there's a lot of things like that, that Texas Instruments
0 was mainly, uh, associated with metals and sensors which is mainly what our
0 which is,
1 chess club at Texas Instruments and, uh, we actually had a grand master in the
0 A:  Expert. 
1 the more you're going to pay. 
1 A:  If I had any children I would, uh, I hope that I'll be in a position to
0 him. 
1 B:  it's fun. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  But, uh, uh, so I enjoy it but,
1 B:  Oh, yeah. 
1 B:  Yeah [laughter]. 
1 B:  Oh, I'm an interior design major, [laughter]. 
1 A:  aerobic instructor type field.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  I don't consider it fun doing that, but.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Um,
0 more, um, women choosing to not work after they have a baby. 
0 B:  Yeah, believe it or not though the, all the women that stay home are real
1 while and they come back, and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  Right. 
1 was asking for it but him.
1 B:  [Laughter]  I don't know th-, he, it, looked, ((can)) look good on his re-,
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah, my favorite,
0 they don't talk about it logically it's always, always, uh, the, the only thing
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 intense.  It was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book but it was ar-, it was
1 A:  Sometimes. 
0 A:  Uh, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Ther-, there's a lot of work to be done.  
0 A:  There's Aid to Dependent Children, and Aid to Mothers of Dependent
0 B:  Oh, okay.  So, start (( )).
0 A:  We also need to, uh, assure that there's some work in the private sector. 
0 A:  So, if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum
0 sort of like selective approval.  Almost like the United Way campaign where
0 accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip.  So, that's what I meant
1 B:  # I, I've got a big # hang-up with that. 
0 A:  And they,
0 B:  I think compared to the other systems that are out there, without a doubt
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Not real protective but, uh, well, I, I guess that's about [laughter], to
1 up paying.  I was, I was better off paying a state tax mo-, back in Maryland,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 things I heard proposed on, uh, one of the public radio stations up here was
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  And, uh, God, if your child is not an honor student, well then,
0 know, long time, uh.
1 B:  Right.  Yeah, I'm always waiting for something to go on it, but.
0 out and buying a new one.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Hey listen for sixteen hundred dollars, you just save that and put it in
1 the bank, you'd get new carpet in a couple of years [laughter].
1 one then they have to call you [laughter].
0 A:  I think that's about the last time, well that was a gift to me, so I guess
0 B:  # Oh, no.  #
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  Oh, wow.  That's great. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 but a lot of people, you know, go in the hole and, uh, take, you know, weeks
1 A:  # I # just go in debt for vacation [laughter], 
0 B:  Do you have ((flexible)) benefits where you can get, sort of like pick and
0 A:  you know, everything goes on American Express,
0 A:  and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping.  
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 I've got three card offers now,
0 about fell over.
0 A:  They're good cars. 
0 and [breathing] a lot of the car companies now are beginning to scale up,
0 I've, like I say, I've had absolutely nothing wrong with it other than taking
0 B:  # you # know, you're not sure what you're going to get when you change. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  it's, it's a bother to have to pick somebody up and if you have a
0 B:  in a major city?  
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  you know, uh, you know, get, find another way instead of,  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  you know, I'm sure some,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 was just, uh, really an easy adjustment for most people, but there was a small
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  if you want to send like, you know, fifty cents a day,  
0 B:  and I have seen a town change from a town to a city and its,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But today, I mean, you know, it's like you wouldn't even think of doing
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  It very definitely is.
0 B:  on a certain income no matter what it is,
0 happens between a mother and a child.
1 yourself?
0 A:  [Throat_clearing]  Um, {pause} it's been probably three or four years since
1 B:  You think he's pretty good?
1 B:  -- so I'm hoping he's going to blossom and make me a rich man someday. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  and, you know, he played for so many, so well for so many years that,
0 B:  -- #so it's# kind of interesting.  Yeah, I usually get home and pick up the

1 was a raccoon that came into our campsite and stole some of the food, you know,
0 B:  And cover his ears.
1 were in bed and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the
0 A:  but even when he went, when he had an accident or something, uh, if you
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, sometimes, you know, the, the time consuming stuff can be the worst
0 A:  I usually marinate them for overnight or something like that so that, uh,
0 A:  Well, you can just take, you know, that little, uh, spoon or whatever and
0 make, it doesn't take a whole lot.
1 A:  Yes [laughter]. 
1 I found out that that's probably the worst color I can wear. 
0 B:  # color, you # know, and, and in those shades. 
0 A:  Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  # and # that's certainly communism as far as I can tell. 
0 A:  Oh well, so that's, uh, what, what's going to be real interesting is if
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  [Sigh] And I don't know that there is a good situation entirely, but
0 B:  uh-huh, I was talking to a friend in Irving who sits on a parents
0 B:  And I found the cheapest thing I could find that I could help her with
0 in more than one area,
0 A:  # it was in a # mess,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, and it's, it's just been lovingly restored. 
1 B:  Uh-huh, so how many miles does it have on it. 
0 A:  Is it the same engine that's been in it all the time. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 coming in the future. 
0 @A:  [Beep]  Okay, um, I.

0 A:  # Uh-huh, exactly.  #
1 probably won-, [laughter].
0 unique. 
1 B:  I've read a couple of his things, I, I just wasn't that crazy about him. 
0 A:  Um, but other than that, um, [clicking]  I've read DUNE, I don't know if
1 A:  Huh, that's interesting. 
1 academic reading I do as a matter of course. 
0 subject I think in the Spring everybody decides that they're going to start
1 A:  Uh, yeah, it's been an experience [laughter]. 
1 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # And, # uh, just trying to get them to do what they say they're going to
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 whereas this stuff is clear,
0 B:  # but, #
0 A:  The only they think I've heard of them doing down here in Dennison is
0 B:  I just try to reuse mine a lot at home too and, but used to, you know, if I
0 came along and I used them some with him most of the time I think I used them
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  # three # dollars worth of tissue you in a morning, you know. 
0 question about it.  Well, I just, you know, I'm really glad to see us a world,
1 little boys.  one's about, uh, uh, almost five and the other's almost three. 
0 my middle daughter is interested in day care, uh, has been since she was in
0 you know, able to do that.  I think sometimes people take on, I know I have
0 now with young kids, but if I was working full-time and had to give up a
0 B:  # Huh-uh.  #
0 A:  There's a lot to consider. 
0 B:  like that.  Uh, by that name. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 And, and, you know, multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the
1 A:  Huh-uh. 
1 B:  Oh, yeah. 
1 B:  Oh, you don't know what happens after they get in school. 
0 A:  [Laughter]  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  We, we're having such fun, my wife and I were both only children. 
1 B:  Wrong. 
0 the kids and things like that, I guess. 
0 get a home and buy house, (( )) and these days you see a lot of people living
0 A:  # Is that what it was? #
0 B:  But, yeah, I think it's their way of saying how well you do,
1 A:  I never thought about that, that makes me feel a little better [laughter]. 
1 toast any way so,
0 B:  # We went there on my birthday # in March it's great. 
1 B:  too much like a bar naturally,

1 A:  # because I # went there many times and,
0 B:  The Washington riots weren't because I lived right downtown,
1 B:  # Washington and, # uh, [laughter]  and what you saw is was what you got
0 children coming from their parents, um, children who will lie and cheat and you
0 B:  # uh, # people working on the family farm which was a traditional American

1 B:  He, he just, thro-, takes stuff he says, yeah about an ounce of this
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  Thank you.  Sorry about that. 
1 B:  But, uh, that was, that's the extent of which I guess that's more than,
0 A:  students could watch that and, uh, criticize the methods used and, and
1 A:  [Laughter] You sound like one of my best friends, 
0 B:  Yeah, hey,  
1 A:  Okay.   
0 A:  Right, right.   
0 A:  Unlike this war that we just got out of here.   
0 B:  So do I.   
1 A:  [Laughter] We all got together and watched the,  
1 A:  Yeah, it really, 
1 B:  Oh well, go out with a whimper.   
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Didn't, didn't know if they had cable in Waco.

1 B:  I've been here three years. 
1 B:  You aren't missing anything [laughter]. 
0 A:  That's kind of what I've heard [laughter]. 
0 uh, uh, I, I felt like they ought to cut the capital gains tax.
0 A:  Sure. 
0 B:  That's right. 
0 B:  Okay, well see, the pressure's more up here so it hasn't dropped quite as
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # the, the huge one.  Yeah, instead # of wallpaper.  I wouldn't mind it if
0 B:  Um. 
0 B:  Pardon. 
0 B:  # I # mean, he, he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around

0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  So, uh,
0 B:  # and # that's, that's, you know, that's my main objection.  I, you know, I
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 will respond to that group that does want it. 
0 B:  So, you know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Bye-bye. 
1 B:  Yeah, I'm just a --
1 A:  I passed [laughter] the fifty.

0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Well that depends on what day of the month it is. 
0 B:  Are, are you married?
0 B:  # I # could possibly do it and, and that has a lot to do with his strength
0 A:  The best you can, yeah. 
0 the, it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there. 
1 B:  Yeah [laughter]. 
0 B:  # Seems like it can't get much worse.  #
0 A:  -- I sure wouldn't have been able to predict for him. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  And, uh, both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school
0 twenty bucks for real quick.
0 A:  And, uh, not necessarily, you know, give in to their, uh, human rights
0 A:  But, uh, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes
0 A:  and car theft on top of it,

0 A:  Oh.  Was that local or, uh,
0 mine a couple of years ago.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- I, uh, basically was, you know, it was where I was at the time.

1 would have been different.  But,
1 not gave him half the stuff he's got.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  And then United States is not going to use them.  Yeah, right,
0 B:  So, you know, it's like, what do you want to do first.

0 A:  (( )). 
0 if you have, uh, watched it on T V.
0 A:  Both.
0 B:  I see.
1 and someday, maybe, we might even own it, but, um, for all practical purposes,
0 B:  so that implies ownership.
0 A:  Oh, ok, yeah.
1 A:  It sounded good to me [laughter].
1 Who sold it to a couple who had [sigh] no idea that homes ever needed upkeep.
0 A:  [Laughter] Oh, no.
0 A:  Um, [noise] the ones that look like brick houses [laughter]?
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Any yet, you know, they, they show very well un-, they show very well
0 nursing home here in Plano that, that has, uh, activities going all the time
0 that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.  It's
0 B:  a good home.
1 A:  And, and, uh, at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in.  And
1 B:  Oh wow.
1 A:  Read a-, [laughter] read those cartoons in the NEW YORKER,
1 A:  Really, and GOLF DIGEST (( )) [laughter].
1 A:  That's right, people can get them and their children do craft projects.
0 B:  [Laughter]  Oh, that would be awful.
1 A:  ((I have)) to change doctors.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Okay.
1 parents were really avid campers as well.  So I guess we just kind of came by

1 B:  Absolutely.  
1 B:  tennis lessons.
0 B:  when she was in her late eighties,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 there quite a long time.
1 B:  Uh, the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff
0 she'd written this book, so we all had to read it for a sociology class.
1 B:  a number of history books, but I haven't read any yet.
0 A:  Oh, that's fun.
0 B:  Yeah, there's a series, well, it was a trilogy with four books [laughter].
0 A:  {Faint} Oh.
1 A:  {Faint} I'll have to,
0 back.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 about a squid.
0 know, find himself and allow himself to get into that situation.

1 A:  Um, is there anything,
1 B:  That's right, that's right.  
1 A:  Uh-huh, sure.
0 problems and, and I think that they'll grad-, they'll work towards solving
0 A:  You know, because, uh, thoughts are,
0 B:  and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more, and then
0 A:  Okay. 
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  I know.  
1 A:  -- to interest.  
0 B:  -- you know, and, and so that, that is the smart half.  
0 expression there, but, uh,
1 I could carry around a little conversion card or something and,
0 A:  ((But yeah)) right [laughter].
1 B:  to hold it up.  
0 A:  It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think,
1 I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current

0 A:  So, I consider them my pets, too [laughter].

0 B:  They have the standard and the giant.
1 B:  It, oh listen, I raised three of them.
0 A:  because you'll get better grades.  I, I think most employers would
0 B:  I was trying to ((choose)).  You know, a particular institution might be
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  Does it?  Yeah, I've been trying to, you know, do that, and, and sometimes
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  # I don't # know if I want to take that responsibility or not, but
0 B:  Wow, that's rough.

1 B:  Boy, you really lift me up to a different,
1 B:  # I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire.# 
1 B:  Well, it might be a good time for you to be-, to, to start a tradition. 
0 B:  Well, in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual --
0 A:  Okay.  Do you have relatives in Vernon --
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  it was quite popular.  Um, you don't play, um, an instrument so,
1 B:  No.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  That, I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who
0 would go into his,
0 B:  There's, you know, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really
1 B:  That's good.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  That often is the case, um, the, you know, it's, it, sometimes
0 B:  And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River, and they also, uh, uh, have
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place and
1 But it was,
1 B:  What did you wind up with? [laughter].
0 B:  You do the same.
0 not going to be there?
1 A:  Anyway [laughter],
1 A:  [Laughter] or something like that, and they all go out and howl, you know
1 A:  We've wound up sending in one.  That's something I didn't think that we'd
1 open, hoping it would ((fall out)), because he wouldn't let anybody pull it.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Well, you know,
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- I think they give me a hard time, but I think they know that that's,
0 A:  it's the right way [laughter].
0 B:  But,
0 B:  like we do here.
0 A:  for the most part.  And, uh,
1 word, he, he, he's chomping at the bit.
1 A:  Yeah.  Uh, I tend, when, when I spend enough money to go overseas
1 B:  because you could cancel mine too.
0 A:  victims, yes.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- election.
0 A:  Oh, really --
1 that I buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries
1 [laughter].
0 B:  And see,
0 A:  -- you know, in terms of how,
1 A:  I thought, Golly, you're seven years old and you're already opinionated
0 B:  -- and so forth, so, that's a whole another story.
1 [laughter].
0 B:  -- and so forth, and so, they, they shared some of the ideas they, their
0 companies were, had, uh, instituted as far as, uh, giving a leg up, mentoring
1 little niece gets up there she can [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And so, it, you know, it seems,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 something not on sale, because I've already gotten it on sale --
0 B:  They're going to, they're building a new one that's going to be even
1 to use the credit cards, because that just runs,
1 B:  I, uh, having a garage sale yourself, helps [laughter].  We just had one
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Right.  So you look at it more as a task.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  You know, I'll tell you, the sit ups and push ups are excellent --
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  #I don't know,#
0 eat them plain --
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, so we bought that or we bought the, the filets, and then the
1 that's turkey, too.  It costs less than the other, I don't know, there's
1 A:  Less cho-, less cholesterol.
1 B:  Yeah, I, I can't think of any other specific things I like to serve.  Um,
1 A:  Never get them at both places,
0 B:  -- grandkids, and we're kind of off on the sidelines.  But it does remind
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah, my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia, and I
1 A:  [Laughter] I don't really care for her to be president again.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school, I mean,
0 high school.  They're even in grade school when they do that.  But I can't
1 B:  Right, I, I just have mine all written up.  If I didn't have any of those,

0 not after the consumer, they're after the builder, they're protecting the

0 A:  Oh, my goodness.
0 B:  That's right, once they get up in sch-,
0 one do we really own.  Um.
0 B:  Where are you, and, uh,
1 A:  Uh-huh.  So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal
0 B:  Yeah, and you can do a l-, it makes things very convenient.  You can save a
0 with my job.  I've been through three classes --
0 B:  Um, I haven't done much [baby_crying] word processing work with my job.  I
0 taste.
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  They have the same kind of station down here, and when I
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh, my gosh.
0 A:  I pretty, I'll listen to anything basically, except I don't like the real
0 B:  Yeah, I, I especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause
0 A:  I mean maybe it's, uh,
1 B:  Right.
0 people, 
0 B:  -- and the city workers, uh, took them to court to protest, saying that it
0 A:  -- I think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything, and,
0 A:  Yeah, and it's so expensive --
0 B:  -- that's the way it was.
0 B:  Did you see DANCES WITH WOLV-, DANCES?
0 have been GHOST --
1 syndrome where they think that their prince is going to come and solve all
1 their problems [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter]  That doesn't happen [laughter].
1 A:  No, I wouldn't go see that if I had to, I don't think.  I'd have nightmares
1 A:  So I guess I'll have to eventually get to that one.
0 B:  -- I've got all the old musicals, like OKLAHOMA --
0 B:  Oh, my gosh,
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Well, that's okay.
1 A:  -- but you can fast forward through those [laughter].
1 B:  But, uh, just, you know, like, about like the government runs.
0 B:  but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi-, I could not believe he

0 B:  she is like, on the verge of it or,
0 A:  Yes, they are.
1 B:  I, I would much rather that, do that,
0 all that, and, uh, I think it's going to cost us, per couple, about three
1 six o'clock, uh, fight getting the news,
1 A:  -- I thought, you know, pick up some interesting facts.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 I think the quality of T V has gone down or else my interests have changed,
1 A:  Right.  Right.
0 and, uh, I thought that was surprising being a new show and I'm sure it cost a

0 B:  #Since# you aren't making it, we're going to find somebody else.
0 particular business I'm in, I'm not a lawyer,
1 A:  Right.  Right.  Well, same here, usually it's already by the time we get
0 A:  #I mean I,# I just can't. I, you know, I served on a jury for a lady that
1 A:  I was going to say do you have daughters.  That's always a good question.

1 B:  Good.
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.

1 A:  you know [laughter].
1 A:  [/Laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Right.
0 B:  I think it does when, when they are real little and they are changing every
0 A:  Yeah,
0 B:  But that's unusual.
0 lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families.
0 decisions but we have not.  So, I, I can see a lot of friends here in the
0 a much more pleasant, more caring, uh, situation to be in the home of one of

1 B:  Oh, that would be great.
0 A:  Oh, yeah {sounds like a loss of words here}.  ((Do you have)) your own ski

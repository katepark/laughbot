0 A:  Hi.
0 what do you normally, what type of outfit do you normally have to wear?
0 A:  Right.
1 but, 
0 B:  [Laughter] I guess that would have to do with the weather.
0 engineering, and,
0 A:  sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and would want to
0 desk all day and nobody could see you,
0 B:  Yeah, or, uh-huh.
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  weather, you know,
0 B:  But then usually in the summer, it's cold in the offices because the air
0 A:  Right, right. #What time of, what time of the year.#
0 B:  But, I'm not in that professional of a position, so,
0 A:  Okay, and, and --
0 B:  you know, what I feel a, comfortable in.  
0 about, uh, about --
0 herself anymore, was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Uh-huh  
0 B:  my mother, excuse me.  Go ahead.  
0 that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make
0 A:  of the decision making, you know, 
0 A:  I know.  They, and, well, they had, well, they had, they had seen it
0 something like that were to happen that my children would do something like,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Absolutely.  Unfortunately, a lot of times it, responsibilities
0 B:  And, uh, it's usually not a very smooth,  
0 B:  Right. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 elderly, you know, in several, in a,
0 B:  in a whole lot of areas. 
0 B:  Just people are, of course, populations getting older. 
0 A:  Yeah.  You know it's, it's interesting that, that a lot, the population of
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  extended family -- 
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I, I think that perhaps, perhaps the extended family, you
0 A:  You know I mean, of course there, there comes other issues, you know,
0 B:  [Laughter] Yes, 
0 A:  I mean they raised us after all. 
0 A:  Yeah.  But, uh, I, I, I think that, you know, we always, uh, I mean, I've,
0 environment and --
0 B:  -- or some priorities anyway. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air
0 atmosphere around us.
0 A:  Um, does your work entitle, uh, anything of environmental along these
0 know, a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.  And that we
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  are very, um, aware of the opacity, which is the thickness of a stack
0 very closely, uh, it becomes a real issue, especially, when it's smoking and
0 you have to get it fixed el pronto.
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  So it's a full time, uh, everybody has their home phone number type of job.
0 Sherman City Council with, um,
0 A:  funds right now as I understand it.  Uh, but it's, uh, it's something
0 ground.  Because eventually, you know, it, it seems that no matter what they
1 A:  Yeah.  I'm familiar with that one.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  -- and actually, um, potash, per se, and concrete and then actually put it
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  It was totally legal.  But the cost of doing this is astronomical,
0 B:  Um,
0 very, very, uh, cognizance of, and aware of all these types of, uh,
0 A:  See you later.  Bye-bye.
0 A:  Yeah, I, I, I think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders.  But
0 place of Freon, though?
0 so.
0 B:  Be it electrical, as in your home refrigerator.  Or propane, as the one on
0 the ship that you said --
0 B:  -- uh, you had.  And, uh, somehow, cr-, heat must be created that Freon,
0 A:  sure.  Yeah, yeah, I,   
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  When I was a kid I used to do the same thing.
0 And I just have a feeling, that, you know, that's our, that's our air
1 town is going down watching the traffic light change.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah. 
0 B:  He said, now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests, but,
1 unfortunately we're out of it right now.  But, as,
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  And it, they got their water from this, uh, beautiful mountain river.
0 country.  [sniffing] And they s-, yeah, it's getting better, it's getting
0 better.  And then you turn around and you look and places like Los Angeles,
0 more.
0 B:  And yet, they haven't done a thing to them.  
0 w-,
0 B:  Well, they, um, I, I had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up
0 on me [/static],
0 [throat_clearing] what more can we do to cars to make them less
0 A:  do whatever I want to do with the kids, then whenever I have a meeting
0 Um, you see people wearing, you know, all different attire.  I, um, don't like
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  [Throat_clearing]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Well like, when fam-, when my family camps, we're, the only time you're at
0 National Parks and stuff [sniffing].  We camped at the, let's see, we camped
0 and it was just horrible, and the sand was blowing up our camp,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  when I was, when we were camping so extensively, when we were younger.
0 I've got a child and another one on the way, so I,
0 A:  Um, um.  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Hi, Archie.  I'm Sharon.
0 critics initially said that, you know, it wouldn't go anywhere, that it was
0 B:  Y-, you have to go see that one.  And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB?
0 A:  That's, [laughter] that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that
0 somebody said, did you notice that?
0 B:  Yeah, real scruffy looking [laughter].
0 [laughter] playing in the movie.  But I thought, it's good that, you know, it
0 was a lot of fun.
0 B:  It used to,
0 A:  That's right [laughter].
0 I realized, no, I, I really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so,
0 B:  that was almost an example of s-, an invasion that turns out to be not
0 phone even with the machine.  I find people being kind of polite and waiting
0 for it to finish what it has to say, and then they feel an obligation to
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And I don't think I would have thought about that.  I think that's a good
0 things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it,
0 B:  if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something
0 B:  I don't,
0 from that.
0 B:  And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had
0 B:  that, that I would have thought to be private.  But then if it turns out
0 to generate incorrect things, that's even worse so,
0 money and then all of,
0 A:  Yeah.  And, um, one of the problems with the Lotus data base was, um, that
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  but just says a word for loneliness.  Loneliness is the closest you can
0 A:  You know, it very much is.  But on the other hand, I realized I could go
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in the
0 because I have to really tell someone to go away. And there's that sense of, I
0 A:  Arch, how are you doing tonight? 
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  Fine.  Kind of tired. 
0 anything about how they propose to, uh, come up with the taxes to increase the
0 houses,
0 A:  We're not funding our schools like other states either.
0 A:  that's an idea. 
1 uh, those that are economically disadvantage won't have the ability to make a
0 choice [laughter].
0 B:  Yes. 
0 real bad mess because there's people on every side of the problem.
0 A:  But that's not a bad one. 
0 income tax, I'd, uh, have a very hard time financing my house again.  You
0 B:  Um, I'm surprised that m-, uh, my income taxes are as low as they are.  We
0 this year which is, which is nicer than having to pay out, uh, which is a
0 do you think about them, let's see, state?
0 A:  And the city tax, the sale tax.  They used to, you really didn't even think
0 A:  I'm glad I don't work in a store. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 not making that much money.  They're making probably more like five or six,
0 A:  Lots and lots of people. 
0 fairly nice.  Not like you would think a, a poor person would be.
0 dollar in my wallet, it's like, boy, where do I gr-, where do I find that?
0 A:  Yeah.  And you give them, you know, they get their free lunch and they
0 A:  That he,
0 A:  How do you feel about gun control?
0 @B:  Uh, on the scale they gave, one to ten, I'd say I'm probably a four.  I'm
0 A:  Some people do, I know.
0 B:  No, they don't, they don't ask anything except how old you are, I don't
0 B:  Yeah, they might be, you know how we are here in Texas, it's like
0 A:  [Laughter]  Yeah, it's, it's a hard decision to make.
0 A:  Right.
0 it.
0 with a lot of people that hunt, and they just, they, they don't see any sense
0 B:  Well, yeah that's true.  [laughter]  #They shoot each other thinking
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 back.
0 B:  Yes, yes. Is, is that one that you're talking about. 
0 wall.
0 think it's great, that you know, freedom of speech in this country and
0 uh, gosh it was about nine o'clock at night, too.  It wasn't even what I would
0 I don't particularly care for it, so I especially don't like for them to come
0 otherwise, I don't want to know they exist.
0 get me to join or, you know, become interested in their religion, because I
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh gosh.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 coming and soliciting and selling things at the door.  You said something
0 uh, people coming to you at the front door.
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh goodness, okay, is our five minutes up?
0 A:  Well I've enjoyed talking with you. 
0 B:  Well it was nice talking to you too Jim.
0 A:  -- after being in school and so, we're just first time homeowners.  We've
0 went to school at Rice and got his P h d. so that, that's what brought
0 impression that it was out of our price range.
0 yesterday, or uh, you know, over the last couple of days and they have
0 sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one, you know, that
0 foundation problems.  That seems to be the, pretty much the rule out here.
0 things (( )).
0 A:  Well, since like I say, we're first time homeowners, I'm still
0 A:  and we didn't know, uh, you know, if we were afraid, that we'd be
0 know, that run through the foundation,
0 more, uh, more stable and, and puts more strength into it.
0 B:  So, uh, you know, it [clicking], it, uh, potentially that's
0 that we bought, 
0 A:  Well, thank you.
0 B:  Hi.
0 A:  I think there really is.
0 @B:  Okay.
0 A:  It really is.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yeah, I kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social
0 A:  Oh, I do, 
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah we get the full benefits.
0 know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  That's been real helpful too, like my doctor stays open til nine in the
0 I've done that to do something,
0 B:  But I know,
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 least the wheels are moving forward.
0 had dogs in the past and, uh, it seems, it seems to, uh, respond real well,
0 A:  and, uh, I live in motor home, by the way, I'm, uh, an R V, full time R V
0 B:  Really.
0 A:  And I feed her indoors, that's to lure her in, but during the day I have
0 A:  running from one stake to another, and then attached to that is a, uh,
0 B:  Most definitely.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh, oh well.
0 music do you like?
0 A:  Well, I mostly listen to popular music.  I, uh, listen to it all the time
0 A:  uh, I find myself listening to popular music, and, uh, quite honestly, I,
0 laughing}, experience to share [laughter].
0 B:  I, I do, I do listen to a lot of, you know, I do, I switch the stations a
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 thing I do object to about rap music is, is when it becomes militant,
0 B:  I heard what was called talking blues,
0 B:  And, um, you, you listen a lot, if you, if you hear a lot of old gospel,
0 so much different and yet, I, I have a much younger sister who listens to a
0 the words to songs that she's listening to, and yet,
0 A:  from him to use it.  And, he, he since then has, has amended that, and
0 oh, that was really great.  That was a, you know, a really good piece of work,
0 good stage performer.
0 B:  but, but I've really, I, I loved, I mean, I was, I was really into the
0 music.  Um, the album oriented like the, uh, James Taylor,
1 B:  Yeah, you just sort of, you know, well I guess I can just humor them, you
0 B:  Yeah, but well, you know, I, I, I've liked a lot of the new music.  I
0 think, um,
0 when it, when it came out, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  No.
0 and then taking those, those qualities, and then applying, in the styles, that
0 B:  Yeah, I, I listened and, I heard, you know, you hear this guitar, and then
0 A:  Is it, is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well?
0 you're not, you know, you don't feel it so strapped.
0 can't pay off by the end of the month.
0 A:  and said we're going to pay off all of our credit cards and, uh,
0 A:  That's good to be in that kind of shape.
0 account with T I where they, we put in so much a month, and then they, or so
0 figure, to, put it, we're putting it in C D's right now,
0 A:  and then gave us a good idea back, you know, some good information back
0 A:  and, or not, and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and
0 A:  Okay, I guess that's most of my, um, financial plans right now.
0 ===========================================================================
0 A:  Well no, he doesn't have that trouble.  He, uh, has this little slip that
0 B:  Oh that's the best way ((it's used)), [laughter] that's the best way, yes.
0 know how much they pay for it.
0 B:  Oh, I have to open it, you know, they, mine always charges the flowers so I
0 B:  Oh, those are fun.
0 A:  Oh, no, I never thought of it that way either.  He's, you know, he's
0 B:  Oh, it's, it's real easy to get addicted to them, you know, you get out on
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, well I've been asking my husband for the credit cards.  I've got all
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 least amount of the, uh, uh, what you call it.
0 amount.
0 B:  Yes, uh-huh.
0 A:  I have to think of something else, I'm,
0 A:  Well six minutes, I've got a timer on my, uh, clock, on my phone.
0 A:  Well I, I don't know, I don't know how far it goes.  Are you in Texas?
0 A:  or, Denison, rather.
0 A:  This is my first one too.
0 birthdays.
1 uh, you know, I think even one time we used it to pay our rent.
0 A:  He just popped out that, uh, MasterCard and,
0 B:  Get that cash advance, uh-huh [laughter].
0 out and you can, uh, set up little trips and day trips and things.  It's
0 pretty, pretty neat. [talking] {background} Um, oh, I like photography,
1 B:  Um, well I hate to, yes, I do [laughter].
0 B:  Uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer
0 big, okay.
0 SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW.
0 And the very last chapter, and I haven't figured out why that one was last, is
0 difficult to, to know if it's, you know, I think if somebody would say hey,
0 read these ten books because these are self-improvements, I would probably be
0 turned off to them.
0 interesting and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the
0 A:  Oh, yeah, you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other
0 A:  I think sometimes the word is a little over used but,
0 A:  All right, I think we know what we're going to speak about.
0 B:  Okay, you go ahead.
0 B:  In public places.
0 A:  in public places.  There is one state that does that, by the way.
0 V -s and sixty dol-, sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a, on
0 dollars a year to keep some, you know, joker in there for life.  We could
0 there, with sixty percent of the people, uh, seventy percent of the people
0 A:  Exactly.
0 that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries are for is to make
0 B:  Well if I, I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I believe from
0 the flip side, and have some judge that was paid off or, you know, had go-, a
0 through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they
0 a list [laughter] are the ones that are on the jury and that's it.
0 his peers or something, yeah.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 want to ((smush)) their creativity, you know.  We want to go ahead and let
0 B:  Well, I'm kind of that way too.  I work in the legal department and where
0 heck of a lot of boxes of documents.
0 A:  and it's just (( )), it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and
0 fan at the very end of the row and that was it.  And so, we didn't really know
0 B:  And the supervisor from another area came up to us and, you know, this
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah.
0 wide full ones, you know, and becau-, these weren't even those.  These were
0 B:  Um.
0 B:  Um.
0 B:  And, and a particular kind of shoe, you know, so high heel, oh it is
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way.
1 say I'm nuts, but I am more productive when I'm in pants.
0 A:  You can't do that in a skirt [laughter] poor soul.
0 A:  Oh yuck.
0 mean it was just completely miserable for her.
0 A:  Really, wow.
0 then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt.
0 B:  #Okay, bye.#
0 B:  We have had highs of seventy-two, lows in the twenties.
0 I think right now it's like sixty-nine,
0 ground being dry, but I guess it also, uh, brings about allergies, we're
0 having a lot of allergies down here right now.
0 and if you look outside, you would like to go out and mow your lawn,  
0 A:  No snow?
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  So, uh, in that regard, it's fine, but, uh, 
0 hour.
0 A:  And, I had to always, I've lived there for eight years myself.  I'd
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Well, I worked for the government, so I, I moved, uh, much more frequently
0 reasonable lengthy conversation.  Uh, do you work for Texas Instruments? 
0 B:  No, I do not.  I work for G T E.
0 Jack.
0 monitor, um, [static] anything that comes out of a stack, or out of a
0 work place and we take care of that, but (( )),
0 uh, concerning recycling [static],
0 rather listen, you know, I listen to heavy metal or classic rock.
1 A:  well, they're like, for example, A C D C.
0 D C's okay.
0 A:  and they just bump into each other,
0 the words heavy metal and, like, you always thought about, like, suicide.  And
0 B:  Well sure, because Queen was real popular when I was growing up.
0 A:  Well, for example, I used to like old Phil Collins.
0 money, a lot of money doing this, and then he came out with, uh, see, for
0 B:  Yeah.
0 seen it yet?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 got a lot to say.
0 I was like,
0 B:  That's true.  But, I was more in the late seven-, well, I shou-, like mid
0 B:  and, seventy-nine, was more my era.
0 A:  Okay.
0 heavy, you know, and real, um,
0 B:  So, so that's what I mean, disco wasn't really my time.
0 the, or, you know, like the technology years,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  because of all the computers and stuff.  But the seventies got nothing.
0 A:  So.
0 we're going to go from the, from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first
0 Don't worry, don't worry, you're not, you're not missing anything, you know,
1 so,
0 A:  that's why I guess, everybody, yeah, it's like they don't want to talk
0 B:  Uh, yeah. 
0 A:  #that bad.  Bye, bye.#
0 B:  No, I don't.
0 things like that an.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 to our children except for we might go out, you know, one evening or
0 A: Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, so.
0 weeks ago and, uh, [throat_clearing].
0 B:  Uh-huh, the kids thought that was wonderful.
0 B:  I, is, I'm not sure which one we went into, it was about a year or so ago,
0 B:  Yeah, yeah they had a lot of fun in there and, uh, there's, uh, there's
0 A:  And, and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting,
0 B:  Yeah.  I, we try to do a lot of things as a family and, you know,
0 sure that will be good.
0 B:  and got transferred to Colorado where I was living.  Uh, and, he had
0 B:  And, uh, it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn't
0 A:  Oh, its, I think, I think everything always sounds more glamorous than it
0 B:  Right.
0 they, should they become a state?
0 B:  that they don't seem, um, upset about it or anything and I think it would
0 be able to, uh, be arranged better, I don't know.
0 A:  Well, where, where are we going to get another state.
0 B:  Yeah, it's definitely a way out of the way, where Pu-, where as,
1 [laughter].
0 B:  I don't know if that's, uh, if that's true about all Puerto Ricans or not,
0 A:  No, I have no idea, but, uh, so you think that mostly they're, they're
0 B:  Okay, I guess we're on.
0 A:  Uh, realistically, I, yes, I don't see the, the Panama Canal that hasn't
0 had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not, not really big
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 don't realize how small the canal is.  Have you ever been there? 
0 we're in a situation where the United States is, looks like we're it now.
0 if you're looking at the, at the, at the peasant, uh, whether he's in Central
0 America, regardless of where he is, is his life, is his life better off under
0 A:  Yeah, well, yo-, in looking, bu-, if you look at the region in, in, uh, to
0 and carry a big stick for, uh, for nothing and, uh,
0 tremendous drug traffic through there, but, uh,
0 you've still got, uh, Cuba that accepts, exerts some influence.
0 A:  The only, the only thing I see about Cuba though, is, uh, after Fidel
0 they, you know, would they be better off under communism.
0 for it but what we would, there would have to be some kind of, there, there
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, you, it's not, it's not just a matter of, uh, of having an
0 of honor in being able to feed your family and there's dishonor in not being
0 able to do it and ...
0 B:  In reality, I think, what they were doing is basically going in and
0 B:  Well, unfortunately for us at least here in the United States, we, the
0 A:  Yeah,
0 B:  Oh yes.
0 B:  with the permanent secretary,
0 A:  Right, I, I've seen it several times.  It's a scream, but I have to go to
0 B:  I think that's something we all ca-,
0 that sort of thing.  So, in, as to those types of interpretations, uh, really
0 made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at.
0 histories that are, were developed around that time, that are available.
0 B:  To deny that, at least the majority of it is true.  So, you know, it
0 B:  Well, you can interpret that the, what the T V show, in the same way that
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  You too.
0 quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing.  I've live abro-,
0 A:  I think so.
0 do you feel, though, about, well I guess it's to their advantage to be a
0 territory, but, um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as
0 B:  Yeah, taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.  Uh, there, I don't know, I
0 become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe
0 A:  Right.  What about if, if, um, they demanded to have Spanish as the
0 B:  I think I would be troubled, I suspect, I believe that any of our states,
0 up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.  Uh, that I, I think that
0 guess.
0 any sort of structured, this is my exercise time --
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  Is that why you like aerobics classes, because you're
0 not, sort of, someone else is doing the counting for you, so,

0 B:  it was, it was quite a lot of fun.
0 swimming weather,
1 from,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 interesting, because there are re-, real regional differences.  Um, in
0 A:  um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation, or something,
0 you know, in your sixties, or something like that, I'm, I'm, I'm not.  Uh,
0 the running craze.  And, they, California gets, you know, tends to be a bit
0 must be something to some of them.  And, uh,
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 anything.  It, it's on fairly so-, solid scientific ground.  Uh, it's just
0 B:  Now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole
0 each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and
0 B:  I can see that.  And, cause, I, knowing from institutes of learning like
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  And, part of it is California, 
0 people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and, before long, you, you get this, this whole kind of Gestalt, this
0 B:  Yeah,
0 A:  It is in the urban areas, yes.
0 vegetarian section now.
0 B:  and foods and things. You don't really have that, I mean, you would

0 A:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 B:  Lubbock, we get ice storms but not, not quite to that extent.  It's not
0 B:  Uh, I think we've been fortunate that we've missed any of the real bad
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  It's either, uh, thirty degrees, you know, one day and ninety the next
0 cold but I guess I can live with it [laughter].
0 big ice storm, uh, where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  came back here and could not realize why I had been so depressed through
0 would start getting cold in September.
0 B:  I mean employers expected people to not necessarily be there on time due
0 A:  Well you know they also did a very good job of, of shoveling the, the
0 B:  Everything stops, yeah.
0 A:  Right, right, you know, you'd, you'd, you get the first, you know, the
0 weather's like that.
0 winters.
0 there's no trees to speak of, you know, and the big, you know, thick trees we
0 A:  Of course we only had a thousand square foot house but we had two acres
0 B:  Sure, once you're out of the house, you're in the street.
0 are just so vivid, um, uh, it's just, that, that's something I miss.  I, I
0 A:  Oh, yeah humid, very humid in New England, I mean you got hundred degree
0 humidity to me because Lubbock is so dry.
0 B:  Uh, you know it may be a hundred and a hundred an five or whatever, up
0 A:  I do both at home. 
0 A:  No, I've, uh, y-, you can rent people's kiln they, they, uh,
0 them. There's one woman that charged ten dollars a month for fire, all that I
0 A:  The paints and stuff can get expensive, the greenware it depends on what
0 B:  Yeah.
0 Disney characters.
0 them to him.
0 A:  I, I do it in the mornings.
0 uh, then we'll get a half hour break, or so, and then I'll go and play another
0 set with somebody else, you know.
0 B:  Wow.
0 A:  But, that was a, for anoth-, you know, I was in another state then.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  No kidding, hobbies are supposed to be enjoyable.  They're not supposed to

0 A:  Yeah, well, uh, get back to computer programming of yours, --
0 A:  -- uh, [laughter] I've been, uh, trying to program some, uh, disc or some,
0 B:  So, uh, I'll try to wear a short sleeve shirt and, uh, um, and that, that's
0 okay. That's appropriate.
0 A:  and the campus is pretty large,
0 A:  so that I would look a little bit different and I would come in and I
0 B:  Um, if you, like when you go out at night, uh, you may just want to have a
0 B:  I see.
0 of money in, in, uh, the heavier, heavier materials.
0 A:  Different shoes, you know, we always had, like, um, higher shoes, higher
0 B:  I'm not for sure, it's, that one in September is when you need to quit.
0 A:  You can only wear, and supposedly, we don't have an opportunity, my
1 A:  two holidays. 
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 husband, he's got a pretty good deal.  I go out and buy all his clothes

0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  At least they might {voices have faded} get some benefit in that, and if
0 B:  And, you can put a collar around a guys leg that will prohibit them from

0 A:  Three or four times, yeah. 
0 building and they work all day, and they go home and they smoke their dope and
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  If they see violence at home, that's what you're going to get from the kids
0 a personality conflict you just, you worked with it and you got through it.
0 B:  Or, one thing or the other.  You look at another kind of society like the
0 to live together.  Okay.  It's in their culture.

0 A:  You must be feeling like it's, uh,
0 B:  I grew up in, you know, I grew in Wyoming. I remember ice storms and,
0 A:  ((That is so wild)).
0 A:  This past Thursday we had winds and, and snow to the point where if you
0 trees, through there cars, you know, trees had fallen right on top of their

0 they don't clean it up just for a little bit,
0 A:  The schools were all closed this week and, there still thinking of closing
0 B:  Oh.
0 B:  But going through it is so much different.  Yeah.

0 A:  but right now people, uh, the cool that (( )),
0 A:  And they just, they enjoy the snow and they enjoy the cold and, and that's
0 like the snow and the cold then you might as well pack your bags and leave,
0 A:  Oh, really. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Hello. 
0 few.

0 B:  uh, out there, uh, #depending on,# 
0 A:  Well, I do some, oh, some needle craft things, hobbies sometimes, some
0 cross stitch, um, no, no sewing or knitting, any of that.  Um, little things,
0 B:  I've got the house stocked with, uh, a lot of their stuff.
0 A:  Oh, that's #beautiful.# 
0 B:  Yeah, they're, they're, uh, quite unique, and, uh, it's, well he's retired,
0 B:  All right. 
0 corrected on 2/5/92 -- lya.
0 uh, not even three month old and, uh, you know, it was a desperate thing, and,
0 A:  And, uh, you know, this, uh, couldn't catch his breath even in his sleep,
0 and that turned me off of day-cares.
0 tells her, I'll miss you, so,
0 A:  Uh, I, I don't know much about day-cares itself, you know,
0 B:  Yeah.  Um,
0 A:  Uh.
0 A:  Well, I had to quit my job because of, um, m-, my two.  You know, um,
0 A:  Yeah. Uh, but, I don't like the punishment the day-care does.  You know, I
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Right.  Right.
0 on.
0 A:  I don't know if they do it either to be truthful.
1 [laughter],
0 there wasn't a meat there, you know, at the, at the table, or even pizzas, you
0 not made for a vegan.  So, but, um, 
0 store will, {rattling noise} you know, the bigger grocery stores.
0 there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to
0 hard to digest all that meat,
0 different casseroles and things.  So,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 you know, everyone's life.
1 is a time for everyone to give thanks [laughter] even turkey, you know.
0 B:  I have a,
0 you can't beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and, and
0 it does when it gets it in raw food, you know,
0 lot better.
0 B:  #C B S.#
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 got, you know.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  and so it really made me question as to what, how do we know, you know,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  Uh, we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS, but I
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  I don't know. It just wouldn't be there whenever I tried it. 
1 B:  This is my first call.
0 A:  Nice talking to you too. 
0 A:  Hey, how you doing?
0 A:  #Yeah.#  What time is it over th-, are you, are you in Dallas?
0 what about credit #card?#
0 B:  Hey.  How do you like it out there [clicking]?
0 A:  Yeah.  That area.  And it's really small.  All, all you have is like towns
0 B:  Well, that's what they look for.  Whether or not they get it is hard to say
0 B:  Yeah [talking].
0 B:  #Yeah.  It's# pretty tough.  It's pretty tough [/talking].  I, uh, let's
0 A:  So, are, are you going to go for your Doctorate?
0 [barking] that keeps pe-, that keeps people #((in)).#
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  No.  Well, it depends on what rank you are, #of course [/barking].# 
0 seventy grand a year.
0 A:  #Yeah.# It's like, no I, I mean, I B M is like, there's a joke about I B M
0 is, that I B M is so stabilized that #everybody will buy their stuff.#
0 you know, a lock on a lot of the market.
0 B:  And a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they
0 A:  -- uh, what they do is they, they put you in a different job.
0 B:  Uh.
0 A:  But they won't let you off.  What they'll do is like [sigh] suppose, you
0 A:  #Right.#
0 A:  #Right.#
0 B:  Well, they're the standard right now.  Or as far as that goes, you know,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  #Oh, yeah [laughter].#
0 B:  [Cough].
0 things that I B M throws away and they (( )), and that's why they're so
0 A:  Because I mean and by the time you have computer for five years, you're
0 like why do you want more.  Because it's like one second of recording.  I mean
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 it's like, of course it does.  I mean, by the times it transforms into Wave by
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I had never really thought of it that way but I guess that's true, I
0 retirement package, do you think?
1 I kind of have to trade off, you know.  If you never see it you don't spend
0 you know.
0 A:  until later. 
0 And, and uh, they have a way that they can figure, you know, what, you know,
0 B:  That's right.  Well, that's what she said to us.  She said, now, do you
0 anybody's going to do it.
0 A:  me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that. 
0 A:  then her little brother's only two years behind and he says, well, I
0 B:  That's right [laughter].  Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some
0 B:  That sounds really good.  I read a thing, I don't even remember if it was
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  true.
0 B:  True. 
0 person and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the
0 that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there.  It seems
0 going to get and what you're not going to get so,
0 anxious for someone to be killed [child]. 
0 B:  That happens on occasion, it sure does, 
0 A:  [Throat_clearing].
0 not.
0 A:  Ye-, it's really sad. 
0 B:  Oh, absolutely. 
0 B:  Tha-, that's right.
0 (( ))think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have
0 fairly recent, in the state of Texas.  Before that, it was, uh, death by
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  certainly not. 
0 jury, 
0 A:  involving a violent crime or anything. 
0 B:  So would I. 
0 A:  Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, uh, talking to you about this.  
0 A:  I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important,
0 A:  Thank you, bye-bye. 
0 know, what they want to be or do or, you know, they could learn something and
0 local, uh, my only experience with it, I was in Central America for a while,
0 B:  Really [laughter]. 
0 been over, you know, coming back right now, you know.
0 understand, from some of the guys I know, you know, crime, uh, is punishable,
0 know, like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that.
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Huh-uh.
0 people and that sort of thing.
0 A:  And, uh, when the politics get real confusing,
0 that somebody had paid somebody to, you know, get supported, or,
0 up of the group was such and such, you know, they'd have to do that percentage
0 B:  That could be a complicated too, couldn't it. 
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  -- And they had all kinds of, uh, things they could go into, agricultural,
0 and you know,
0 particular chance, your chance of having to do something was, it was very
0 them, it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah, and they have,
1 B:  Oh, yeah [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  but, you know, that it is incredible, you know.
0 A:  Yes. 
0 A:  Well, that's the idea.  They figure that,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah right.  Absolutely. 
1 A:  they figure that, that's correct [laughter].
0 A:  oh, absolutely, preapproved.  That's their favorite word. 
0 B:  So, 
0 B:  And, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you
0 background noise}.
0 A:  that they have, but what about, um, their reputation of the company or
0 sounds} I wouldn't buy something else, how about you?
0 that reason, but ((have)) not been entirely happy with, uh, several things
0 to make that decision.
0 breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be
0 B:  No but then,
0 B:  Yeah, that, I think that's,
0 way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 @B:  Well, uh, the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time, are crafts and, uh,
0 B:  How about yourself?
0 A:  uh, I used to do that a lot and then I like, um, we have a new child that
0 ((druther)), if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  If you can do things together, that really helps a lot.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 of stuff, we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a
0 B:  And we like movies, that ki-, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, that's, uh, spare time, with a child it's, kind of stra-, she's, we
0 B:  Sure.
0 A:  those kind of things, um,
0 B:  Yeah, we did some remodeling when we bought a house, we built, put a
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Sounds like it.
0 A:  Do you like to cook?
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  #Well, uh, uh, smoking and# all that stuff? 
0 B:  and, uh, worked in the Abilene plant, and we used to go to Joe Allen's
0 B:  Yes [laughter]. 
0 hobbies there.
0 A:  I enjoyed speaking with you --
0 A:  Yeah.  That's, that's true.  I think in, uh, the Texas governor elections,
0 people just get all insp-, inspired, you know,
0 the, and that sort of movement, and so it's, uh, quite the opposite, so
0 B:  [Baby_talking] Yeah, I can understand why, why some of the, the rural
0 know, like the no new taxes thing.  You know, that's, uh, with the economy
0 it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't
0 B:  [Baby_talking].
0 this way so, uh, they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their,
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  Wow.  This is, I'm in, from, this is Dallas where I'm at. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  And they play a lot, they play a lot longer season, too.
0 California baseball.
0 this year, I don't even remember his name either.
0 B:  Every once in a while I, I like to go on the nights when there's not
0 B:  Yeah.  B-, sometimes when I, if you go out there during the day, you just
0 A:  That's when I've been.
0 B:  But, uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice, and I heard that
0 there's, uh, that you can bid on that stadium last night on the news I heard
0 you, so.
0 B:  And it's going to go to the highest bidder [laughter].
0 A:  You hear that?  [noise].  That's my kids turning on their music.
0 B:  That's typical bureaucracy though.
1 B:  You don't even know who to payoff, huh?  [laughter].
0 A:  and I finally just got to where I go, okay, I'm Debbie Moore, you know,
0 may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for, you know.
0 A:  Uh, this is my eleventh year.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 one is.
0 B:  So, how long are we suppose to talk for?
0 A:  Well, you know, I hadn't either till last night, I was talking to this
0 A:  and we started talking about gangs, you know.
0 A:  And then tonight this woman called, have you taken any incoming calls?
0 B:  Oh, gosh, (( )) all the other, the one I talked about the other night was
0 A:  Oh yeah, I could go on and on about that.
0 first hour he started looking at his watch.
0 A:  Huh.
0 A:  One is eight and one is eleven.
0 A:  They usually pick their own.
0 B:  I bet they do.
0 A:  Well, and Ninja Turtles.
0 B:  Yeah, Ninja Turtles, got to have those.
0 A:  plug it in.
0 B:  Of course, you have to get there early if you want to get anything,
0 A:  I know {Voice in background}.
0 A:  Unbelievable [sniffing].  {Background music gets even louder}.
0 B:  Yeah, sure did.
0 house is not, uh, is not worth it.  How about in your case?
0 house, it's, uh, we have thirty-two hundred square feet, and it's a brick
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 city's a little upset with him, but I understand you save a lot of money off,
0 A:  N-, no, we're, well, uh, our kids are kind of still small now, and we had
0 can basically be, be put on any lot, in any state, any kin-, you know, so
0 out and sub it, if, even if you don't want to get hands on,
0 B:  you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things and,
0 B:  Sure, I can imagine.
0 A:  Yeah, I mean it's not an Eldorado house or anything like that, but, you
0 B:  What do you know about timber framing?
0 B:  And it's a, it's a, you know what a mansard roof is?
0 A:  Uh-huh
0 B:  Uh-huh.

0 really do.  And it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse and
0 emissions, something that wasn't quite right and they wouldn't pass it, and, I
0 uh, he had to have a lot of work done on it before it would meet, you know,
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 A:  Yeah, and from what I understand, New York City is worse. That it just
0 do that, and put in trains and stuff,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And they go all around, that it's just real easy to get around once you're
0 wait until it's too late to do anything, we're going to have to live in
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  I think it's five,
0 A:  #Texas.# 
0 B:  #I like# the place.
0 Pagosa Springs, and we went up kind of in the Southwest corner of Colorado.
0 A:  #on your back [laughter],#
0 experience and this was in the middle of the summer and we woke up one morning
0 to California and once to, and twice to Wyoming.
0 B:  And it, it's a totally deserted island there's no buildings there at all.
0 B:  #and we sailed out there and camped# and it was, it was really neat because
0 B:  #Yeah,#
0 trap and all these hotels and stuff and this was,
0 A:  I can imagine [laughter].
0 was, wasn't, um, it's more work than a backpacking because you had to worry
0 A:  #Oh, no.#
0 B:  #we went camping# up in the Appalachians.
0 A:  Oh, hold on just a moment.
0 it's a little bit different.

0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 cold.#
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 organization without having, you know, when they cut off a system and they
0 don't just can everybody that is working on it, like some companies I know of.
0 A:  So you work for it T I then [music]. {pause} You can't say?
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 you know, I put my kids on my policy.  It's like two hundred dollars
0 okay.  But if you pay out less, then you lose that money.
1 B:  Yeah. He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it [laughter].
0 B:  We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to
0 hired --
0 a job.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 your job unless you really did something horrendous.
0 B:  Well, they, they really can't fire you without cause, you know the
0 shop, for instance, should have to have degree at all.
0 A:  In some places they don't. 
0 got now, was my experience in the construction field, prior to going to
0 A:  Well, see, we've got a little bit of it, but not much.  It would be nice if
1 A:  Huh-uh.
0 A:  Well, so you get to evaluate him though? 
0 quotas, what not, for me to make, but, um, the bottom line on, on that kind of
0 st-, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric so it's, it
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah, see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.  My,

0 everything in a grocery store.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.

0 hundred years ago, when we were first starting the country may have been
0 for the men who were working.  Now days it's like, everything is so, is, is

0 not use that particular drug testing agency that T I is using.
0 A:  Is that right? 
0 B:  [Laughter].

0 guys, I'll tell you.
0 A:  Uh, yeah.

0 A:  I hadn't heard.
0 or I don't remember it if I have.
0 A:  How old are they?

0 would have thought a child had died.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them
0 A:  And they didn't used to be actually, but they got kind of wild and weren't
0 into hiding.
0 A:  I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony [laughter].
0 B:  We started out with two, with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided
0 B:  And he's like oh, thank you so much.
0 B:  Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started
0 B:  There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.
0 B:  And, uh, well I fell in love with this, uh, it's a Chinchilla Persian,

0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, yes.
0 A:  So I found this one and, uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell
0 drive-thru that said free kittens.
0 B:  Oh uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 A:  but he doesn't bite anybody he's just, he's just kind of there, real
0 B:  And, but oh, they're so much fun to watch them play.
0 A:  Really.
0 I love them to death.
0 A:  What are your cats names.
0 A:  and Rascal is a black and white short hair. 
0 moved out of the house also.
1 ripped up and down at the bottom he said, of course I love cats.
0 A:  Oh really, [laughter] oh well.
0 A:  That's life, that's how life goes.
0 B:  So where have you been, where have you been camping before?
0 know, was kind of groggy, didn't know what was going on and crawled out of

0 Indians got real religious up there because it's just, it's just awesome up

1 things going, of course, I got it going full bore.  I run out of propane.
1 [laughter]  Oh.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 trying to think of exactly where we were.  Uh, we were on another lake, I
0 or thirty guys playing volleyball on the beach and this, this cove, this beach

0 of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different
0 B:  Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh, well two, two of
0 them actually.  Uh, the RAIN MAN was one.  
0 B:  Wasn't that fabulous, and,
0 B:  And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet.
0 B:  Yes, right, and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie.  The acting
0 B:  Oh yes, Jessica Tandy won best actress and, uh,
1 A:  Is, is the Kmart there?  [laughter].
0 Kmart everywhere?
0 A:  That was, that was so funny, he had to, or was it Kmart.
0 A:  and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental
0 know, and, and, and you need to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on,
0 A:  Not, not toward winning in Las Vegas, for example.
0 times.
0 didn't, he only saw it one time, and he didn't go back for more, but, uh, he,
0 B:  Right, yeah.
0 off and, and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way
0 B:  [TV] Uh-huh, or it could be like the draft where, you know, before they
0 draft notice and then they give you a physical and if there's nothing
1 you are.
0 B:  That would be good.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Well that's true.  America's paying all this money to have other people
0 farming, or, or something like that, so you're really learning a skill [/TV].
0 A:  I'm just teasing [laughter].
0 Truman had, or was it Roosevelt, I can't remember, um, with the big,

0 A:  It's between Texas and Louisiana, it crosses into both of them.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.
0 was a, uh, a Texan, but I guess that's, uh, that's what we're going to have.
0 A:  There is somebody and I, (( )), uh, I can't remember who it is but there's
0 A:  That proposed it, I read something in PEOPLE about it.
0 and money to, uh, help the homeless, but, uh.
0 statement [dishes].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people
0 coal, you know.
0 A:  I don't either.  I mean it says just keep on until and they'll notify you.
0 At first I was thinking it was just a week because that's all it shows, you
0 B:  Oh, I don't know.
0 A:  Let's see, one of my friends had a roommate that worked for T I and she
0 B:  That's good, especially since you call that one eight hundred number so,
0 =========================================================================
0 A:  I recycle my newspapers and, uh, alumi-, my aluminum stuff.
0 A:  But, uh, they make it as hard as possible, it's not very convenient to

0 A:  Yeah, yeah, 
0 packing boxes.
0 all that stuff and, and here we are wasting.  And I don't understand,
0 A:  So, you know, there, they don't take up much storage space.
0 A:  And I am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes.
0 with a lot of my daughter's things is I'll store her, you know, like her out
1 B:  You saved me some money.
0 B:  But anyway.
0 A:  Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
0 A:  uh, it was AWAKENINGS with, uh, Robin Williams and, uh, Peter DeNiro.
0 where, the, uh, the show is about these, uh, catatonic type people that, this
0 reminding yourself that he's an actor.
0 B:  Um, let's see, when I, each time that I thought that the Indians were going
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
0 what else did it.  Um, what other parts.  I can't remember any of the other
0 out from under him.
0 B:  Uh-huh, well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the
0 could follow this, this beaten down path,
0 B:  I wonder how they kept up with them, though, it seemed like the buffaloes
0 B:  I guess they graze, though, that wouldn't ((be a)) problem.
0 A:  It was, they tried to keep it, you know, as very close to real.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Well, uh, she said, uh, one was a total ban on gun control and ten was,
0 A:  Oh yeah, well we're probably not too far apart.  I'd probably fall in there
0 A:  Well I pretty much agree with that, that's uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah, in the whole state.
0 B:  -- they're now criminals.
0 understand the idea that people think that, I mean, I, I'm all for

0 B:  Sure.
0 A:  I'm in, uh, Trenton, Texas.
0 A:  Well, Jerry, do you have a favorite team?
0 really good team.
0 and of course they started out with Don Meredith.
0 A:  They could have had a good year this year, uh, unfortunately the
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  So, I don't know if he's going to be in shape to,
0 A:  I think Buffalo is an up an coming team.  They're going to, they're showing
0 Francisco.
0 B:  But, uh, but some of these, some of the, uh, I get a little disappointed
0 older days.#
0 willing to pay if unfortunately.  Uh, and you get star players like, uh, like
0 A:  I don't go to games myself, uh, uh.
0 A:  No, you, you really can't, not when it costs twenty-six dollars a ticket
0 B:  You, you take, yeah, you take, just two just a man and wife by the time you
0 are all wealthy people.
0 B:  And also, I don't like the deal with the, uh Cowboys stadium where that
0 B:  The only seats they have available are in the end zone.
0 A:  And, uh, every, every opportunity there is to make a dollar, he seems to
0 some support.  There were a lot of people that are, uh, that were skeptical
0 quarterback but if they don't have any blocking, maybe, they can't do
0 A:  I don't know what Philadelphia's going to do without Buddy Ryan, it might
0 A:  uh, and they create a lot of excitement locally, so I think they're good
0 B:  Yeah, but, uh, to me he's --
0 A:  Oh, he's great, I saw him play when he as at, uh, U N L V.
0 except maybe a defensive lineman.
0 A:  The World Wide Area Football League, waffle, or whatever they call it.
0 really don't have the physical skills or the talent.
0 experts all at once.
0 B:  You know, it was just, there were too many long articles and I try to
0 A:  Oh, I wa-, assumed that these were home telephone numbers.  Uh, we also get
0 B:  Well ours, uh, that we tend to listen to most, um, I like the way they
0 handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they'll
0 have, you know, five minutes worth of news every half hour, but in the middle
0 A:  Uh-huh.  You mean when the reporter sticks the, the microphone in the
0 that maybe our world was a little bit better place when I was in high school
0 A:  Well it's sure been nice visiting with you.
0 A:  Oh, well have a good day then.
0 A:  And, uh, I don't know whether that's bad or good, it's just a point that
0 not wealthy,
0 pollution?
0 pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano, uh, it's certainly less than
0 that.  And, uh, I've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, uh,
0 it's kerosene or what that's dropping.  But, other than that, you know, we
0 don't have the, unless we're catching it from the midwest, the emissions.
0 Island uses coal to, uh, 
0 they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky,
0 A:  and, they do that at night too, because,
0 Um, ye-, I'm not an expert.
0 B:  Up here?
0 B:  I haven't read that.
0 B:  Oh yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 damage that they attributed to acid rain.
0 thought it was,
0 B:  Yeah, so it's, it's less than clear.  Like I said, I don't remember the
0 A:  Uh, we can demand, uh, more efficient automobiles for one thing.  I still
0 B:  of the automobile pollution and the new cars it's hardly is, hardly 
0 A:  Yeah, they're better, but how about all the trucks and buses that are 
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  Yeah, diesel engines.
0 A:  I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up
0 and town will have a meter on your [laughter] tail pipe generating #generating
0 B:  Yeah, but, uh, you know, it's, uh, I guess the difficulty would be to, 
0 B:  Right.
0 that's a thought.  No,
0 A:  you know, through the disk, 
0 A:  And, so they don't have a disk drive.
0 system, you can't store it anywhere.
0 A:  And then you also have to do all your grading on the P C.
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 that.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not, you know.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  You know, go back and forth and, and, you know, you always, you know, the
0 the same time, and you can see that, where it messed up, because, you know
0 A:  you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the
1 A:  It's like yeah, I think I'll buy a new car today, you know, so,
0 A:  Yeah, but I mean the price has really gone down.  I mean, I B M which, uh,
0 B:  Oh, sure, oh, sure.
0 A:  it because it's like, if we sell it for less, you know, it's like we're
0 B:  Oh.
0 B:  Well.
0 A:  So, what kind of eating out do you prefer?  Do you like,
0 B:  Yeah, and are loud so when he gets loud it's not too, it doesn't bother the
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 B:  I mean I like the way it taste good and it's fast.  I like that too.
0 food best.
0 A:  you know, sausage, because I'm from New Orleans originally.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 everything, it had all the vegetables in it, but, it seemed kind of boring
0 A:  Right.
0 changing the way that you fi-, that you entertain?
0 entertaining, I don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really,
0 A:  So, um, I've ((read)) a good brownie recipe.
0 A:  Okay, well it was nice talking to you.
0 B:  Well, uh, a little bit, uh, noth-, nothing overly strenuous.  No, the
0 A:  Oh, man, I imagine.
0 headwaters, come down about halfway and then you get to, you spend the night
0 B:  Okay.
0 it.  I like being able to go back into the mountains,
0 B:  Boy, I bet, yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Don't let that stop you [laughter].
0 B:  No, no, we haven't made that trip yet.
0 know, the excitement of doing it, so.
0 B:  So, uh, yeah, in fact, uh, uh, well I got married last summer and, uh,
0 child is a girl, was born three years ago, three and a half.
0 afraid of her shadow anymore, that I'm, I'm hoping and crossing my fingers
0 looks like, you know, and okay, now we'll go look for one.
0 important to, uh, me today would probably be, uh, something to do with
0 A:  Yeah that's true, that's true.
0 plans where, you know, you have the, the, uh, option of contributing to, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 you know, you can pick the kind of insurance you want, and the kind of dental
0 benefits but they can pick them from different, whatever is most important to
0 B:  Right, yeah, it's, and it's, uh, it, it's, uh, uh, a hassle trying to, to,
0 B:  yeah the, yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important
0 the coverage in case that your, in case you have another child, or have a
0 A:  Probably five years I think,
0 A:   or seven, uh, that's kind of far away [laughter].
0 hostage crisis,

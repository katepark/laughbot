0 A:  But, on the other hand, you know, I, I've, um, I took a boat cruise one
0 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Yes. 
0 A:  Yeah, well, it's, it's like so many, it's like chicken.  You know, they go
0 B:  No, they did away with it, 
0 A:  That, that may, tha-,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Well, the interesting thing was is I had heard that, and I, I, I tend to, I
0 A:  Yeah.

0 should have, I guess I should make another one that says religious or
0 said, well let me think, you talked about the telephone calls and people
0 problems in that, in that area of the house.
1 course, if I didn't think that way, we wouldn't still be living here
0 A:  Okay, like I said I guess it would be the work force, you know, as far as
0 I've done that to do something,
0 always been that way.
0 B:  Oh no, I can remember my mother getting in trouble if, you know, one of
0 A:  and right from day one, she was teaching me.
0 A:  And since then, I, I live alone,

0 A:  But, uh, I do make her come in.
0 B:  You too.
0 A:  How about you?

0 across.
1 appreciate an outhouse you know you've been ((roughing)) it [laughter],

1 B:  I mean, my agree is absolutely worthless. 
0 B:  And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.  
0 B:  Well I might have liked some of that I, I like hot stuff, 
0 be important for me that, that there wasn't that it was optional, that if, if
0 A:  Huh-uh. So you're saying,
0 A:  like a second job.
0 Texas,
0 to fish on the lake,
1 [laughter],
0 B:  Yeah, and, uh, you know, I find those to be pretty good.  They, uh, the
0 wasn't really interested in.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah, it's really more, kind of all over the south,
0 popularity again,
0 B:  Oh, really.
1 B:  So, unless the kids are asleep I don't get, usually get much done either
1 A:  And, uh, she wanted me to bring it in, she's going to play it on Saturday

0 B:  Um.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  It was nice talking to you.
0 A:  and it was, it was I remember the first day of Spring, it was so much ice
1 conversation, anyway.
0 older, older than the date on the package or whatever.
1 B:  Huh-uh.  Yeah, it hasn't been, I know, I was called up right away
0 B:  Right.  I think there's some flaws in it.  I think their main objective is,
0 is good, you know, to make sure they have a drug free workplace, but I do
0 not use that particular drug testing agency that T I is using.
0 B:  But, uh, oh, I watch things like, uh, SIXTY MINUTES,
0 B:  Yeah, just something like that for, you know, uh, end of the evening type
0 A:  show, but [throat_clearing], and they watch a couple of shows like that,
1 something,
0 B:  In fact, I probably am more interested in watching some of the
0 A:  so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are
0 A:  Bye-bye.
0 B:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].
0 A:  And the idea that, that we would survive long enough to get to that point
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  They even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan, and it was very, very funny.
0 A:  And the people in the city were saying, well why should I go do that.
0 A:  No, no, no, like that ((Joe Hosago)) [laughter], you know.
0 A:  And it started raining and I was hysterical.  I was, I was, I mean, you
0 B:  The, the cat almost died, and but he turned out to be such a wonderful
0 outside,
1 B:  It was like we can't take it back you've got, we've got to keep it now.
0 story.
0 A:  What are your cats names.
0 A:  Me to.  Bye, bye.
0 one of the other college kids and they were a little concerned.  They had
1 B:  Oh, how awful [laughter].
0 the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of
0 B:  Like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why.
0 B:  But, uh, it's, uh, it's a dirty fuel, that's for sure.
0 A:  Yeah, well how did you get into this program.
1 so probably knock T I profits margin way down.
0 A:  Those and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in, with the
0 A:  Those are perfect boxes to put files in.
0 A:  It is.  I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro.
0 B:  Um, I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful,
0 A:  I think the Cowboys have shown a lot of improvement this, uh, past year.
1 A:  No, I like the team, I really, really like the Eagles a lot, but, uh, Buddy
0 league's going to fare.
0 N,
0 earth shaking.
0 B:  Yeah, I, I, yeah, I, I, I truly believe that, that before that, that we
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, we generate, one of our, our biggest electrical plants in Rhode
0 B:  for less pollutant vehicles.
0 B:  Right.  Yeah, no I, um, I, I have both, because that, that's what I use all
0 that.
0 when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this, all these
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 P C [laughter].
0 A:  every once in a while and go to a nice quiet restaurant sometime.
1 Italian and,
0 never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like
0 our little group of friends here, we've been kind of getting married
0 B:  [Laughter] Well, yeah, that's, ever-, everybody might learn something that
0 watching, you know, hunt, hunt with a camera type of thing or, there's a lot
0 A:  Yeah that's true, that's true.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Right, yeah, it's, and it's, uh, it, it's, uh, uh, a hassle trying to, to,
0 else.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  and I don't know if it will ever happen again but,
0 A:  That is fabulous.
0 B:  I was never that brave but, uh, [noise] [sniffing] yeah. 
1 not real old, my wife she is old too,
0 B:  my parents, yeah, my husband likes, uh, country music real well and he,
0 B:  really, than, than television, kep-, your imagination --
1 B:  -- i-, i-, kept and yo-, it just didn't vegetate your mind like television
0 doing anything, they're not invading anything.
0 it's everybody.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 ster-, well how long does it take for marijuana to get out of your body?
0 B:  That's right, yeah.  
0 A:  You know, so why charge me more.  
0 when I left high school and I think there's a, there's a real challenge there.
0 these people do if they were brought in?
0 initial --
0 B:  when I, when I do that because, you know, she's a teenager --
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  All right.  Bye-bye.  
0 WITH THE ENEMY.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A: -- did a really good job.  Very, uh, emotional, put it that way.
0 A:  He, he doesn't complete the job, though and his hands are, are, are not
0 area.
0 A:  Oh, they, well they have more of the artsy type of, uh, 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  she's really good.  
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah, it was, it has a real eerie beginning and the man that she's
0 A:  And FATAL ATTRACTION was on the same theme,
0 being brought up, you know, in a, uh, kind of a, uh, community,
0 B:  Uh [throat_clearing], 
0 would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center.
0 A:  i-, it seems in my experience I'm running across single women all the
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 I think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it.
1 we could, uh,
1 A:  You know.  We just got our phone back today, uh,
0 A:  -- #to be doing that.#
0 A:  Yeah.
0 it helps, so [sniffing], 
1 know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala.
0 B:  Right, #right.#
1 A:  I think they just put them in jail and let them think about it [laughter].
0 B:  I don't think everybody that kills somebody should -- 
1 B:  Well, see he shouldn't have been trying to slit her throat anyway
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Because if you can stop, uh, Cuban cigars from coming, you can't buy
0 B:  Oh, they're just not, once they get into junior high it just,
0 youngest was about two, we decided to get out of the city and go to the
1 B:  At least start saving.   
1 A:  Hey, I'm headed there [laughter].   
1 B:  Whether you like the mascot or not, or whether [laughter] it's close by.
0 things you can call and talk, and find out about.  So, that is something you
0 church, even though it's, you know, maybe it's thirty minutes away, because
1 it's a big, you know, Dallas area is a big metropolitan area.
0 most of them were on social security, and they got some kind of supplemental
0 know, they lived in their own little house.
0 A:  See, now we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were, well,
0 it's probably not widely available.
0 B:  Everybody needs some sense of responsibility.
0 B:  #An even, even if it's just a little bit.#
1 A:  Yeah.
0 would always have season tickets, and they'd go to all the games, and you
0 A:  Okay.
0 the short weather.
0 campus it's very strange, because a lot of black people,
0 very informal company.  Uh, I, I think the thing that I've noticed in more
0 A:  Yeah.
1 about clothing, right.  So, I don't know what to say.  I don't wear any
0 A:  Oh, that's okay.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Fernando, glad to know you.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 and, uh, we're just getting started.  As a matter of fact this last week we
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But you'd think that, uh, garages could do that.
0 A:  Yeah, never did some,
1 there.
0 B:  -- I lived in England for about four years, so it really brings back --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 if it were.
0 B:  -- sorry I missed that one.
0 B:  Yeah, I'd, I'd probably, I'd probably get cable, but I've got, we got the,
1 something I want [laughter].
0 A:  There's a big difference there.
0 A:  Well, it, uh, i-, must be, I think it's a matter of degree, and, uh --
0 You know, they'd take her down to the juvenile hall, and then they'd have to
1 A:  I'll eat the dark meat, but you can have the white meat.
1 they, they had, they had three kinds of potatoes.
1 A:  They had mashed potatoes, they had French fries, and they had au gratin.
1 A:  Like I really need the cholesterol.
0 B:  There you go.
0 for about, it's about six bucks.
0 A:  But uh, it's a pretty neat chain, because they, they don't take out loans
0 B:  really a neat phenomena how it all works out.
0 A:  Huh.
0 A:  How does that coach feel about that?
0 B:  --in, uh, games and stuff because of, uh, uh, Dana Kirk, that was their
0 coach down there, uh, or over there.  Uh, he, he was, uh, we was living in
0 B:  too.  All right, well --
0 B:  Yeah, it's, it's less degree days, you're right.  But I think, I think,
0 A:  Marvin Edwards.
0 that, spent on each pupil.
0 A:  Right.
0 that until at least the first part of May.
1 A:  -- I'll call you.
0 know a few months ago, I, I would feel that I had to explain to them that I'm
0 B:  Yeah.
0 to Baylor, and a lot of students from Baylor go and, and serve as missionaries
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, they couldn't cover my hourly rate [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, I don't know either.  (( )) Growing up, all I knew was you go to high
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah, I don't have too much of a green thumb either.  So.
1 A:  Plano, oh, yeah.  I'm out in Rowlett, and we have that brown clay soil
0 of.
0 stuff.
0 A:  #Oh well, that's good to know.#
0 A:  Yeah, it's kind of cute.  Um.
0 B:  Yeah, I like the lessons.  It's a good, uh --
1 A:  I know [laughter].
0 B:  and I've, I've been in the middle of tests and stuff so I keep you
0 B:  Right [laughter].
0 to get things done --
1 [laughter].
0 A:  And, they, they just got, you know, they, they go back and forth, and it's
0 tha-, that probably wipes out my whole inventory of T V shows, other than, um,
0 B:  -- that's about the only thing that I really catch on P B S --
0 lately, but.
1 under and had a rice field.
0 A:  Well it, 
0 again.  So, we're still cleaning up.  We actually left, the last people got
0 B:  Sounds like the aftermath of like a hurricane down here.
0 degree day I can handle, but the, the, the sad part about here is that winter
0 B:  Well do you, do you, so you go, if you're, if you're not doing any kind of
0 our family is you real-, we really don't have any privacy when we're at home,
0 A:  So there was always, there was never just one alone, you know.
0 A:  But, yeah, it's so, it would be really hard now to have twelve children.
0 A:  Well,
1 @B:  Uh, well, to tell you the truth, my husband does most of the work.
1 B:  Yeah, that's fine [laughter].
0 I feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that, with a [laughter]
0 you know, that goes between the grass and the sidewalk.  Um.
0 A:  Do they do something to the lawn mower to, to help it, uh, stay inside or
0 all himself now.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh, gee, I, I'd say our grass is getting green right now.
1 A:  And, uh, I'm trying to find a way how to electrify it or motorize it
0 than, than a few hours.
1 B:  Hey, that'd work for me, let me tell you [laughter].
0 A:  -- yeah, was, the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  So this is where the people have been kind of {pause} W-, I don't
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  But I really enjoyed it, though.
0 B:  I remember when I was real little, I, we all went to some kind of scary
1 A:  Oh, uh-huh, oh.
1 A:  Yeah.
0 winds coming in off the ocean,
0 B:  the northeast winds bring in all kind of weather from the Atlantic Ocean,
0 B:  I've got a son lives in Riverside and I drove across the Mohave Desert,
0 A:  Especially if you can get, find some shade.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah [laughter] that's the hard thing out that way, but,
0 B:  and it, it will change up and give you something that you may like worse
1 ice age.  And I think you all were about a mile and a half deep in ice
0 needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the, the, uh,
0 A:  Right, well, I guess ((he'd)) have to be careful whether, with entrapment
0 A:  Well, the, the problem I had with the movie was the problem I've had with a
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Right, exactly, yeah, there, there, there are several movies that hit home
0 B:  [Laughter] Got to go take care of the children,
0 B:  I think it's come along very slowly.  I think that, uh, a lot of the
0 A:  -- are you familiar with that? 
1 A:  -- I have the kids clamoring for my attention now, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- for a couple years, and, uh, [laughter] I, I was giving my boss a hard
0 B:  Plus, you know, you, you want to think that, that you're working with
1 A:  And I just, you know, went, Oh, where?  [Laughter].
0 B:  That's awful.
0 A:  [Laughter] So I tried to cover it with white, and it was quite a, a feat
0 B:  Oh, gosh, yeah.  Just, just the opposite of what everybody's, uh, working
0 representation in Congress.

0 B:  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Now I never knew they were that, that big, huh,
0 riflery, and all the things that kids do at those camps, but then go to their
0 Dallas, and they said, oh, well, we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that
1 blew down, and,
1 haven't been in a movie since [laughter],
0 B:  Stop by and get them at, you know, for ninety-nine cents, and bring them

0 B:  Sure.  
0 B:  I mean, fifteen bucks to go see a movie with -- 
0 more interesting to me.
1 A:  I, I'll bet they could hold their own in the N B A. 
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  Well, this has been fun.  I've enjoyed talking with you.  
0 is that it, it would be a great experience for kids.
1 A:  -- uh, certainly, you know, there could be advantages and things to be
0 reasonable.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  I wish I was lucky enough to not want to work [laughter] you know.
1 and twenty-one.  The numbers keep changing so it's hard for me to remember

1 and then they start saying, no, so [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, yeah.   
1 B:  Yeah, my oldest daughter is hard headed,   
1 A:  [Laughter] She told him no he couldn't do it,
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 those --
0 B:  -- you know, I just did it, it's very frustrating (( )) a hot topic for me,
0 sister [child_yelling] lives over there, and they just, they just never have
0 like all in, it's just all in practice, it's all in plan.  I think that we
1 B:  It's funny that those are my two, my husband's two favorite shows, too,
0 fact, there was one show that he even turned down a date with some, you know,
0 A:  So what do you, what do you consider your favorite shows?
0 B:  They didn't.
0 the romance there.  I'd just as soon have the, the police story without all
0 dying.
0 B:  -- you ought to do your job --
0 A:  I've, I've only known two people in a nursing home, and you know, it was my
0 A:  Anyway.  Uh, being in Rochester, you probably like the Mets.
0 B:  Yes, I'm actually a Met, I'm, I'm one of these people who's actually a die
0 B:  Yeah, it's, it's, I, I, I find it very strange.  Um, more people, you know,
1 B:  I never fou-, I never quite found a New York fan.
0 B:  Yeah, I,
0 the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route, um, against Boston --
0 A:  Well, his knees were bothering him, yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah, well it takes me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium.
0 B:  What, what are you doing?
0 B:  -- I, I lived in places, like when I lived in Washington, uh, Washington, D
0 twenty years old, and it's always the same man --
0 B:  Well, I, I'm doing computer science, computer engineering.
0 A:  Oh.
0 interested.  Well, at least for a year and a half --
1 the oil or the gas would turn to slush.  Huh-uh.  See, I can't handle that
0 it, but when it gets hot like this --
0 A:  That's right.  That's about like it is, too.
0 A:  That's about it.  That's about all you can say about it [laughter].
0 A:  Uh, that's one of mine, my husband's a little more inclined toward that,
0 everything's too topical nowadays.
1 A:  Oh, is it [laughter].
0 a couple of years, plus extension.  And, uh,
1 A:  That's too bad that's not the topic, I know [laughter].
0 B:  Have you read Tom Clancy?
1 I read about fifty pages, and I just said, I can't take it.
0 it, I didn't, you know, I really, you have to be interested in the subject
0 said that, you know, as a small child, he basically was amoral.
0 B:  Uh, then a big, you know, my big problem would be, what if you were in a,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  No, it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together,
0 World Order.
1 know what I saying?
0 dangerous, and I don't see that this one world, this New World Order that him
0 B:  Right.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  I know, I agree,
1 in big trouble,
1 birthday party and a war started in Israel [laughter].
0 B:  Right, it will be.
1 A:  Isn't that funny.  I bet they're going to do a lot of research on that.
1 A:  I know, the female version of John Lennon's, but,
0 but I guess that's better than nothing, you know.
0 we're supposed to be talking about fishing, now stop, but, anyway, is that
0 the more affluent divisions through robberies, rape and, uh, car crime.
0 A:  So that's a big concern if you live there,
0 A:  -- from someone else --
0 B:  Right, I think so, and uh,
1 A:  I know it but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city, believe it or
0 A:  -- but I don't think you would, uh, someone might grab you, mess around
1 A:  Right.  Never been married.
0 important.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  How about any matching programs?  Have you ever, you know what I
1 A:  Yeah, I think you're right.
1 years go.
0 B:  Now, I'm sorry, what is, what is this again?  [Laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  We're going, we're going through the exact same thing. 
0 A:  It does-, it really doesn't, uh, makes a big difference.
0 aluminum, yeah, so.
0 B:  Well, but in general I think it's a good idea because --
0 get ambitious.  Well, we took one load over there, and now we've got these
0 B:  [Laughter]
0 with my parents, and I never really got into that too much, because you have
1 B:  -- no.  
1 B:  Well, I'm a fisher [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 really about it.  Mostly just the lakes around here, and I fish to take home
1 B:  -- my daughter caught fish, his daughter caught fish,
0 A:  I'm sure it's not a fish, right.  And crab, they don't bite like that, they
1 foot,
0 better.  I think the teachers that we have now are more professional, and I
0 those parents who are in a lower income and have to spend more of their energy
0 job, because the kids spend more time with the parents than they spend at
1 B:  Yeah.  And here, in Texas, if you don't like football,
0 of be on call all the time, and have to go in at any time, and --
0 B:  -- and so we, by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away.
1 from us for so long [laughter],
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 need to go check on them [laughter].
0 What, you know, I mean they fine the industries, but you know, that doesn't
0 not to push the limit too hard, I guess --
0 what the damage is --
0 doing, doing some damage --
0 A:  Yeah, you're fa-, --
0 A:  That's incredible.
0 under staffed, you know --
0 B:  Yes.
0 know, too bad a shape --
0 A:  I think that's wonderful, I really do, just as long as they can, and then
0 four or five times that I swim.
0 A:  Was this a mechanical hitch?
1 B:  No, no, all nuts and bolts.
0 brakes.
0 B:  -- because it means, if I take it somewhere to do it, I have to take it to
1 financial institution is a house of cards, waiting to collapse.
0 B:  I don't think there is a, I don't know if there is a minimum.
0 those --
0 A:  You know, the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get,
0 A:  Well, if we all try a little bit, a little bit goes a long way.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  But, anyway, instead of putting our foot down about it, we just went, okay,
0 future, what we'll do is pay twice a, twice a month on it, and, because you
0 keep, you know, kind of for emergency purposes, and I have, you know, I use a
0 definition.
0 A:  Oh, okay, well, that's, that's neat.
0 B:  I, I, 
0 B:  Oh, so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever.
0 don't want to vote, I don't want to do this and that.  Well, then they could,
0 they had an election, and they had, what, like a ninety-eight percent turnout.
1 Richards.
0 suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just,
0 whatever, and so.
0 A:  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, it's interesting, because when we cook here, I'm
0 A:  -- and chop some scallions and a little ginger --
0 B:  Where are you at?
0 B:  Haven't figured out what I want to be when I grow up.
0 dispelled that idea when I became a substitute teacher for a while, just to
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 lawyers {/imitating a woman} and you know, all this, and it was just
0 A:  Uh, no I wasn't.
0 B:  Especially when you got some, uh, jerk coming in.  
0 know.
1 A:  I often think, Gee, I wish I had a video camera, because I could sure use
0 B:  anthem I will never watch her show.
1 it every evening when I come home.
1 A:  And her and Frank and the baby.  
0 you think it'll ever be back.  And they said, No, we don't think it will be.
1 season.
0 A:  But you watch it.
0 around.  To me, that is very boring.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Oh [tone] {long drawn out sound}.
0 A:  -- education teacher.
1 that's, that's the best time to see them, and they don't last too long,
0 A:  Pollen count, yeah.  Exactly.
1 A:  And, you know, the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties,
0 A:  They, they feel claustrophobic --
0 son, which is my father is also elderly, and this is one of the reasons why
0 will deal with my grandmother.  She had many sisters, and a couple of them
0 A:  But that's, it's, it's, I'm really glad that I come from an area where, um,
0 to, you know, I have to put my foot down, where, where my life begins.  I
0 A:  And, as the years go on, the tow trucks got better, more easier, and he
0 B:  Right.
0 home by air, and you know, you have to really love a pet to spend two hundred
1 [laughter].
1 dogs.
0 school.  And so, uh, this was the only dog that we trained to ride in the

0 A:  Yeah, it's like if, if your father owns a grocery store and you're really
0 you're most likely to do better in school.  They're going to help you.

0 has to control everything and from her readings she feels that that comes from
0 what I'm going to do to make her be that way and then I think, no you can't do
0 the time establishing a business --
0 A:  -- and their children.  I just, you know, of course, everything wasn't

0 up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with, and
0 B:  Well, you bet.
0 B:  Yes, that's the, the major issue, I guess (( )).

0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Well,
0 A:  #No,# I wish I did.
0 sit around and tinker with that most of the time.
0 A:  So, you know, they, I, I, I know that's bad, but, you know, just like Texas
0 A:  Oh [laughter].  No wonder you don't know that.
0 A:  Why was, you know, why --
1 A:  Well, when you decide to.
0 A:  -- a two forty S X.  But even though I love the car I've got now, I think
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Well, it's very easy when you get a top-, you get on a topic that, you
0 or one mil.  It's kind of difficult to have its metric equivalent --
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  But I, I, I don't know, I think I would [noise] say that if they put it
0 of, you know, but how, you know, it's just so hard [laughter] it's just so
0 A:  I think the,
0 own army is going to eventually turn on him because and, and, you se-, this
1 A:  Oh, golly! [Laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.  We have a little bit and we've just gotten one of those little

0 #((Yeah)).#
1 A:  No joke [laughter].
0 A:  [Cough].
0 A:  And then one night we were camping and it came, just a torrential downpour.

1 B:  I know, I know, (( )) they.
0 B:  -- um, and the furthest away I've talked to someone has been New York.
0 where the people who are really sick, you know --
0 B:  Right (( )),
1 just shun all responsibilities of any kind,
0 mother in law just visited.  She's just about seventy-five.  Again, perfectly
0 A:  -- rather than, well, it's easy to say, Oh, yeah, let's put these old folks
0 B:  That's neat.
0 B:  I know, bless their hearts, you hate to hurt them by doing that, that's --
0 A:  Oh, he still drives?
1 A:  Well, everybody needs retraining.  It doesn't hurt, uh,
0 have a refresher course and then take another driving.
1 Um.
0 A:  Oh really.  I dated, uh, I dated a nice Jewish girl for many years up in
0 too.
1 A:  Well, I took piano lessons in fourth grade once for,
0 um, comedy abilities.
1 events free [laughter].
1 before I even had a stereo to play them on, to play them on.
0 A:  I ended up winning about, uh, two hundred and thirty radio contests in two
1 B:  Yeah -- 
1 A:  Uh, very good videos, yeah, I'm kind of impressed [laughter].
0 B:  I, I was thinking that.  Yeah, he's, his videos are pretty wild.  I like
0 A:  Well, what station plays that type of music?
0 somewhat of a threat given that they have, that there's just, it's just so
0 B:  But I, I agree right now they're not, I don't believe they're a large
0 decided, well, I'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  I guess as long as, uh, they're fighting each other, we don't have to worry
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 course --
1 that'll do any good.
0 grandmother's diamonds in it, that I had made, and it was worth close to two
0 Field.  I'm not sure.  She's around there somewhere.  She just got her a new

0 we've, we had to get rid of her.
0 been very, uh, very good parents.
1 leather gloves and my father still wondered what happened to those leather
1 gloves [laughter].
0 B:  you plan it, but that's where you get the money is,
0 out of that,
0 A:  So,
0 in the auditorium,
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  I di-,
0 A:  you know, it's really a, not,  
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 wheel drive vehicle, you sit and spin.
1 A:  Well, this is Texas it doesn't set, it blows.
0 A:  Gives,
0 B:  Uh.
0 I think there needs to be a concerted effort, you know, say, okay, here's a
0 the other group but they can be but they're not sensitive on the bottom line
0 think that one or two years out of my life would have, probably like you said,
0 look forward to and,
0 the sense, that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner
0 B:  And, um, you know, although I wouldn't want it (( )) to make people to go
0 A:  No, I haven't.
0 a fourteen year old --
0 out greatly below his actual age.  And, of course, Sally, uh, isn't a very big
0 B:  I don't know if your on city water, city water has chlorine in it,
0 when people had gone to war before,
0 A:  I know that, uh, I've heard people say that you know when people that
0 B:  everything, superperson [laughter].    
0 B:  whereas before that never would have happened [laughter], 
0 B:  So, that's kind of a difference for us.  I think there's more pressure to,
0 B:  #But there's so many more people,#
1 B:  And now we're kind of like in Lewisville, Miss White Little suburbia,
1 that,
0 B:  to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds.  We
1 got invited to, one guy practically roasted a goat in his, in his dorm
0 B:  Is it?
0 A:  Um, uh, I don't think it's for kids.  He's, he,
0 A:  Well,
1 [laughter].
1 channels, so.  But, yeah, that's my, about my favorite, so.  [noise].
0 B:  Well, it's been nice talking to you,  
1 can't wait until I'm old enough so I don't have to do this anymore.
1 without working in it.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  But, um, I don't know, I've, I, I just prefer having someone else do it, to
1 B:  He made us do the grunt work. 
0 B:  You, did you have any problem with bugs or anything like that?
1 A:  but we didn't do it right. 
0 B:  Bye-bye.
0 B:  Yes.
1 mouth.
0 B:  Oh.
0 dishes are, and, cleaned in the kitchen and,
0 A:  And then maybe somehow turn what ever negatives around into a positive.
0 A:  -- things like that.
0 B:  I see.
0 B:  have children?  Do you have children at home? 
0 B:  -- shows.  And I like mysteries,
0 B:  It was probably in the fifties but there was a little strong wind.
1 off.
0 B:  That's true.  
0 A:  Yeah, it is.  We've got, um, if I take half a day off during the summertime
0 A:  And they're just a few in the country that even have this type of training
0 B:  Oh, really.
0 B:  And, well, they don't call it remedial reading these days,
1 A:  Well, that's a nice way of putting it.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  you can, you can have the best school system in the world if you don't
0 when [throat_clearing] some people first tried that and they got sued.
1 [laughter].
0 that and then take, cutback a little bit on some, uh, other area --
0 A:  Yeah.
1 many, uh, I'm a supervisor and, I (( )), I (( )) the thing,
1 B:  Um.  Uh-huh.
0 A:  That, I think that was the most difficult thing for people to pick up on
0 B:  Speaking of, uh, let's see big corporate benefits, I wonder if, uh, I
0 smaller companies that don't want to have all the payroll hassle and
0 think, I think, I think we left most of it because it gets to be, uh, they
0 A:  Yeah, that was my teenage years.  I was born in fifty and, and, uh,
0 discipline to stay with it, but when I do play, uh, and begin to reacquire
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  uh, especially in, you know I didn't have the money to go to these dinner
0 should just about do it.
1 after a while [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, suburban tract, yeah, we, uh, we lived out of state for
1 Mexi-, I don't, shouldn't say that, I don't have an ethnic maid
0 you know, that maybe --
0 out,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 college and living in apartments there, you know how noisy that
0 B:  Yes, I do.
0 B:  Oh, for goodness sakes, that is, that is just really nice.  We kind of, you
1 A:  -- twenty years, going from, well, take it back, thirty years
0 issue is the children, because as far as housework goes, you
0 B:  -- and, uh.
0 we're losing out on some things, [baby_talking] going back to

1 for sure at that point.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  My fingers always get, get it real bad.  I hate that, I mean,

1 B:  But I'm determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one.

1 B:  You know and then the results come back and no you didn't [laughter]. 
0 B:  So, [sniffing] anyway. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  With two, a two year old and a,
0 A:  Great [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, [lipsmack] they're working on diapers,
0 A:  That's right.
0 really use that many tin cans.  I guess there's some places where you can
0 A:  You know, our church each year has a, one of their major fund raisers is,
0 thing in two or three weeks and of course when you're that age you really
0 B:  [Noise].
0 A:  and eventually disappears. 
0 A:  #You know,# they've got all kinds of automatic weapons, these criminals do.
0 A:  and when I say there's no deterrent, you know, of the death penalty, um,
1 spot, you know,
0 A:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  Ye-, i-, yeah, I wouldn't want to see it go that far,
1 B:  Well, let's see, well, we assume I was an adult twenty years ago,
0 war, and, uh, bring our troops home and things were, more organized.
0 you know, some real landmark bills passing and things like that.  Such that,
0 option of whether you want a jury or not.
1 A:  Yeah, that would be ((wrongful)). 
0 you know, that's,
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 I'll go play around for a while.
0 A:  for the computer to find somebody. 
0 B:  So, I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it. 
0 A:  Oh, you don't? 
0 A:  Yeah.
0 six weeks after I had been working here and I asked about, you know, day care
0 A:  Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not, it's not excessively
0 B:  Is expensive, uh-huh.
0 paying for, at least in my neck of the woods, uh, we do that kind of
0 wouldn't start.  So gave it a, somebody came along and helped give it a little
1 A:  No, it's just as boring.
0 A:  -- than on the other.
0 A:  -- and they made copies of it.  
1 A:  No, I'm trying not to.  He's telling me to start the grill. 
0 goes up to F.  So I thought that was somewhere around nine.  But anyway, it's
1 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, right, each one of those puts on a few pounds, doesn't it.
0 B:  Oh, well.
0 B:  [Laughter] No, I, well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is
0 and all that stuff.
0 A:  Huh.
0 and slicing, I just, I was topping the ball, I was, you know, I was doing a
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, that's, that's exactly what my friend has, has figured out
0 nothing like what it used to be.
0 A:  Yeah.

0 B:  -- Amer-, Ex,  yeah.  I, I don't know if it's easy for them to get or, or,
0 B:  Oh gee, oh gee, oh gee.
1 A:  No, it doesn't.
0 they're real-, they sacrificing something too.  It seems the credit card
1 A:  Should own stock.
0 college, the credit card people like to get you, because they spend, they use
1 last place you went out to eat?
0 B:  Well, our, our kids are a little older.  Actually we got a seventeen year
1 find a (( )), and I said it's the toy, uh, uh, the play yard out in the front
0 can, uh, sit down and relax and be able to watch them too.
0 B:  Well, when, it's funny, when the-, when the-, when the kids get a lot
1 then they learned to say no.
1 A:  and flower beds or even gardens, that, we're just saying, let's get some
0 [child] St. Augustine that we had.  It had held onto a small portion, but
0 B:  Okay, Plano.  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Um.
0 A:  There are some oaks, magnolias, and like plum trees, peach trees, there are
0 A:  And plus, it's illegal, you know, in warfare or any other kind of, uh,
0 civilians and, and, um, anti Hussein troops with the gun ships.
0 more so.  It's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much,
1 A:  It's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 of have a liberal political slant, and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly
1 A:  That was like, oh boy, they are so messy when they're little, too
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Really [laughter].
1 A:  No that's true.  That's funny.
1 B:  So first thing I think of is how easy would this,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 B:  Oh [laughter].
0 A:  I'm ready for a new car myself, but I've had this car for eleven years, and
0 change, and you charged me thirty dollars.  And the guy says, well, yeah, but
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  Hm.  Well, I, I, you know.  It's just a, that's the biggest
0 necessity in business and so forth, I, I try to refrain from their use as much
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  But, uh, for hotels and, and so forth.  But, uh, but I knew that it was
0 American Express credit card --
1 A:  Oh really.  
0 B:  #Yeah, is a# Taurus.
0 B:  I know how that go.  But, I guess that's about it, and I better let you go.
1 B:  Boy, you're, you're right up there about where I am.
0 we have some hills.  Uh, for the most part, we all use carts, uh, battery
0 inexpensive course to get on.
0 play more last year, of course, but we were gone a lot too.
1 outsider's point of view.

0 being independent.
0 A:  They're four and five. 
0 they eat more and, 
0 it unscrews and --
0 B:  -- continually, you know, but I do not have one of my own at home.

1 A:  [/Laughter].
0 A:  Was that the animated version?
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 mostly centered upon his abilities to --
0 B:  Chop them up, huh?
1 who got, who became a widow because he was selling drugs [laughter],
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  They're supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm
0 B:  Oh, yeah.  In fact, I think that's, that's one of the big problems today is
0 disinterested in what's going #on in the class and disruptive.#
0 A:  -- it's like day and night.  And I wonder, how do they handle a child who
0 A:  And, you know, they can get a, they can grasp the points.  Can they convey
0 A:  You know, it does make me nervous.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And I suspect somebody had just had him and moved on.
1 B:  And so after she had chewed up my, my redwood furniture --
0 B:  I bet it likes chicken, though.
0 B:  Well, the thing is th-, that a lot of those are, like they're set up
0 A:  And, yes, I do.  And the reason I do is because, um, I've, with, uh,
0 the whole Leninist,
0 A:  So anyway, so this is kind of one of my little pet babies, but [laughter]
0 B:  of that --
0 A:  Have they made a world apology?  We, we repented for (( )).  We're going
0 B:  ((Yeah)).
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Well, I, I don't know, I've never been to any, [clanging] a game or
0 B:  watching the Super Bowl last year because the, the Giants' coach looks like
0 we do now and move on.
1 B:  All right [laughter].
0 A:  Oh.
0 A:  No, huh-uh.
0 B:  It was good talking to you.  I don't think we've gone our, our ten minutes
0 B:  Yes, living under a bridge so to speak.
0 don't know about this day and time when there's so many people out of work.  I
0 A:  -- you know, [laughter] because it's pretty scary when you own a home and,
1 because I'm, I'm too old for it now.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 or something.
1 A:  Yeah.  You never know what's in the water, either [laughter].
1 what am I going to do,
0 still going around,
0 A:  #But see, but you're going there# and you know what you're getting into.
0 A:  From, from, uh, one to a thousand.
0 B:  So it's, it's no, is it not educational training?  It's st-, it's strictly,
1 physical training,
0 A:  And, uh,
0 B:  Oh, #you get a, little benefits?#
1 A:  ((It's like)) please let me ride for free.
1 which I have to do.
0 A:  I don't know, fifteen years or more, and I got so sick of it, trying to
1 B:  think that comes from never having enough.  You know, I'm always afraid
0 B:  and so now that I've gotten, you know, I lost the house.  Now that I've
0 him.  I, uh, you know, I, uh, he didn't have a chance here in Dallas because,
0 A:  Uh, yeah, except I don't use them.  Uh, [laughter] then what happened, so
1 and Hunt got together and flipped a coin and the loser had to stay [laughter].
0 me every year and says, can I have the tickets one more year?  I say yeah,
0 contract, they won't draft them.
0 A:  three there next September, uh, I, you know, I'm going to watch them on
0 A:  Yeah, but you know, it's, it's interesting because old, uh, uh, you know
0 off most of the time, but nevertheless, in, in over three or four seasons,
0 closed their borders --
0 strict,
0 B:  I don't even think that will help right now because you never know who's on
0 A:  And see that bothers me.  I'm, I'm a, I mean, I'm, I'm very much for drug
0 B:  -- that protect.  I'm not sure, though, when we talk about what rules, if
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 no stress on the joints.
0 uh, excellent design, you know, top rated pool.
0 A:  Well, the reason I ask you, I, I'm a TI employee and, uh, we have a fitness
0 A:  -- that makes it real, real convenient because I tend to find that once I
0 up down, do different variations, you know, change feet and, and you'd be
0 A:  Yeah, we have one of those, too, but it's boring.
0 know, every now and then, when I do check up and say where is my count, I
1 B:  Well, I've, I've lost most of my hair so that's no real problem [laughter].
1 B:  Then nobody really complains if I, uh, if I come in sort of half wet.
0 B:  Almost every day.
0 B:  -- and, uh, she, she twisted,
1 us, I really don't.
0 B:  -- you know, through the fall, but, uh, down here, well, it's done both
0 A:  My sister does, uh, flower gardens.  She gets right into it.
0 They're really,
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, I, I have another thing that I thought about too, for
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  He, he almost wishes that, that he could have gone home. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 version or vision or whatever the United States, now, is somewhat changed in
0 A:  And then other times we jump in and do things and while I'm glad that they,
0 B:  Which is, seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment.
1 A:  Well, I guess I better go I have a repairman just came,
0 B:  I said, I sometimes I wish I had more space --
0 B:  Yeah.  They, they just run all over,
0 B:  The basics. 
1 B:  and keep them watered and I, I don't think I'll do it again [laughter].
0 A:  I, this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system,
0 I really need to get out, you know, and apply something, you know, and I screw
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  You're, you're making me hungry here. 
0 A:  They have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something.
0 B:  So, because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store? 
0 B:  Are you?  
0 fantastic machine needless to say so I'm very, uh, high on it.  But you said
0 In-, incidently Bauch and Lomb uses it too.
0 hard disk to the floppy and the C P U goes off and does something else because
0 B:  Sure.  
1 [laughter].  But there's a,
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].  That's what I wish I had [laughter].  But in our family
1 B:  and terrible just, just to, um, make sure that they didn't have to do it
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Maybe,
1 A:  -- but, um, I usually try to stay out of the kitchen.  I don't know
1 she cooks everything with alcohol but [laughter],
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  Have to impress the boss [laughter] --
0 A:  But, uh, [smack] so, is there anything else.
0 B:  Oh, three nights, I worked on it three nights, and about four hours on last
0 uh, chain and the labor --
1 to talk with you folks from, from down in the the main office area,
0 B:  Does that make a difference to you?   
0 B:  With the lady being thrown out -- 
0 shoulder harness --
0 A:  that's it.  Uh, [lipsmack] shoot I can't even think of the name of it now.
0 and you know --
0 A:  well, see that's the reason we couldn't make, really make them, at first
0 A:  Well, you, you too.   
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 in a while, for however much poundage you've got.  And if you keep feeding it
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well they're certain places, you know, where down there you can
1 B:  I don't know.  I'm trying but,
1 I'm not that European [laughter].
1 A:  No, I never really thought about it [laughter].
0 B:  No.
0 B:  -- we take off on.  
0 over to the fitness center.
0 B:  [Laughter]
1 was like a bad comedy show [laughter].
1 A:  Because I got up and started jumping on it again.
0 B:  Yeah, they had, well they had to go in and do surgery.  They put a pin in
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 maybe that's a handicap access, and then I said no,
1 A:  [Laughter]  Yeah but,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 uh, I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to
1 A:  An-, you know, I do like to have my guns.  
0 A:  [Child_talking] I've never heard of anything like that.  
0 B:  So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club.
0 B:  I think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose.  In fact, I'd like
1 B:  #[Laughter].#
1 A:  -- this, my kid is jumping on me.  I can't hardly talk.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  No.  I don't either.  I can, I can buy some, uh, today if I wanted to.
1 the money, so I can't complain too much.
0 really interesting.
0 question.  We don't get to go that often, but something on the tip of my
0 A:  The last, uh, in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw --
1 moments,
0 about a month ago.  So, I, I, I've seen it the second time not too long ago.
0 A:  -- it's just, I mean, uh, it's incredible.
0 B:  Yeah, and I heard the video's even going to be longer.
1 miss it, for a week or two.  You feel kind of left out [laughter].
0 apartment and got cable, and I guess I sort of, kind of became numb.
1 A:  Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V, you know.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  In fact, it's, I think it's on tonight [laughter].
0 B:  It's funny now, and it's better, but it's real different --
0 would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs.  And I think that's what
0 had, when we sent temporaries to T I, we had to have their drug tested.
0 B:  So yeah, I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that.
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start
0 B:  No not yet, we're expecting a baby --
0 hover at a hundred fifty, and I'm six one, so --
0 A:  or is something wrong with it but --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- and, uh, that they required you to do.  And I took it to Town North, and
1 A:  Yeah, and then, oh, they do ride nice, too.
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah, got to see them all the time.
1 A:  So I decided, no matter what, if I had to let a bill go,
0 I'm real pleased with it.  I have no, no qualms about, and I wouldn't mind
0 the service when I was eighteen,
0 A:  Yeah, uh, did a lot of growing up.
0 A:  Sure.
0 bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,
0 can't read --
0 B:  Yeah, #oh yeah.#
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 to retire and go to work for him.
0 something like that.
0 A:  Again, I mean, people think it's expensive, but you, my goodness state
1 B:  And he had to get two new ones, too,  
1 we've got some good news and we've got some bad news,
0 B:  All that scheduled maintenance ((right)).
1 A:  Oh, Lord [laughter].  
1 me for the rest of my life with this jack attached,
0 warms up)).
1 B:  Yeah, we, we have, we have a dog and that's just about as bad as a kid
1 heavy and they were all, everybody was trying to flee the campsite,
0 B:  because everything that T I did anyway we, we shipped in and it was
0 course, there's a yearly fee on.
1 something,
0 A:  It's never quite made sense to me, but then, uh, when my husband was in
0 A:  was going to catch up with him but,
1 A:  I was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing.
0 card almost exclusively.  But now they're charging the extra five cents to use
0 B:  (( )) the banks don't want to hear from us because they want those people
0 B:  and, and then get all, yeah, and then pay fifty dollars a month and it all
1 A:  That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?  [laughter]. 
0 A:  Well, you know, uh, now he-, here's something that, uh, first occurred to
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  Uh, uh, uh, certainly those, those records are available,
0 B:  Well, I do, I do realize that, uh, uh, the Bush Administration isn't too
1 [breathing] you know, he's a tough guy, I mean, he's been through it
0 more blatant about it, but it's very secret, and it's been going on for years.
0 B:  That's right. 
0 involved is the, the reports that I hear back and of course on the news I try
0 to have to repay Israel for all the bombing that we did that was in there, you
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 the kids are dirty and,
0 surgery,
0 is?  [Laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, th-, we got these people up in Washington deciding all
0 this stuff for us, and we don't even know what they're deciding.  So it's.
0 leadership in our society.
0 B:  No, no I don't, I just,
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  I know it just --
1 B:  and if it's not nice and they can't go out, it's really the pits
0 the backyard.  So, I'm hoping, you know, that, it just seems like the weather
1 A:  You know, so you're going do I want a di-, a green lawn or a muddy feet
1 B:  Oh, yeah, because Houston was really hurricane alley, wasn't it,
1 A:  hurricanes, so, 
0 A:  -- with a flood gauge down the street. 
0 B:  make the system so it goes completely throughout the, the Bay area,
0 A:  Right.
0 standards and certain goals and really to push it and, uh, let the
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 I, I think no one can doubt the fact that it is, you know, I mean it's a bad
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Well,
0 am very much in favor of the types programs we're having in our schools here
0 touch with, of course, Texas Rangers being one of them, I mean, uh, you know,
0 means the Rangers are going to have a terrible year, I, uh,
0 but I mean, you know, the strike outs were a big problem for him, and, uh,
0 doesn't guarantee you, uh, winning a pennant.
1 for, for what, you know.
0 A:  I couldn't believe that.
0 think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't
0 B:  You know, and I don't think any politician's going to do that, so.
0 B:  Exactly.  And, you know, it's going to really hurt the, the middle class,
0 B:  Which state park? 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  can usually get up, and, uh, but, uh, and then so we're, when we're in
0 A:  Right.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
0 with two N -s and an E?
0 B:  Um, what, uh, how do you feel about, uh, 
1 A:  Thirty something [laughter].
0 think that things that your talking about like anything that emphasizes the
0 A:  So, it sounds like we're in agreement with that.
1 B:  Um, I don't know, it's so old.  It's one of,
1 they're into so many different things, so.
0 A:  Yeah.  Boy I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  You haven't?
1 reading you've been doing, or do you, have you read any good novels lately?
1 A:  -- just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with.
0 that you'll, you'll read one novel in the next six months, just for you.
0 B:  Yeah, well, the utilities are pretty much, you can pretty much figure what
0 have quintupled, at least.  So there is a real family budget.
0 year.  But when I moved to the new town I live in, because it's a different
0 B:  (( )) they have no fault in Maryland also.
0 B:  -- what to do with the money that you save.
0 B:  -- yeah, but if you are, they withdraw that from your pay, and, uh, you
0 with children in school are very concerned --
0 B:  I do a little bit of woodworking, well, I used to.  I don't have the
0 B:  I've got a few plants here, but I'm not really knowledgeable.  I feel real
0 A:  They just need a yard.  Cats can deal with being inside all the time just
1 definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know
0 work on, and then for the house, I don't have anything, uh, not that I
1 when I,
1 probably have never been in, noticed how wonderful it might be.
0 B:  and get them the next morning.  But they would have run an hour and a
1 their money and so many communities have, uh, have to have that for farming
0 B:  That's right.  Our own hemisphere, but we've, that's been, uh, that's been
1 B:  What time should we be there?  [laughter].
1 [cough] [static].
0 B:  and I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a
0 A:  [Laughter] I got it at the Checkbook Store.
0 A:  we don't have a boat, we usually fish off the shore or off the dock, and
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 catfish and got them.  And I think it's the first time that he's ever, that
0 last year,
0 B:  Well, I think, I think, uh, the best thing to do is, I've got two Masters
0 can't think of what it is.
0 send me some. Well, this year they sent me the test panel thing,
0 pink, one that's going to be white, no, I take it back, one that's going to be
0 A:  Well, that is really neat.  I'd enjoy doing something like that.  You must
0 B:  So, if, if you're looking, you know, plant [noise] some of your, uh, your
0 take off the plastic bag, you'll see leaves coming out and, uh --
0 B:  Yeah, it works great, you know, I've got, and my problem is I've got more
0 B:  Um, I, uh, it, it's funny, it's both of us then were really just
0 A:  or something like that, or whatever, mid-wife or whatever they call it that
0 B:  Yeah, the pro,
0 B:  with Larry Bird back, uh, you can never count the Celtics out #when Larry
1 B:  Oh, boy, what a good job he had [laughter].
0 A:  I know, and I, when I, of course I'm in facilities, and I work with a lot
1 A:  Uh, well that's good.
0 uh, weekends and nights now.  I'm, I'm one of the manager reps, there's three
0 ===========================================================================
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  #You know, how can you help# depending on the day care center, you know,
0 where the mother and the daughter and the son run it, you know, #kind of
0 B:  Yeah.
0 because I, uh, you know I just couldn't wait to have kids and so, if I was, I
1 A:  to be called that, [laughter] care provider.
1 that [laughter].
0 A:  and, you know the Sizzler's real nice because you get the, you know, you
1 A:  Uh-huh, yeah.
0 B:  Uh.
0 B:  Yeah, well it's, it's hard to get out of jury duty, I mean, it's, uh, it's
0 women's nostrils and down her throat and strangled her.  
0 A:  #among them#, yeah, among them cocaine, right, so they split.  Anyway
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Well, there's been all kinds of talk about it but quite honestly, I don't
0 appointed lawyer doesn't have the time or the resources to do as much, but on
1 A:  you having been ten once,
1 A:  With every passing day we wonder if we will be.
0 A:  {pause} And, entirely too much time is spent, my wife and I were wondering
0 hunting and fishing and I said, well, you can take a little girl hunting and
1 A:  Fathers don't even like malls, they despise shopping.
1 least once or, or have some they can borrow for a time,
0 A:  and, it, it's funny, it's almost like a lot of things that were available
1 or, uh, Disney Land, or God forbid, Disney World, would take forever.
0 week with a special section, we, and we pay it sort of glancing nod.  We, uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  So, anyway, back to the original question.  I really think I, if, if we
0 A:  Yeah.
0 all.
1 up in a church because,
0 A:  Now if there was a sickness or something like that, I mean, you know,
0 A:  then, they sent their little things to us.
0 B:  What about the mini skirt?
0 B:  There are some that are really short and then there are some that may be
0 B:  That's good.
0 B:  It is.   Well I happen to drive that one just because I think it looks nice
0 A:  [Laughter] No, I've been, uh, leaning more towards looking at, uh, Mercedes
0 having better gas mileage too.
0 B:  That's what I did, is I kind of did a little bit of both.  Blue book is
0 A:  It, uh, well it's, it's more like an economy car and, uh,
0 B:  Oh, man.
1 little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard,
0 A:   Yeah.
0 A:  It, it was nice going up there and see that scenery.
1 side and, and, uh,
1 camping trips, it, the coldest Easter ever.
0 anymore, we, our kids are pretty near grown,
0 B:  New Braunfels.
0 River.
0 B:  father is.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  #Yeah.#
1 A:  #Right.# Right.  And, if you have to have it in a hurry, something's wrong
0 A:  That's right,
0 interview them about the gun control laws [lipsmack] and, uh, the police said,
0 I was single, it was one thing and when I was just married with no kids,
0 know, what, how can you even afford to, to think about what, what you're going
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 plastic dishes on a counter.
0 A:  [Noise] You know, I can barely hear you [/noise].
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 trying to guess at the end of the show, you know, and they always have the
0 A:  [Lipsmack] I was just going to say, 
0 thought she had done it, you know, because it just looked so obvious that she
0 A:  Right, well, that's it.  I, but I have gotten, we have cable and so --
0 A:  [Laughter] But uh, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 this out [laughter].
0 ===========================================================================
1 there, [breathing] and he said, Oh, it's going to be just about four hours.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  It took four days. 
1 painted French doors, which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do
1 it in a day.  Oh, right.  [laughter] so the whole project basically took a
1 A:  Funny.  And I go what makes you a professional?  [laughter] You know?
0 B:  [Noise] Um. 
0 doesn't guarantee anything [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, boy.  
1 A:  Well, maybe there are some professionals out there [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 have anywhere close to that is Taco Bell.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 the fire but,
0 A:  Oh, yeah, it's, it's, uh, around the corner. 
0 A:  [Breathing] Uh, you know, there's something funny that I haven't really
0 in changing the oil, I guess, that's, uh, I don't even know, a nine-sixteenths
0 A:  I don't know if, uh,
1 A:  I'm getting enthusiastic because they, they're having so much fun, you
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 any more engineers,
0 do a lot of spending cuts instead a lot of raising taxes because that's what's
0 B:  Yeah I think a lot of people fail to realize but, you know, the
0 at least it shouldn't but it seems to in government.
0 B:  but the government, I think is supposed to be doing is, is defending our

0 B:  -- was so real.  #It's like, [laughter] I mean it just# --
1 noises# --

0 ROCKY was going to do, you know.
1 A:  Never sho-, any, anyway, anything that I ever wanted, I rented a lot of
1 A:  But, you know, critically acclaimed.  Oh, good grief.  Give me a break.  
0 saying if you get on the bus to ride between school and day care you'll pay
0 uh, worker areas, how well that's closed off or how not well that's closed off
0 A:  uh, once you get over all the other hurdles just the economics of it, uh,
0 A:  So, it's, it's gotten, it's changed a little bit over the years, but, uh,
0 A:  and plus they, they tend to just shift around in, in who runs them for a
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  #Ah.  Ah, my, I got# my mom a #teacup ((little mutt)),#
0 B:  grant you with you their presence, #you know.#
0 because, uh, she knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good
1 A:  -- when she was younger, she used to do that to get even with me,
0 up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog
1 all over.
1 plus the burial expenses.
0 seventies.  And, uh, the cat, uh, although it's a little bit of work for them
0 A:  Okay.  What is that sound?
0 B:  -- uh, and what it really means [clicking] to vote and [barking] we also
0 #you# --
0 B:  So, it's, it's always nice to see people that like each other, [laughter]
0 mean a male cats are, are re-, you know, real territorial and so that's the
1 A:  I haven't gone that far.  I'm not that bonkers.
1 meanest person [laughter].
0 going to be the last, I think we're going to demolish it [laughter].  We've
0 B:  What division are you in? 
0 B:  It's not a hobby, you know, it's something to do.  I get to here about
1 of people that get shot with guns by equally mentally deranged people,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh, no.  
0 long-term goal is to, to get out of debt,
1 things, uh, we don't have a lot of, uh, you know, like J C Penny's in our
0 mother-in-law lives, uh, not too far from here, so she helps with our son's
0 B:  Then maybe we'll go for a week or two, and, or a month or two, and then the
0 vacation because, uh, I wouldn't make any overtime in two weeks, so, that
0 A:  Wow.
1 B:  Now, I don't know how the dog has fared, eating all that plastic,
1 B:  I mean, even the do-, it wasn't even worth a dollar [laughter].
0 hey, you know, I've really got to go see this movie, and now that it's been
0 cheaper to pay a dollar to see it than to, you know, to pay,
1 [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 daughter had a, ((like a)) little goldfish,
0 dollars, which he did and then, he did it and, so, I guess, uh, he's been
1 crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car
0 the emission test, so.  You know, I had to do that job, and of course, that
0 doing with my time.  And I have the same problem, I mean, you can tell him
0 B:  ((Uh-huh)) Yes.  
0 B:  Uh, I trained my, uh, my wife in the hou-, in, in doing things, in fact,
1 own oil and filter but I got tired of that, so, I let somebody else do it
0 [laughter].
0 B:  It was some belts. 
0 excuse for that, you know.
0 B:  And we have I, my girlfriend used to, uh, be in the Navy and she was based,
0 B:  It is having a good moral background. And it's funny you mention Costa
0 lot of those, those you know, generational things I think, that God sees I'm
0 B:  Do you kind of continue, call this like, a part of savings account or a
0 A:  It's all part of the savings account.  We just keep track of it on paper.
0 do that, so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does
1 A:  Oh, and it's not deductible anymore. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 we don't, we still have fun on things [laughter].
1 one and four [laughter].
1 B:  Put more, yeah, put more cat hair in my disc drive. 
1 follows you from room to room.
0 B:  We're going to breed her with a champion, so we'll be able to get probably
1 [laughter], but we just have to talk about exercise so.
1 A:  and all sorts of things that I don't think, you know, we typically do.
1 B:  and I said "you can walk off your lunch."
1 A:  [Laughter]  That's the way to do it.  
1 A:  and, I'll go for like two weeks and go, this is for the birds,
0 that's where I actually get my exercise,
0 A:  Take care, talk to you later.
1 A:  [Laughter]
0 cookbooks, uh, BETTY CROCKER and NEW YORK TIMESs and,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  No.
0 A:  We went to the playoffs.
1 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  people even wanting to play on their team.
0 tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays.  So I missed a lot of Sundays during
0 A:  Um.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 no.  And one, uh, [lipsmack] I can't remember.  It was about, uh, it was right
0 A:  to fight to get money to, 
0 A:  homeless here.
0 it,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 right?
0 B:  Well, something's going to have to change.  But you look at the Congress
0 you know, that they got AIDS.  But then all you have to do is make sure
0 B:  Okay.  But you can't find no jobs like that.
0 A:  Well, you know, I don't know if #you kn-,# ...
0 countries.
0 A:  #Anyway, but, but do you think,# but the thing is, d-, if they put a

0 B:  That if the, the laws, and, and were, were harsher and were enforced,
0 B:  But, but that's one reason I, uh, I've had no problems with my Subaru,
1 B:  Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody el-, [laughter].
0 A:  They're a lot, I don't like the new style, like of the Toyota van,
0 A:  is what it, something like that, but I used to really like the looks of
0 else except in a desert.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 Colorado and the Grand Canyon area.  {Very faint} I don't know, don't know
0 it [laughter] it's really bad.  Yeah, there's some new shows that I sort of

1 B:  [Laughter].
0 announced that, uh, the drug testing program,
0 to rule it out.
0 human resource folks.
0 A:  it's, it's up to the person [laughter]. 
0 A:  Oh, how old?
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  you know, they just make it look so, easy,
0 B:  but I know it, I'm smart enough to know that it's not quite that easy.

0 all the clocks, and, you know, the, when we take things to be calibrated and
1 I'm not a native Texan, but I love Texas.  So, I wasn't happy till I got back
0 A:  Well, the first, uh, episode started out pretty slow [laughter],  but after
0 B:  We've covered a lot of them. 
0 B:  Oh.

0 A:  Oh, yeah [laughter].
0 even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things

0 last year. 
0 B:  Supervision.

1 that bad.  I'm like, yeah, right, that's why you jumped [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah I do, too.  I, uh, oh, what was it? Um, the ones about, um, Von

0 ago, um, in terms in how many people were interested in having a, a pick up, I
0 B:  So they're really going at it, and I think it's marvelous because,
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 think it's in Canada they're using, oh, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk
0 B:  I don't think I can keep my own garbage.  I mean, I might not have that
0 A:  Yeah (( )).
0 huh, you know that, that was immediately what clicked in my head.  What do I
0 B:  Oh, yeah. 
0 were on farms I guess, or they worked in factories.  At least in the east you
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  So you think our, our, uh, values have to come down to dollars and cents
0 to fit the crime, doesn't it?
1 A:  Yeah.  Of course also believe in deportation but that's another subject,
1 B:  On an island so far away there's no chance they can ever get off
1 B:  So am I.  In building, which building?
0 B:  -- that's the time to go. 
0 B:  Yeah, we went up to Wyoming this last, uh, Summer during that time.  And it
0 B:  Well, that's, that's the even, even farther away. 
0 A:  That's right, and --
0 of, uh, tiny, tiny pebbles.  You know, really small, you know.  But this was,
0 A:  Finally I got home and found out my property was okay. 
0 B:  Right, another belt line, just, uh, farther out. 
0 B:  Oh.
0 B:  It's mostly just the tunes.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 Carolina.  I was just curious. 
0 @B:  Oh, okay.  Um, well the subject we're supposed to be talking about, let's
1 gets that chore, and you,
1 said, Oh, I'm looking forward to a nice turkey.  I said, Turkey?
0 B:  If, if you ever get a chance to buy one of those, I think it was, uh,

0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  I just, uh, like you say, I jus-, I just hear too many cases of, of
0 hazardous type of operation.  Drilling oil and gas wells. 
0 contributing to it through drugs or alcohol. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  No, they're not even touching it.
0 guess I can look at it both ways.  And just to play devil's advocate,
0 are struggling to provide for their families,
0 B:  Ac-,
0 teenage boys held up a Taco Bell.  They put four people in a freezer and shot
0 A:  That's right. 
0 A:  But it, it sounds like you are, uh, you know,
0 B:  # and # I get to see, you know, people's, uh, pain and things, and so when
1 was probably wetter than I have been in some time. 
0 B:  Um. 
0 B:  So there's still no big trees in the development.  But the, uh, uh, all,
0 B:  Eighty-nine, okay. 
1 out of money.
0 A:  Um, I'd, I'd prefer it not to be that hot. 
0 A:  -- but the humidity for some strange reason was only nineteen per cent.
0 sure, go ahead, form your own country.
1 A:  -- it upset the neighbors in the apartment complex so I disabled it

0 ought to have their day in court.
0 investigate.  They investigate.  It's great when they're there.  But unless
0 and they're still, you know, only serving six months in prison.  So that's
0 B:  So that's probably something else they could do.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Well I think it was great when they were, you know, like world champs and
0 B:  And that's about nine miles to the east --
0 B:  Right. 
1 B:  Yeah, yeah.  I've, uh, I'm kind of stuck on them right now, I guess.  But,
0 think's going to do me right.

0 A:  I just pushed that in, and I heard it click. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  # to # give up a hamburger.

0 that they just tend to make you, you say, Oh, well, I've have got all I can eat
0 A:  Do you?
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 feel like you've eaten too much. 
0 B:  Yeah.

1 A:  -- and you don't sound like you're that old. 
0 --

0 B:  Uh, when it gets warm, yes. 
1 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  [Laughter] So, well it's been nice talking to you and, uh,
0 really that we have written down for a budget. 
0 for the year, such as any prescriptions, uh, if you wear glasses or contacts,
0 B:  They'll withhold five hundred dollars from your paycheck, uh, broken up
0 B:  in debt, you know. 
0 B:  And to me, I, I try and forget that we even have that. 
0 and think, oh, maybe we'll just go out and buy something with this.
1 A:  Yeah.  I know.  A lot of people do. 
1 B:  # a # lot of folks from Texas, uh, on this thing.  And so it's, it's, it's,
0 A:  and so I probably won't buy another one until I get another job.
0 B:  I don't think they should turn around and say, you know, the government
0 A:  #Yes.#

0 A:  Yeah.
0 you said, is the, are y-, are they going to get the education that's going to
0 the ones who get out and vote, that's what's robbing a poor mother of the p-,
0 on cost, but on cost effectiveness.  So I gue-,
1 A:  ((Well)) I've been through one of those too [laughter].
0 seldom.
0 seen it often from the twin cities, in Texas it's so common to have one of

0 B:  Then you get a, you get a child care exemption, but it's not enough, you
1 B:  I know it.  Or, uh, who cares about the sex life of a tsetse fly?
0 A:  I think is worth spending some money on because the, uh, basic research
0 paying, oh, I think it was about a quarter of our, uh, city budget --
0 A:  And, um, then, then I also limited it to one of each, one MasterCard and
0 A:  Oh.

0 B:  That's it.  They just keep --
0 A:  -- keep in school --

1 um.
0 A:  Yeah, I often wonder about that, I wonder if, if maybe, you know, I, I, I
0 B:  But they're not allowed to do that.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  #And I guess,# I always thought if it was, threatening my personal safety

0 yard around your house now, in Denton?
1 they're going up, so.  But it's, uh, it's great for mowing [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, we have been so grateful for that over the years, because, we, uh,
0 B:  everybody was, you know, talking about rationing water and doing this and
0 uh, that, uh, jet stream is moving, uh, into our area, North Carolina --
0 A:  Hardly ever, unless there's a hurricane or something like that.

0 B:  and, seventy-nine, was more my era.
1 A:  because of all the computers and stuff.  But the seventies got nothing.
1 I mean, nobody cared to name it [laughter].
1 B:  are gone.
1 so,
0 B:  [Laughter] That's true.  Well, except for Vietnam.
1 was pretty bad times.
0 A:  Oh, well, let's see, yeah, okay, we've been talking for seven minutes, so,
0 B:  We're kind of, I was kind of in the middle of supper, but it's not a big
0 A:  Have you all been able to do much as, uh, as a full family these days, all
0 with the kids, you know, he'll, he'll take them out just to be with them.
1 uh, 
0 B:  Yeah, so.
0 it's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road [children_talking].  
0 A:  That's right.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 You know, of course, they have all the little video games and, you know, those
1 A:  That does sound like fun.  Well I've gotten some good ideas from you
0 B:  And, uh, he was a native and had gone to school there,
1 live, an island in the sun, you know.
1 B:  And, uh, it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn't
0 A:  Oh, its, I think, I think everything always sounds more glamorous than it
0 you know,
1 thing to me, oh, it must have been great.
0 B:  I go, oh, it was just a place to live, yeah, I was,
0 A:  Really.  I, I think, I'm not opposed to it but when its, when the time is
1 good [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by.
1 A:  Of course you could annex Cuba, but they wouldn't like that a bit
1 [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh, yeah, he thinks,
1 B:  He was really funny.  Both of the ones I met have been really funny guys.
0 A:  Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his, uh, his family.
0 Central American leaders that, uh, are mostly democratic have done some pretty
0 you get, 
0 B:  It is, it is interesting, that, that, you know we, we look at the
0 B:  Well what's going to be interesting is to the see what the economic impact
0 question is can, uh, can you, can, uh, can a democracy, uh, afford the, it's
0 democracy of a considerable interest.
0 A:  Absolutely.  I don't, it's going to be hard to, um, we, if you, you, that,
0 to encourage, uh, or to make, to make him growing bananas profitable again, I
0 B:  Of course, of course.
1 B:  Yes, very much.
0 B:  Well, they're showing uh, LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment,
1 B:  So,
1 B:  No, no that's true.  I was just thinking that today, he did,
0 look, but uh,
1 B:  [Laughter] I mean the man is sixty-two years old.
0 A:  I don't care [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Oh, what's that about?
1 bed, I have to get up and, and work the next morning.
1 A:  Yeah, yeah, it could be T I -ers, I think, probably are participating more
0 B:  In Maryland, yes.
1 B:  I guess not.  
1 A:  Right.
0 B:  Well, no.  That's, uh, you could interpret it that way.  
0 B:  So that's, you know, you can look at it as though they are saying it's not
0 B:  But, uh, I don't know if there is, there is a time limit on this, 
0 question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.  Uh, I know
0 guess I would favor status quo.  I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it
0 A:  Um, I guess, you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the
0 other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large
0 numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a ((perjuritive)) sense but in
0 are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would
0 state versus a territory.
0 I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  That's interesting because although I tend to be
0 A:  Okay, well thank you very much.
1 A:  Uh, well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes?
0 B:  And, um, [breathing] the, the how I met him was through, uh, the aerobics
0 B:  I'm, I'm an avid aerobics, [breathing] uh, person and just very, very
0 athletic.  Enjoying a th-, you know, uh, anything dealing with sports.
1 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  Is that why you like aerobics classes, because you're
1 B:  So it involves, you know, I, I can't get out to dance all the time and, 
1 A:  Yeah, would that we could [laughter]. 
0 B:  out and about, and it's, it, it's something you can all, like our, we did
1 A:  Well, you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming
1 B:  I'm sorry.  
0 B:  and, I didn't realize that they ha-, were going to reach out to people
1 from,
1 B:  all over the country.  
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 California too well.  But, in urban California it's just, you know, for all I
0 you know, you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or
0 subscribed to, uh, newsletter,
0 into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another, so
0 A:  #yeah, that,# there's a, I, I can say there's a correlation, but I
0 couldn't say which, which caused the other.  They sort of, dev-, you know,
0 sure)) if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, you know, which is
0 sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in
1 B:  #I live in a rural area,# so,
0 A:  I think so.  I mean you, you've, if you look at cert-, if you look at other
1 conscious.  But they, you know, they live to a hundred and ten some
0 A:  and, a lot of that is diet.  That's true.
0 B:  Yeah and as we can see.  Well, I'm a, I'm a practicing vegetarian so, uh,
1 A:  I, as am I.
1 B:  Oh, are you also [laughter],
1 A:  Yes [laughter].
0 A:  Well most, most, mo-, sort of modern looking restaurants will, 
0 changing to a degree, but, um, it's very frustrating.
1 B:  Uh, I think we've been fortunate that we've missed any of the real bad
1 A:  Dust storms.
0 B:  But I haven't seen any like that in probably five or ten years.
0 A:  [Throat_clearing] and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm
0 A:   And, uh, we were feeling very cocky because, of course, we always, in
1 New Hampshire you always have that kind of weather. 
1 B:  I know the sun is coming.
0 start, uh, approaching the fifty degree mark.  And, of course, we've already
0 A:  And I would get up at five o'clock in the morning just to shovel out the
1 A:  And that's so I could leave by seven. 
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 A:  Yes, uh-huh.
1 B:  and it, we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody
1 A:  And, uh, and so I usually, I can usually make it in, it's just a hop,
1 jump, and, uh, uh, whatever the expression is, I'm, I'm real close [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] Hop, skip and a jump.
1 B:  #There you go.#
1 shovel sunshine, you know,
0 B:  Sure, once you're out of the house, you're in the street.
0 extreme to the other and that's, that's been hard to adjust to.  But, uh, the
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 break, you know, when the air's real brisk and the, the colors on the trees
1 are just so vivid, um, uh, it's just, that, that's something I miss.  I, I
0 A:  I, Boston's right on the water and, uh, you'd have these hundred degree
1 you're sweating to death again.
1 on the side, and I also like to, uh, do gardening, and also like to workout.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  or playing with the computer,
0 B:  yeah, well, I, I, uh, I work with computers at work and then I come home
0 them. There's one woman that charged ten dollars a month for fire, all that I
0 A:  [Baby_crying].
1 throwing them and broke them.
0 A:  #I workout with that, uh, E S P N.#
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  I haven't worked out in quite awhile.  I play volleyball, I guess that's
0 I'll be playing again.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  in line, and I don't see how people do that, that drives me batty.
0 B:  [Laughter] Well I, uh, I have a, a, Computer Information Systems degree
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 was the, the Atari, toot toot,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] and you know, that was just a couple lines and you push a button
0 and you hear a train and then the, the toot toot [laughter],
1 A:  if I came in just in jeans or,
0 okay. That's appropriate.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 in a, a suit and to me it ma-, helps me feel sort of like, what you were
0 B:  And, uh, if I do have to approach, the, uh, the controller or the vice
1 A:  And so, for me to dress in businesslike clothes, my, uh, you know, um, I, I
0 preferred slacks because we had to wa-, park pretty far [laughter].
0 A:  and the campus is pretty large,
0 things but,
0 A:  didn't make me have to much trouble and,
0 A:  you know, heavier wools and,
1 A:  or something, rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe
0 B:  Right.
1 A:  acceptable. You know, if you wear, um, pastels, it needs to be warm
0 and so, I guess part of that is, um, just the physics of it.  That, in, what,
1 A:  Huh-uh, right. 
1 husband and I, we don't go to a lot of like where he as to wear [lipsmack]
1 A:  two holidays. 
1 A:  that there, there is a pretty, um, I wouldn't say snobish [laughter].
0 seems like people really dress up a lot more here in North Dallas going to
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 B:  You can't just wear your sweats and an old tee-shirt. 
1 A:  No, [laughter] you can't. 
1 [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] and now that is.
1 A:  It's north of Sherman.
1 B:  Well, you live almost in Oklahoma [laughter].
0 B:  ((Yeah)).  That's kind of ironic, because I don't live too far from
0 Oklahoma either.
0 them go.  Say okay, you're convicted --
1 B:  -- and if they get convicted again, well, just kill them.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
1 thing last night, up in Washington State. If you get convicted of, uh, sexual
0 A:  Um.
0 A:  Um.  So you're, you're kind of thinking, in other words, if you get, if you
0 do something the first time, that's not real bad, you know,
0 really need to face the consequences then, uh.
0 B:  Well, yeah, ((use)) that or, you know, there's other consequences rather
0 B:  You know. 
0 A:  Huh-uh.
1 A:  No, apparently not, because look how many years they've been doing that and
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  Oh, I'm, I agree very much so on that, I, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 building and they work all day, and they go home and they smoke their dope and
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  And, the kids of these people (( )).
1 kid threaten my life,
1 B:  Threaten my life.  Told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death.
0 step into mainstream society or you can die.
0 and I, it really is ((I'm like you)) astonishing what the younger ages know,
0 a personality conflict you just, you worked with it and you got through it.
0 B:  Or, one thing or the other.  You look at another kind of society like the
0 A:  Really, I like cross-stitch too.    
1 B:  Oh, I love it.    
0 B:  Have you been cross-stitching long?    
1 B:  Mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from
1 A:  But, now I don't know.  
1 B:  Yeah.  I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors [laughter].
1 two hundred, and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 forty-two different shades of pink.
1 you don't have much spare time either?
1 B:  And just into everything, so there's not a spare moment.  
1 B:  Right.  
1 A:  He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway [laughter].  
1 B:  Oh, well, that's neat that you like cross-stitching also.   
0 A:  Yeah, that's, that's kind of strange [laughter] that we got the same call.
1 A:  No, that's okay.  
1 going to be in high school before I get finished.
0 B:  -- is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the, with
1 A:  I gave it to her and she said how did you know those are the colors we
1 used.  I said {pause} didn't [laughter].
0 B:  Yes, my, uh, grandmother, um, made us a couple of quilts for the baby, and
1 I was like, oh, I don't want to mess those up.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 walked outside and if you're walking against the wind you almost couldn't move
0 A:  the whole city. 
0 B:  when you get, I mean, here they start even to forecast the weather, you
0 A:  Really?
1 B:  Yeah, they don't even wait around here to see if they canceled it
0 [laughter] they call them,
1 B:  um, it's beautiful the next day.
0 A:  Oh.
1 B:  that, uh, we've had, you know, twelve car pile ups [noise], 
1 B:  No, no.
0 B:  My word.
0 A:  hanging down and, and they're a lot of streets that are just closed
0 every single store in Rochester has been sold out of batteries.
0 B:  You need to stock up to batteries then.
0 A:  a freezer full of food, and that's all been,
0 A:  just, you know, you can't use it.  It's, it's just gone bad.  So, this
0 night, he mentioned the state of emergency and we all felt like finally we
0 A:  Well, throughout all of this I called my in-laws who live in Florida,
0 B:  Oh.
0 pay phone outside of our house, um, they were sitting by the pool sipping, you
0 A:  Oh, was really, it was horrible.
0 A:  I, you know, I guess, you-, your, like the earthquake was in San Francisco?
0 then, you can, you only had, um, two or three months that you could plant a
0 A:  Hi. Today is, uh, Saturday.  Have you found spare time to do any hobbies?
0 uh, bought myself another cactus plant.
0 A:  We have a couple of those too.  We, uh, we haven't planted a garden yet.
0 garden, [barking] but here, I, I don't know, I, I hear, I hear that the
0 A:  That's what we had, yeah, #we just,#
1 A:  Mine has got a flat tire, so I'm going to have to do something about that.
0 B:  Yeah, they go to arts and crafts fairs,
0 B:  -- and they, uh, he turns, turns out bowls and vases of all different types
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 work on that now.
1 A:  All right.
0 B:  No.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And then, when I took, uh, I've seen these kids that, uh, it's a church
0 A:  You know.  And, um, you know, it, uh, I know most of the girls up there and
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- you know, and maybe about four teachers and that's a lot of kids.
0 A:  getting too much for her.  So, I just quit.  I'd rather quit and take
1 A:  You know, they do bad things but they're good kids.
1 B:  Well, you know, kids, kids [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah, I don't either.  It's not until you have kids, I guess, you
1 other I just decided not to face that issue and I just keep them with me.
1 but I've enjoyed talking with you.
0 a good day.
0 A:  All right.  Bye-bye.
0 A:  Okay.  Did it click?
0 something, you know, I, I think of it as something alive, you know.  So, it, I
1 [laughter],
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  So wa-, if you have, if you have people over would you fix all vegetables
0 can make a pizza that's not, that doesn't have any animal produ-, animal, you
0 grocery store and they had lentils and I, you know, I wasn't really sure
0 store will, {rattling noise} you know, the bigger grocery stores.
0 B:  I don't think I even know what a lentil is.
0 A:  Yeah, see that, lot of people don't and that's,
0 B:  Oh, no way.  But I bet it's really, I bet it is healthy because a couple
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  So, when you prepare a meal, like say on Thanksgiving, what do you?
1 A:  No.  Yeah.  You just, you just.  Well,
1 it's for me ethical, we'd just play up the fact that Thanksgiving's, you know,
1 is a time for everyone to give thanks [laughter] even turkey, you know.
0 A:  So, um, but it, it's interesting finding different recipes.  Although, my
0 MOOSEWOOD RESTAURANT, and, uh, it's out of New York, it's a pretty famous
1 taste because I'm, boy, am I a taste person [laughter],
0 things like that, different kinds of diseases, it's like, uh, is it really
0 A:  I think you'd feel probably a lot healthier.  Um, my, almost everyone in my
0 B:  I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good.  
0 A:  Well, why was C N N the only, of course I think, Saddam Hussein only
0 allowed C N N to broadcast it, is that not true?
0 coverage.
0 A:  That's the only thing they broadcast and like you I listened to radio on my
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 in the news.  Um,
1 A:  So then, you wake up one morning and you are in war with somebody you don't
1 A:  Uh, we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS, but I
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  I find it hard to, uh, follow from one page to another.  It's just
0 something I have never developed, uh, an interest in.
1 A:  And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it's
0 A:  They just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the T V, you know
0 B:  But, I grew up in L A. I work out here. 
0 B:  So, I'm in the computer business. 
0 A:  I don't keep up with it that often. 
1 B:  This is my first call.
0 B:  No, no.  I'm in Detroit.  Or not Detroit.  I'm in, uh, California.
0 B:  Yeah.  #((I)).#
1 B:  Oh.  Well, you're on the, uh, let's see,
1 A:  What?  Yeah, yeah.  It's, uh, I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here.
0 B:  Hey.  How do you like it out there [clicking]?
0 B:  No, no.  I go to the, it's the naval postgraduate school out here.
0 A:  doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley [sigh].
0 B:  #[Thumping] Uh-huh.#
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 and,
1 B:  Oh, probably be another twelve years.
0 B:  If they pay for a P H D?
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  -- they said like they got a lot of benefits and that.  That's why you want
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  #But I mean, I mean, you, the,# once you get your Masters, you can be
0 year.
1 B:  No.  Well, it depends on what rank you are, #of course [/barking].# 
0 B:  #Yeah.  Since# I imagine it's fairly #competitive.#
0 which says, you know, it's like, uh, all, all the major companies get into a,
1 row, row, row and one person rowing, right.
1 A:  #So he goes,# have you come up with a -lution, uh, have you come up with a
1 everyone's a,#
0 A:  -- only use like one person does the work so.
0 B:  Too many chiefs and #not enough Indians.#
0 B:  Yeah.  I don't know, that can be, that, that can really slow you down.  
0 It's like, #it's like have you, have# --
0 A:  And so it's like the same thing with I B M.  You know, so they have this
0 is, that I B M is so stabilized that #everybody will buy their stuff.#
0 quit.
0 know, like you're a manager.  So they'll #put# --
0 A:  #Right.#
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, you know, that's, that's a, that's a big #thing.#
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away.
0 last five.  I B M says let's throw it away.  Leading Edge will say we'll buy
0 testing it and it was wonderful.  And then when you tried to erase and
0 B:  #Wow.#
0 it's like, of course it does.  I mean, by the times it transforms into Wave by
1 A:  -- what it is for us to make mark off models, you know.  It's like,
0 B:  Well, when you get, you know, when you get right down to it, the, uh, the
0 B:  #Okay [cough].#
1 A:  Absolutely. 
0 to have to supplement ourselves.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  It's --
0 A:  -- certainly a, a supplemental way, uh, and I suppose if, b-, maybe in, in
0 but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know.
1 I kind of have to trade off, you know.  If you never see it you don't spend
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 start looking for that word guaranteed,
0 have, you know, money for his college.  And that's exactly what we have coming
0 A:  that approach.  That's,
1 B:  That's right.   
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?  And, and our
0 attend a state college.  And if he wants to go to a private college, he can
1 don't know, I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.  And I said,
0 for.  I've always been involved in little small, you know, ind-, privately
0 when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  -- for overtime. 
0 B:  Which is the same, but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,
0 that's,
0 A:  Um, you know, different things, is it restricted to certain crimes?  Or
0 B:  It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get 
0 recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been
0 A:  I just, I can't see that. 
0 A:  [Throat_clearing].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, yeah, oh, absolutely, yeah, it goes on for years and years, and costs
0 A:  Is really kind of bad [child].   
0 (( ))think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have
0 heavily on television and the newspaper.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yes, the other one just seems so terrible.  
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  I think, we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of determ-, deterrent
0 may seem to be the best way out.  I don't know.
0 B:  Yes. 
0 A:  to think about it and,
0 same thing again.  
1 never am, like, like everybody else.
0 got a summons, jury summons,
0 B:  Sure, it's, it's a big responsibility, it really is. 
0 local, uh, my only experience with it, I was in Central America for a while,
0 uh, high school education,
0 B:  I didn't know. 
0 A:  Did you ever get any information on it like,
1 A:  Wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps? 
1 B:  Yeah, I think so, yeah, yeah [laughter].
1 and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all
1 the drugs and violence and sex [laughter] and everything here, and take them
1 don't know which end though.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 understand, from some of the guys I know, you know, crime, uh, is punishable,
0 A:  what we consider street crimes. 
1 great deal of thought, you know,
1 A:  Shoot them. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  I don't know.  Send them over to Iraq [laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, right. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  (( )).
0 B:  That could be a complicated too, couldn't it. 
1 A:  Suppose, uh, well, you know, they had a group who were construction
0 good example, a swimming pool, or anything, you know, and one, you can, you
1 A:  Yeah.  I think, uh, oh, boy [laughter]. 
1 it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot.
0 anything good or anything like that, but you know, I'm sure that there are a
0 Cosby show, Kisha Knight Pullman, was starting a, I guess now she's
0 turned out to be kind of a joke, the ones I knew, you know, always chose the
1 B:  Oh, yeah [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter].

0 tank fishing and,

0 to bank fishing so,
1 B:  Just see what it does [laughter]. 
0 stuff on the hook itself?
0 you can get the artificial pork or you can use the real slab of pork,
1 B:  I guess, I couldn't imagine that it, anything like that until I started
0 B:  you know, that sounds like okay, but I never would have thought of doing
1 wanted to start something so I remembered something I learned I think when I
0 B:  Well, I know that I learned how to knit one time and, um, made a few
1 things but I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how
0 B:  Well, if I remember I think we made some, like Christmas stockings, you
1 B:  And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff but,
1 A:  I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  And so I do little news reports and things.  It's not as exciting as it
1 [laughter],
1 never get to it.
1 B:  So, unless the kids are asleep I don't get, usually get much done either
0 A:  I show-, I showed mine to my boyfriend and he was like, you didn't make

1 A:  All right, that's a hobby in itself.

0 A:  Sing pop music.
1 A:  So I'm trying to be sensible, sensible, too, at the same time.
1 A:  Yeah, exactly.  My parents would have a fit probably.
0 A:  But, uh, I think, I either have a call or, yeah, I do have a call, hold on
1 B:  It was nice talking to you, too, #good luck with your singing.#
0 change, I don't think, um, that's, uh, been surpassed by anything else than,
0 uh, that because most women seem to be taking into careers and working now and
0 different jobs, different, you know, they're, they're, how do you say they're,
0 see what work they're doing.  You know, you don't get credit for working in

0 A:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
0 B:  They're saying that there's kind of like a glass ceiling that, uh, you just
0 mean, starting with women working a lot in the work force in the last twenty
0 businesses, still don't seem to have gotten away from what we might kind of
1 consider a more woman kind of business.  I call it like the three C -s,
1 A:  Right.
1 clothing store is much preferred,
1 values that, that you're brought up with.
1 A:  A computer is unisex.
0 B:  But historically --
1 A:  which can really satisfy you and not a man around or, I don't, I don't
1 know [laughter].
1 so you don't want to think about a car now designed by a woman, huh?
1 A:  Exactly,
1 B:  [Laughter]  Well, there's possibility that there's some woman on those
1 B:  Bob ((Macky)) and such [laughter].
1 Pierre Cardin and,
1 A:  and, uh, Halston, course he died of AIDS so there, that's proof.
1 A:  Thank you very much for talking, bye.
0 A:  So, uh, what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or
0 something, then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out
0 B:  No, you can't do that very often.
0 spend that money but it's not, it's not what I want to spend it on, you know.
0 A:  And so they, the government doesn't allow me to work.
0 B:  Yeah, so all the money comes from home.
0 your monthly spending?
0 A:  Well, the thing is, is that, um, I ba-, I basically know how much I have,
0 to call, you know, international.

1 know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood but,
0 B:  [Laughter] As you know, I think it's more like the mess you make, isn't it?
0 A:  Do you find you do most of your, your, uh, crocheting or your knit work
0 A:  Yeah.
0 uh, my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters.  So, those
0 easy to do, and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because

0 B:  If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or
0 other, don't worry about it.  We have a, a very small phone company down here.
1 A:  Oh, okay. 
0 early or later.  It seems like all I got was,
0 B:  Supposedly after the soil warms up. 
0 B:  I'm sorry, go ahead.

0 A:  Oh no.  [laughter]
0 more and so on and so on.  So I suspect that it's, it's an ever growing

1 A:  Well I spent three years in Germany, so I'm not too thrilled with the whole

1 B:  You must, well, uh, it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it?

1 B:  Huh-uh.  Yeah, it hasn't been, I know, I was called up right away
1 B:  Right, right.  You're right it wasn't a very pleasant experience.
1 B:  Because, I felt like there was a camera watching. 
1 the, for the nurse who was conducting the test in the health center though.
1 Asked her if she enjoyed her job [laughter].
1 B:  What did she say?  [laughter].
1 A:  She thought it was different, you get to meet a lot of people [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] You know, that was, that was a really interesting because it was
1 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  and, in fact, I know some people that probably will quit before being

0 won't accept anything else.
1 A:  Right. 
1 B:  [Laughter] It's just like well, we know you take it, we've got the positive

0 A:  Okay, well, uh, hum. Well. 
1 A:  Yeah, I'm sure it is. 
1 Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things.  Uh,
1 B:  like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when I get home from aerobics I

0 Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,
0 have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved.

0 front of a T V set for hours.

1 A:  Ye-, I'm not old enough to recall that one [laughter].
1 them all on repeats.  Like STAR TREK, they thought that was much too violent
1 B:  Huh.
0 B:  Yeah.  That's, that's interesting.  Uh, I think it's interesting that
0 B:  -- different dialects.
0 A:  Bye-bye.
0 more stepchild we have to carry around.
0 money, that's not their problem, but there's no food for them to buy, and its,
0 think it's come through.  I've enjoyed talking to you.
0 of, kind of late to, you know, to start, be trying to trade for somebody,
0 years.  I used to go, take my son, you know, when he was in high school, he
0 A:  Yeah, yeah at least,
0 B:  Huh-uh.  
1 Da-, the Rangers and the Astros.
0 B:  Boy, I tell you that would draw a crowd, wouldn't it.
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 ((Incavalia)) I don't know how familiar you are with him but, last year I was
0 Rangers though.  Apparently I think his contract is up after the end of this
1 as some of the other teams do.
0 A:  Well I hadn't either,
0 A:  We hadn't, you know, like I said, we, I don't even guess they've even
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And it started raining and I was hysterical.  I was, I was, I mean, you
0 B:  Yes, I understand.
0 A:  And they laughed at me, they thought that was so hysterical.
1 or the baby.  
1 B:  It's like all right, whose corners is this one.
0 outdoor cats.
0 A:  And they didn't used to be actually, but they got kind of wild and weren't
1 A:  I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony [laughter].
1 B:  Yes, uh-huh, that's it [laughter].
1 B:   tod-, I mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for
0 B:  There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.
0 because I feel like I don't, I can't take care of them as well because they're
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  It was like we can't take it back you've got, we've got to keep it now.
0 on your ears and your fingers.
0 A:  Yeah, he, I asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably
0 weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed, so.
1 our chest and it's like oh, your claws need trimming.
1 B:  Oh yes, yes.
0 B:  Oh it just drives us nuts.
0 cats actually.
0 personality than a dog. 
0 A:  And they just act so funny.
1 pursuit.  It's like this train.
1 B:  I mean it sounds like a train.  We have wooden floors and so it just sort
0 B:  Nothing.
1 B:  And she's so ugly.
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  And, uh, I mean, it comes bedtime and she's right there.
0 B:  Oh, goodness.  You get so attached to them.
0 B:  This is nothing like cats.
1 A:  It wouldn't have, no that would be a problem [laughter].
0 do like cats, right.  We don't li-,
1 ripped up and down at the bottom he said, of course I love cats.
1 pregnant and have cats.  I'm like, uh, no, no, no.
0 B:  Right, the child will learn to like cats.  
0 B:  and deal with them, I'm sorry, we are not getting rid of the cats.
1 A:  Oh I wouldn't either.  There'd be no way. 
1 B:  The whole family was so disappointed [laughter].
1 at night.
0 hadn't blown away but they had flattened.  And I said okay, I didn't, you
0 Hills, it's the greatest place in the world to go camping.  You throw a pack
1 go camping.
1 of course I slipped and fell in.
1 A:  Yeah, yeah, I, I hope to never venture into something that drastic.  
0 for hand outs, you know.  Of course, I'm,
0 A:  Yeah a couple of generations of, you know, being around people and boy
0 everything is just, you know, you know, souvenirs and all this kind of junk.
0 his car most of the time and, and, uh, listened to his tapes.  And fortunately
0 the campgrounds had railroad ties blocking off a sandy pit and that made for a
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 him up the, the hill and,
0 couldn't have been any better.  A good place to dive for balls.
1 with, with as much blood and, and guts as possible.
1 B:  Oh, how awful [laughter].
1 uh, going, I guess.
0 A:  Oh, I loved it.
0 was phenomenal.  
0 in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman, but, uh.
1 live in a suburb of Dayton.  
1 A:  Is, is the Kmart there?  [laughter].
0 image.
0 A:  Unbelievable.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 totally retarded.
1 B:  That's right.
0 B:  Yes.
0 B:  And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.
1 shoot them up things.
1 Hoffman fan anyway.  But he wa-, but before he saw the movie he was like
1 disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this [laughter].
0 with the kinds of problems that he had.
1 B:  Okay, well, go ahead, I'll let you start.
0 earners for their family, or they had somebody at home that was ill that they
0 people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line
1 B:  [Child] {in background} What did you say?  Uh-huh.
0 and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came
1 B:  Yeah, that's true a lot of them are still out there.  
1 A:  Well, it's real pretty, it's like a swamp.
1 B:  Oh okay, real pretty, like a swamp, oh yeah.
1 This is, uh, a T I experiment to see how talk, Texans talk to other people.
0 everybody spend some time in public service.
0 from other countries, I mean other parts of the state, you know, of course
1 A:  Because we don't have much coal.
0 A:  So does your company have something to do with T I.
0 B:  They just, uh, they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business
0 A:  I was led to believe that if you weren't T I that you get money.  I'm not T
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah, well he's gotten a good mix.  I was saying because I've,
0 people in different states and stuff.
1 so probably knock T I profits margin way down.
0 B:  Yeah right, this is probably some government study program.  
0 A:  I live in San Antonio.
0 city but there isn't any, uh, advertising campaign.  There's just not any push
0 those cash for cans.  I don't know if you all have those things around.
0 A:  Yes.
0 everything else like the tra-, uh, paper and plastic and stuff you still have
0 B:  but for aluminum that's real nice and I started doing that at work.  Um,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 really trying, I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we
0 A:  Yeah.
1 took several home because I'm moving pretty soon and they're good boxes.
1 A:  So, you know, there, they don't take up much storage space.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Those and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in, with the
0 some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids,
1 B:  I think I'll have to try that.  That's really cute.
1 B:  You saved me some money.
0 B:  I mean, they're real hard to find the places that pay.  And that's really
0 A:  and it's for recycling and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic
0 real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  And someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Oh, I saw it.
1 B:  Good, we've both seen one [laughter].  Did you cry through it?
1 half an hour long, so.
0 B:  Um, let's see, when I, each time that I thought that the Indians were going
0 A:  I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed [laughter].
0 out from under him.
0 A:  And then he, uh, the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah, it's not,
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing.
0 A:  That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves [barking].
0 A:  Yeah, what, they just don't howl that much anymore.
1 A:  I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off and that's all
1 they'd have to do [laughter].
0 B:  Okay, oh, I'm not sure.
0 B:  Bye, bye.
0 B:  It's one of the things that founded this country.  I can't imagine trying
0 to, to do that and if you passed laws, you're going to make a lot of
0 B:  and, uh, they know that there are tens of thousands of them out in this
0 A:  Golly, well the,
0 B:  -- they're now criminals.
0 A:  You know, and it's, it's crazy.  They're just putting more, giving more
0 B:  No, no, absolutely.  You know, it's like, uh, I, I, I don't really quite
0 registration in the sense that, uh, a, a, a lawful person can go down and get
0 wealth in, in, in the citizen having firearms.  And that hidden wealth is, is
1 tough row to hoe there.
0 B:  Yeah [cough].
0 B:  Pardon my for coughing, I've been coming down with a cold.
0 B:  I, I was tired of blow outs and it --
1 A:  Okay, I wasn't living here then, so, I can't talk much about that
0 willing to pay if unfortunately.  Uh, and you get star players like, uh, like
0 A:  Yeah, I think the owners have somewhat lost sight on that because, uh, they
0 B:  Yeah.
0 come here and own, uh, uh, Tex-, a team in Texas.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  #He's got a mouth on him#.
0 A:  Kind of like, uh, Jerry ((Glanville)).
1 A:  No, I like the team, I really, really like the Eagles a lot, but, uh, Buddy
0 Philadelphia nobody wants to touch him right now.
0 B:  Yeah, but, uh, he'll, he'll wind somewhere.
0 A:  I'm sure he will.  He's not going to have problems there.  If not in the N
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 uh, the N F L out of, uh, W L A F.
1 B:  Sometimes I've wondered if it wasn't almost more than we needed to know.
0 B:  Uh, I'm at work, yes.  
0 in for a trading post type thing and, uh, the, fif-, music from the fifties
0 handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they'll
0 B:  And, and of course they did a good bit for some of the war stuff.  But
1 person says, the person's face and says how do you feel that you house has
1 burned to the ground [laughter].
0 A:  It's a bit much isn't it.
0 B:  Yeah, I, I, yeah, I, I, I truly believe that, that before that, that we
1 A:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 the freeways and we get an occasional, it depends which way the winds blowing
1 this black ash on their cars,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  So, you're right, they could do something a-. about, about that, I guess.
0 A:  They have?
0 may be less than was previously suspected.  Um, that it may be other natural
0 A:  Uh, natural disease,
0 A:  Uh, we can demand, uh, more efficient automobiles for one thing.  I still
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.  I mean, I
1 A:  Now that's an idea. don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city
0 your tail pipe and, uh, the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts and
0 A:  I mean I guess you could take those off too but,
0 A:  [throat_clearing]
1 A:  That's a, that's quite a concept.  You should, uh, pursue that I think, or
0 A:  Uh, but you know a proposal to, uh, uh, I guess the proper authorities,
1 A:  But you have one at work.
0 home.
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  Well, uh, for us it's, uh, uh, you know, it's like for doing like, you
0 manage it a lot easier than, than the old one.
0 screen and check where you wanted to start, and where,
0 B:  What a hassle, yeah, yeah.
0 program and the other one I had the program running.
1 A:  in this case.  After you load it up change it, hope that's right,
0 A:  get out of that, run the program, 
0 it's like in the old computers, the ones that, uh, we're using here a couple
1 B:  Yeah, right, right.  Yeah, I know, I, uh, I remember my college days
1 A:  It was like, this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get
0 um, if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer
1 B:  Oh, that would be great.
0 A:  Yeah, but I mean the price has really gone down.  I mean, I B M which, uh,
0 A:  And, I think they stopped producing the I B M P C.
0 A:  to them.  
1 problem was that when they took that one out, the small computer was the I B M
1 P C [laughter].
0 market something that's smaller when no-, nobody uses anything that's smaller
0 A:  Because of, of their, you know, you can work with it a lot easier.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  But don't, don't you,
1 Italian and,
0 A:  but I, I kind of don't eat Italian foods unless I go home because my mom
1 and my roommate go there every Sunday,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  noodles and pasta and such.
0 B:  Humidity or something.
0 A:  um, that's what I want.  That's what I like to make is just real neat
1 everything, it had all the vegetables in it, but, it seemed kind of boring
0 B:  It kind of, uh, kind of down played compared to what you would like, huh.
0 weeks later and I made, what did I make that night.  I made a roast,
0 A:  And normally I, don't eat, we don't eat like that during the week because
0 of the, you know, the calories and the fat in it.
1 A:  But you know, when we're having guests, we just kind of say, oh just do it.
0 And I made blueberry cobbler [laughter] and we had extra crust with it,
0 A:  So, do you have anything else you want to say about it?
0 A:  Okay, bye.
1 the river.
1 A:  or, you know, where the trail didn't necessarily lead, and where you
1 off and what not but, uh,
0 A:  My parents, uh, were sailing, uh, this last year down off, uh, Costa Rica
0 river there, but they went white water rafting and Mom said it was absolutely
0 scared, that risk of like gosh, what could happen and then the thrill of, you
0 A:  Well that's true.
1 looks like, you know, and okay, now we'll go look for one.
0 and things and, along that line and, uh, I like to see where the company makes
0 that's important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan that's
0 to year, but at least you can change periodically, uh, as, to, you know,
0 medical coverage.  
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah.
0 process of trying to catch up.
0 A:  We were, we were way behind financially and so haven't really, uh, quite
1 guess the, uh,
0 else.
0 #when you get vacation and how much.#
0 A:  they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and
0 A:   or seven, uh, that's kind of far away [laughter].
0 President got from the American people.
0 B:  And this time President Bush did it through action and he,
0 election, anyway.
0 with the people that are over there in the mean time.
1 all of a sudden are, uh, are cheering for Baker on his drive for, to reconcile
0 B:  Well, I don't, yeah, I'd certainly, uh, support Israel in, in their, their
0 foreign policy, I think, I think the stand they have, or, or the way the
0 here.  But, uh, um, so, okay so I can't say whether that, that I'm pro Israel
0 the P L O says well we'll see if we can work with Israel, then, uh, they get
0 B:  I, I'm, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next
1 @A:  Uh, just about any kind of music except acid rock [static], 
0 B:  Yeah, I did, too,
1 Williams and all of those old country and western songs.
1 B:  [/Static] Oh, really.  You're older than I am [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought,
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  my husband says I'm getting old [laughter]. 
1 [laughter] I've got a, I've got a two year old who's now getting, I'm getting
1 well versed in, in kiddy music [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah  [laughter].
1 A:  but, uh,
1 and sit down at the piano and bang out music --
0 B:  Yeah, oh, yeah, I've, I've done, I've done that at church too. 
1 music either.
1 A:  Uh-huh, no.
0 B:  that is not, I don't know what that is, but that's not music [laughter].
0 talking in a beat, it is just,
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  it doesn't give you relaxation, you can't dance to it, you can't do
0 B:  never been.  
0 A:  Yeah, it, it, uh, I can't remember how far in advance we reserved,
0 A:  Just, just ever so often -- 
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  -- you know, a real, a real good one like that one and,
1 not real old, my wife she is old too,
1 A:  Uh, 
1 B:  I think, I think they're a bit over exposed [laughter]. 
1 about,
0 B:  Oh, we, we watch those award shows too, we enjoy watching the country and
0 A:  Yeah.
0 is, uh, probably Eddy Arnold.
0 A:  I got a, I've got about a hundred and, or had a, uh, some, uh, I sold
0 some of them, I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records
0 of country and western,
0 B:  I've, I've never seen a Gene Autry movie,
1 A:  -- Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  at the time.  
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  if you could find them that worked [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  Yeah, yeah.  
0 B:  at all, ne-, neither are tapes.  I, I bu-, we buy cassette tapes,
1 B:  and so, the best bet, any, anymo-, these days are compact disk, those
0 A:  so that's all you had to listen to was the,
1 B:  -- i-, i-, kept and yo-, it just didn't vegetate your mind like television
1 B:  Uh, I think they should do it.  
1 if, if you are on drugs, then that affects the way you work and everything.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 always thought that they were slow as far as outside of the government, you
0 A:  It's no big deal.  
0 had to take, they did it blood and urine, and, uh, they, they gave you a paper
0 B:  -- you know, and they wrote down that they, uh, weren't, but then they went
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 should be.  If they going to check, you know, that way you can't stay, well
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Yeah, yeah.  
1 A:  I don't think you can hide certain drugs [laughter].  
0 A:  That's what he told,
0 B:  And, e-, and even, uh, I don't know, sometimes I think they should even
0 A:  And then they're strung out on drugs secretly.  
0 A:  You know, they go off, because they have a drug problem.  
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 problem and they come out and they say they're having the problem, so then
1 A:  Because we have some alkies, too, boy.  You can smell it on they breath.
0 B:  [Laughter].  
1 nothing you can do because they not drunk.
0 A:  But you know they drink constantly, 
0 A:  So why are, you know, why don't they just, to me they ought to just do the
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  you know.  They still got a drug habit, but they're legal [laughter].
1 A:  it's like, huh-uh, huh-uh, no.  They need, they need some help, too
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 like, to calm him down.
0 A:  You know, but see, now they're gone.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 for everyone?
0 B:  than someone that just goes right straight into college. 
0 A:  The only complication is, is, is how do you fund something like this?
0 colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in, in trying to
0 world, but, uh, it gave them something to do.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- almost at will.  
0 Security number, of course, permits people to do that --
0 organizations, and that is that some of the organizations sell their mailing
1 B:  -- which I think is a, is an invasion of privacy.  
1 A:  I agree [laughter].  
1 A:  Yes, I get some of these things in the mail that I wonder, where in the
1 well, who's going to get ahold of this and think, um, that's a nice place to
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  -- for a variety of things from,
1 A:  I got one tonight about six thirty when I sat down to eat dinner, carpet
0 B:  And so, that, uh, that bothers me because I, of course, I enjoy being at
0 B:  -- uh, particularly solicit-, you know, soliciting.  So, g-, having your,
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  -- here at home under each of those names.  
1 right when, when you've just gotten home from work.  The last thing you want
1 B:  I think, I think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner,
0 shut off the phone --
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  -- so she'll, you know, why are you cutting off the phone,
0 it even that much worse.  And, uh, it just, I get to where I, I turn the
1 answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone, but now with this
0 B:  Well I have, now we have a, you know, voice mail system at, uh, at the
0 office.
1 B:  -- a ring at all.  
0 B:  And when I, when I want to be, you know, not bothered during the day,
0 ((Tigon)), uh, part of G T E or vice versa or something like that.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Yes.  
1 A:  Huh [laughter].  
1 B:  As soon as we determine what we're going to do with Contel after we bought
1 A:  I didn't think we could go too far on this privacy thing, but, uh,
1 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  Sure, good talking to you, Jim.  
0 A:  Uh, no, I haven't seen that one yet, either.  
0 A:  Steve Martin did a pretty good job.  
1 A:  -- and nothing's as crazy as what they, how they, uh, uh, describe it in
0 B:  I've lived in Washington, but not California so,  
0 reality.
0 A:  No, I haven't seen that one yet either.  
1 ought to go see it over and over again, and, uh, I thought it was just kind of
0 have.
0 SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?  Have you,
0 A:  Yeah, I've heard that's really, really good.  
0 A:  Uh, friend of mine at work, 
0 B:  It's pretty intriguing.
1 A:  Well, I understand it has a real complicated plot.  
1 B:  I was trying to think if I've seen any others lately, but that probably
0 pretty much sums up, I don't get to go to the movie too much [laughter].
0 A:  Well, that's interesting.  
0 A:  The special effects were great.  I have to admit that.  
0 A:  It's,
1 A:  who, uh, creates a person, uh, out of, uh, oh, just, uh, spare parts and
0 B:  Oh, huh.  
0 life is like, uh, in a, uh, moderately normal suburb.
0 A:  it's, uh, 
0 A:  Oh, yes certainly, uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh, he, uh, carves out different figures in the, in the plants,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 though he cannot afford, uh, the, the price.
0 B:  [Static].
0 A:  Oh, they, well they have more of the artsy type of, uh, 
0 A:  films.  A lot of foreign films there.  
0 A:  No, not too,
1 just,
1 A:  Oh, okay.  
0 B:  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  
0 A:  -- or THE ACCUSED. 
0 A:  I never did care for her too much in the other films, 
0 so real that she sounds like she's from that area of the country.
0 I, I'm sure I've seen him in other movies, but he looked so, his, his face,
0 A:  almost identical.  
0 A:  Right.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Well [laughter],
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh, [smacks] I, am quite positive on the things that I have seen
0 homemaking duties and also how women will, uh, have their children and then
0 uh, the Vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men.
0 being brought up, you know, in a, uh, kind of a, uh, community,
0 that.  What, in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the
0 uh, an increasing equality, uh, greater presence of women in management 
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  That's strange.  
0 half my age, so that by definition that means,
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
0 A:  I know the day care centers are not cheap either.  You know they're, 
0 B:  I haven't ever really looked at them.  Are you aware at all,
1 American society?
0 B:  (( )).
0 time.
0 B:  Uh, because the pressures on them are, are, 
0 B:  rather, rather formidable.  
1 B:  So,
1 B:  Yeah,
1 A:  [Laughter] No kids,
0 B:  -- doing s-, 
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  hours a week or five percent of their salary,
1 A:  we could, they could solve all the world's problems or something.
1 we could, uh,
0 A:  Substitute.  My, my,
1 problem.#  
0 B:  #Yeah, it# sounds pretty good [laughter].  That sounds good.  I've noticed
0 volunteer at a nursing home and stuff [sniffing] like that [throat_clearing].
1 B:  [Sniffing].
1 A:  Long way, uh,
1 A:  You know.  We just got our phone back today, uh,
0 B:  [Throat_clearing].
0 A:  And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth or,
1 because we don't want recognition for it, you know --
0 B:  #Yeah.#
1 A:  You know. Twenty-five, I don't know.  Twenty-five percent?  {speaker A asks
1 [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, [laughter] well,
1 B:  I don't think that, some people I don't think have, uh, a year in them to
0 volunteer if you know what I mean.  They're not worth it [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, yeah, that's true, that's true.
1 know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala.
1 B:  [Laughter] I couldn't either.
0 B:  Right, #right.#
1 mean, I'm grateful for people like that, but,
0 A:  Yeah, I don't,
0 A:  #Yeah,# yeah, well neither can I, so, I, I, I, I, I, I,
0 A:  did my service before and I'll do my little community service throughout,
1 A:  -- #never for a year again.#
1 B:  [Laughter] I know the feeling.
1 A:  So, so I guess our vote is no [laughter].
0 A:  You know.
0 A:  #So they're going to have it,# to me they ought to do it.  
0 waiting on death row.
0 B:  That, uh, is not necessary.  
0 B:  Yeah.  Have you ever been on a jury?  
0 A:  What do you mean, what if they're,
1 punishment, but if I were sitting on a jury and had to make the decision
1 people in prison.  The jails are overcrowded.  If they're going to do, well,
0 you know, let's do it [laughter] --
0 A:  I don't know if I could, I could prob-, it depends on the crime.  My
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Y-, yeah, I don't think they give it to just,
1 A:  I think they just put them in jail and let them think about it [laughter].
0 A:  Because it all depends,
0 another state I think it was Ohio, where they don't have, uh, self-defense
1 B:  Is it?  I, I'm from, I've lived in Ohio and I didn't realize that
0 A:  in the stomach and then tried to cut her throat -- 
0 A:  they sent her to jail, so that's not right.  
1 A:  They, she's, nothing should have happened to her at all.  He shouldn't have
0 hit her in the stomach.  I don't care [laughter].
1 B:  Well, see he shouldn't have been trying to slit her throat anyway
0 A:  But, he did both.  
0 A:  he would beat his wife all the time.  
0 B:  So there was a history of that?
0 A:  He hit her in the stomach with the shovel.  
0 to him, but I think she should stay in there because really she just did it
1 A:  See, I think that's wrong, too.  #But, I don't,# 
0 had a boyfriend.  It was #weird.#
0 killing a cop or, you know, assassination of the President and, and something
1 should keep them waiting in jail and let, having us pay for it for twenty
0 executes more people than just about any other state.
0 A:  But, I think they going to have to do something to make people wake up,
1 mean I know they ought to get in trouble, I'm not,
0 if the government really want to, I think it's all government, something to do
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  -- you know.  If you think, you think about all the kids in the ghetto.  My
0 A:  They use the, the injection thing.  
0 A:  It's funny because I had listened to a comedian talk about the death
1 A:  I guess if you stay out of trouble, you don't have you worry about it, but
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 A:  All righty.  
0 A:  Okay.  
0 give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home and --
1 A:  there's even less interest there.  They're more for, I g-,
1 A:  Not, not, yeah.  
1 B:  Grab, grab, grab, walk out [laughter].  
1 A:  I think it's a really a good thing.  I, I like to see, of course, there's,
0 B:  But, since there is much that needs to be done here.  
1 but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess.
0 B:  Uh-huh, I have two girls and one boy.
1 A:  Uh, yeah, I got two grandchildren.
1 B:  Oh, I got ahead of you there.  I got three and one on the way [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, uh,
0 B:  #I think that's kind of the key,# don't you?
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  it's not a matter of choice anymore, I think most people,
0 B:  at the time, I worked third shift to be with my kids during the day,
0 B:  so, they were always with a family member, you know.   
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  The mother's aren't there.
0 A:  Yep.   
1 A:  Yeah.   
0 A:  and then rented a, a duplex. 
0 B:  I do, I do.   
0 B:  Yes, I do.  I do. 
0 A:  or your husband?   
1 A:  Yeah.   
1 A:  ((Oh)).  Well, we're supposed to get rain but no, [laughter], snow.
1 A:  in the daytime.  
1 B:  [Laughter] I'm jealous.   
0 B:  So, it's kind of tough,  
0 it will, it will get warm one day and then not real cold but,
0 B:  Oh, wow.   
1 B:  Yeah.  Well, uh, I, I can tell by your accent that you're a Texan, and, you
1 know, I miss hearing that, [laughter].
1 so funny.
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 flat, and, uh, I asked them, I said, do you have a tire tool in the, in the
1 trunk?
1 A:  And he said, a what?  And I said, a tire tool.   
1 B:  [Laughter].   
1 A:  [Laughter] He said, you mean a t a r {spells out word} tool and I said,
1 no, a t i r e {spells out word} tool [laughter].
1 @@B:  Yeah, right.  [laughter].  Like oil, [laughter] or oil [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].   
1 the big ten, a prestigious conference, I joined the marching band.
0 A:  So, with the band,
1 and went to Notre Dame, where he decided he was going to have a good time
1 [laughter],
1 bands, he went into, uh, bands on campus.  And he played music but I, I just
1 A:  He went the other route.  I think, uh, I think, the advise I'd give to
1 B:  At least start saving.   
0 where at least they'll have a chance to get ahead.
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 really good at that in high school, and, uh, by the time I was a sophomore, I
1 B:  Uh-huh.    
0 B:  Um, I really don't think it makes that much difference what size of the
1 areas, uh, it could be difficult to, uh, make a career out of it.
1 B:  Kind of like, uh, going to S M U.  They have a reputation as being a party
1 academics.
1 A:  Hey, I'm headed there [laughter].   
1 B:  Yeah.   
1 A:  [Laughter].   
0 B:  I was just mak-, making [laughter], a point that some schools develop
1 certain reputations and,
1 A:  No, I, I agree, [laughter] but, but it's like, oh, you offer this degree,
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 B:  It's very difficult to maintain a full-time job and try to take, uh,
1 A:  And, and just lived the easy life.   
1 because when you're a poor, staving student, you don't have the, uh, cash flow
1 A:  I, I, uh, I picked up sweats for the track team.  I was the track, track
1 team manager.  We got, I got to ride the bus all over the state [laughter].
0 reputation they have in the country.  And, uh, go from there.  The rest of
1 A:  Yeah.   
1 B:  Whether you like the mascot or not, or whether [laughter] it's close by.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, that's true.   
0 B:  I mean, uh, Wisconsin was only, ((up, uh)), sixty mile bus ride away from
0 my parents house.  So, it only took an hour to get back on, uh, oh, a couple
0 A:  Well, we're still writing checks for the loans, 
1 B:  Tried to have fun.   
1 A:  Uh, I really, I miss college.  I had a good time.   
1 B:  Well, wonder if, if this advice was, uh, worth following for, uh, choosing
0 A:  [Laughter] Hopefully.  I, I gue-, I don't know what they're doing with the
0 A:  Okay.   
0 A:   Do you,
0 B:  as expensive as they are to produce, they certainly don't want any dead
0 B:  Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that
0 B:  that was, in my estimate, nowhere near truth but was much better for
0 way as the, you know, news articles or whatever they had, they had already
0 I, I did grow up with David Brinkley.  Uh,
0 restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day, one in the morning and one
1 A:  Really?   
1 B:  and I don't need their fill-ins, you know [laughter].   
0 your prior experience with the military did,
0 page of that, little brief paragraphs, unless that was one of their, the focus
0 A:  Right.   
0 A:  Right.   
0 got, you know, an introductory subscription, so, we decided to try it because
0 we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us, so to
0 another example, they just, they just show you the words and the facts and
0 B:  and they can't get around but then they have full care.  But I really
0 but it's, it's really nice to see them because, I mean sometimes, like I had a
0 brothers and sisters, and I know it was hard for me as well as it was for them
0 to, to actually sit down, because she doesn't like doing things that the
0 look into that for a person, is, is, is like you're saying, a good mix of
1 it's a big, you know, Dallas area is a big metropolitan area.
0 everything.
0 we get older, and the, the money that it now requires to, uh, be in one of
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, and like you said, they're trying to make it, the caretakers in some
0 B:  Oh, yeah, so you've,
0 A:  It, it, it just sometimes, it just seems ridiculous.  
0 B:  Well, like there are other communities, too, that aren't necessarily a
0 bedroom house, but it was a separate house, and they had a living room, and a
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  And that, and they always cooked, then they had, they had the choice, you
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  So, it's, it's more like living with a big, in a big house where it's your
0 A:  Definitely.  Well, he was a good player.  I guess, well I don't know, he
0 A:  Emmett Smith, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, I kind of, I haven't been keeping up with football, I mean, in the
1 fall I, I can go on and on about football, but since it's kind of off season,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 of the guy's name, either, the coach of the Vikings.
1 A:  Except I think the Cowboys are on the upswing [throat_clearing].  I don't
1 season, he never really got in a game, never did a whole lot.
0 every time.  So, sounds like he's going to be all right for next season.
1 They're just trying not to overwork him right now, until he gets his
1 they're trying to keep him, you know, keep him, uh, from reinjuring anything,
1 B:  So, anyway, I guess we can't talk much more about that, but I just thought
1 I'd throw that in there [laughter].
0 think tickets are,
0 they're all going up, (( )) more or less is what it's going to do.
1 think about that.  I just remember trying to figure out where you could get
0 B:  You sure did.  Yeah.

0 A:  It's, it's clothing.
1 that I take off under tables when I'm in a conference room,
0 B:  because I can't stand having anything on my feet.  And, uh, say I like
0 I'm working,
0 in the winter time up there?
0 because some dress pants, you know, cost me twenty-five dollars, which is the
0 same as jeans.
0 when we came to work, I was told that the president of the company set the
1 standard of dress, and he's, he dressed like the janitor,
0 came about.  Because when I came back I saw ties and jackets in T I for the
0 above the equator.
1 was there three years, or four years, rather, and never missed them.
1 what time it was.
0 B:  And, uh, yeah, we were about the first ones to make those, and went out of

0 charity.
0 A:  I think as we all get in the swing of things this is just a beginning,
0 A:  We have places that we can take our motor oil to if you change your own
0 B:  Now, that's, we, we don't have that, that's neat.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- um, machine oil, because I always have my oil changed out of the house,
0 B:  No.
0 A:  Um, the Styrofoam.  
0 B:  That's the one that never did.  
0 A:  Yeah, never did some,
1 B:  But that's, that's hard if you don't have a big yard or if you live in an
1 apartment [laughter].
0 A:  Right, that's for sure.
0 A:  [Throat_clearing].
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Well I guess the only people I've talked to before were from

1 THIRTY SOMETHING and TWIN PEAKS, uh, and I just discovered that they, uh, have
1 B:  Oh really, yeah.
0 A:  Well, let me tell you that, TWIN PEAKS was much better when it just
0 it, it's not worth watching, y-,

1 somebody says, what's the deer head doing here.  And they said oh, it fell off
1 the wall.  [laughter] So why was it doing on the wall?

0 would be, uh --
0 B:  How do you feel about it?  Do you, do you think there should be capital
1 somehow.
1 B:  I think all our laws are really screwed up.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  -- if you get them where they have a sense of values and, uh --
0 A:  -- you know, that, uh,
0 B:  -- or as children.
0 A:  Can't remember that.
0 A:  We had a personal experience with something like that.  It wasn't, didn't
0 are mentally incompetent, you know, uh, like deranged.  It's so hard to get
1 the same time.  So that's my husband's deal.  He's out there, you know
0 even hickory chips on the barbecue, you know, get a little different flavor,
0 A:  -- and put a little red wine in it --
1 B:  Oh, okay.  My only other standard menu, I guess, is, uh, Thanksgiving
0 B:  -- inside the turkey.  And then, of course we always had to have mashed
0 A:  Oh yeah.
1 B:  And your standard vegetables, like you always had to have some peas and
0 corn [laughter].
1 A:  So being from the north, I guess corn bread and black-eye peas are, are
1 green onions.
0 A:  I don't care much for those subs.  There's too much bread for me.  I don't
0 like that much bread.
0 B:  Yeah, that's, it's a different kind of bread, and it's somewhat of a harder
0 crust.
1 A:  I'll eat the dark meat, but you can have the white meat.
1 A:  That's like eating sandpaper.
1 A:  I'll eat it as long as I'm not around while it's being cooked.
0 like that we did have both.  I think we did have both on Thanksgiving, just in
0 good.  For one thing you can carve it and eat it with your hands.  You don't
1 A:  I work at the Lewisville site.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Any decent food in your cafeteria up there?
1 that since, you know, the executives are there that we would have a pretty
1 A:  I think so too.
1 they, they had, they had three kinds of potatoes.
1 B:  Like he would get tuna salad.  This is, what is that, and the first
1 ingredient, no matter what you're making, garlic [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  And he said tuna salad shouldn't taste garlicky [laughter]. But everything
0 makes it, uh, goes crazy with the sage.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And they make them different flavors, like, oh, they have a chocolate chip
1 A:  And they're pretty good sized, too.  But I usually wind up getting a donut
1 [laughter].
0 A:  A chocolate donut.
1 A:  Like I really need the cholesterol.
1 B:  Well.
1 A:  I don't like them cleaning up the dishes [laughter].
1 like the kitchen is a disaster area,
0 B:  Oh, yeah, we haven't found a who-, you know, the best Mexican food we've
0 A:  No.

0 Alabama and Georgia, and this is my first time in one in North Carolina, and
1 pretty bad until I had gone to those ones in Charlotte.

1 called You Are Cook,
0 B:  -- and they're just huge, you know, the meat is just massive --
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  it's just an ongoing,
0 A:  he, he surely doesn't have to worry about supply.
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, you got all these tips.

0 B:  Yeah but the --
1 A:  Yeah, I know.  
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  #No, we do not.#
1 A:  We need more of the tax money to actually get down to the students, because
0 A:  But if we could do something like that I'm sure it would certainly help.
1 B:  Um, that's interesting, and how many administrators is that going to take?
0 home, and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road.
0 it, the question of, of, you know, of how far should you take a kid in the
0 the teachers to motivate these kids.  I had a, a friend that was administrator
1 and we got carried away, and they cut, it beeps in at ten minutes.  So.
1 anything.  Oh another things that's wrong with schools, this is big,
1 think they have to do that because most everybody passes.
1 A:  [Laughter]  But see, they're not in Dallas.
0 A:  -- we don't get that. Okay.
1 and a man just walks up and puts his hand on my doorknob, it's kind of 
0 but it seems kind of bizarre to me to get used to some stranger just coming 
0 B:  I find I throw out a,
0 A:  -- for other Visas, and it's like, wait a minute, we have a commitment with
0 B:  I'll call you.
1 A:  -- I'll call you.
0 rate.  They're always more expensive.  And they, uh, you know, if you stay, if
0 housewife so I'm home a lot in the day --
0 B:  Yeah.
1 women, lay captive with gossip and stuff,
0 witness to them --
0 A:  -- I don't try and convert them.  I just say, You can, you can ei-, you can
0 good-bye and I shut the door, and that's it.  And I'm not angry to them, you
0 B:  mostly telephone sales people that I just, you know, that want to start
1 B:  And then I'm thinking, well how did they know I was married?
0 #And I'm like well# --
1 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 buy a soft, water softener --
0 A:  That's funny.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 people that are giving groceries it's like they, there's just a pattern that
0 A:  #Yeah, I didn't think of that, but yeah, that's good.#
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 that, but I know I need it.  But, um, the only thing I would follow is my
1 B:  He said what?
0 A:  Public bathroom [laughter].
0 B:  Well, you know, the, the terrible thing is, I don't know if you've watched
0 and a big thing in the courts right now is, um, they don't have enough stalls
1 you have to stand in line for an hour.  And, uh, and then the whole,
1 A:  You have to,
0 A:  And I lived with Dana in school.
0 A:  Uh-huh, last weekend.  We went to Six Flags Saturday.
0 A:  I mean, I'm all for donating my time to worthy causes, like I do some
0 volunteer work here and there, and every once in a while I'll do, uh, a, uh,
1 something.
1 B:  Yeah, Africa.
1 B:  Yeah, well.  I doubt that, but,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, maybe a little bit in that perspective, but, uh, and a lot of people
0 B:  Didn't mean to cut you off there.
0 that's, that's com-, committed a chunk of their life to do service work.
1 A:  Everybody I know has been, well, I'm going to go get a goo-, good job and
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah.  Did Dana sign you up for this?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 I talked to somebody about credit card usage.
0 she and her family just didn't have much, and they didn't have much credit
0 you, #you can do certain things with them.#
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, well that's always a good plan.  I can't think of anything else that
0 A:  -- I can't even grow an ivy.  My grandfather gave me a plant once, that
1 B:  Yeah, I don't have too much of a green thumb either.  So.
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, as, as long as you give it, uh, good drainage and, uh, lot of,
1 A:  Plano, oh, yeah.  I'm out in Rowlett, and we have that brown clay soil
1 B:  -- because it's right by their entryway.  And they, they wanted roses.  So
0 B:  I've got quite a few dead shrubs, some wax (( )) and Oleander.
0 A:  But we dug a hole about six times as big as it needs to be and filled it
0 A:  Yeah, it's hard to find something that'll take the heat as well as the
0 trees out front.  I've enjoyed doing those.  I put, uh, pansies out in the
0 B:  Do you do your own, uh, lawn maintenance, or do you hire somebody to, uh,
0 stuff.
0 forty-five by ninety feet.
0 B:  It's what they call low maintenance yard.  And these, uh, uh, maintenance,
0 year.
0 our front yard is so dense --
1 A:  Yeah, ours is not that big, but like I said, if I had to mow the front, I'd
0 be stuck, because I can't get it to move [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  -- doesn't look too good.  So I can't say anything about anybody else's
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  And, uh, those include Arizona Ash and, in some cases, silver maples.
0 B:  Yeah, that's probably true.  I've got a live oak in front.  Uh, I, I really
0 like the oaks a lot.
0 and start them, but --
0 was that I bought it in spring and it was a balled and burlapped tree, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I thi-, I think it's still a year or less for, uh, for shrubs.
0 B:  I'm just waiting for a sale.  
1 B:  {Pause} So, but once they, uh, drop the prices a little bit I'll be out
0 save them.  But this year they look even worse.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  #I've never seen that before.#
1 usually watch T V on Monday nights.
0 CHEERS on Thursdays.
1 B:  Uh-huh.  But those are probably about the only two that I, that I usually
0 B:  My daughter watches that -- 
1 B:  -- and she has to go to bed at eight thirty.
1 B:  And I was thinking, well, do I really want her to go back with such a jerk?
1 A:  I know [laughter].
1 and go, yeah, what a guy.
0 A:  I started watching it, and to this day I still watch it.  I just kind of
1 B:  #I know.#  Excuse me, just a minute, I think, Katy, get off the phone.
1 B:  Ten. 
1 B:  and I've, I've been in the middle of tests and stuff so I keep you
1 saying, oh press three [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].
1 A:  Don't ever start.
1 B:  No [laughter].
1 A:  I just couldn't watch that much T V.
1 I've ever seen in my life.
1 A:  -- is to have to watch them for that long.  I'd kind of be like, uh, this
1 is enough [laughter].
1 B:  So I never had a chance.  But GENERAL HOSPITAL, huh, is one to get hooked
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, I think so, I mean, I guess.  That's the only one I've ever
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  No.
0 A:  because it's like I don't want to get hooked into one of these things
0 B:  And I've never watched that.  I going to have to watch that sometime.
1 B:  And then it goes through ten.
1 up so early to go to classes, I can't stay up past ten thirty, I'm falling
1 guys from downstairs, who, by the way, two of them were from San Antonio
1 [laughter].
1 we just had, it was just a fun, you know,
0 B:  Uh-huh [laughter].
0 really look quite like his video.
1 A:  [Laughter] And he'll say, well, she underestimated her weight by quite a
1 bit [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh [laughter].
1 A:  And of course that was, that's been probably oh, five, six, seven years
1 A:  #We used to do that, but, uh,# I don't know if it even still comes on.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And they had C N N.
0 A:  And, and they, at least I kind of knew what was going on on the other side
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  No, I've heard about it, I've seen a little bit of it.  It was kind of,
0 think we are horrible.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, golly.
0 B:  if I'm going to spend my time.  But it was, um, a lot of, um, borderline
0 Augustine grass in the front yard, I think I would have plowed everything
1 under and had a rice field.
0 A:  Really that bad, huh.  Is it, is it typically this rain-, I don't think
1 B:  Well, maybe I, maybe I can get the yard mowed before it hits.
0 or April, and, um, this was sort of unexpected.  It had actually been pretty
0 point we woke up to the sound of the, uh, the electric lines being ripped off
0 the problem, because my, we keep my wife's car in the garage.  So her car
0 it got, you know, after the initial storm, it got worse as things started to
0 A:  Strangely enough, the roads weren't that, the, the roads themselves were
0 really cold weather, and of those, by the time it gets lunch time, as, as long
1 A:  How, well, when you say cold, what do you mean by cold?  [breathing]
0 B:  Uh, I think of any, thirty-five and below as cold.
0 A:  Oh, sheesh, yeah, um, um, it's right about now when they're talking about
0 degree day I can handle, but the, the, the sad part about here is that winter
0 ends in March or April.  So there isn't that much summer and spring and fall
1 B:  That's the only thing to slow down the wind.
1 than twenty-five warm days a year.
1 B:  I forgot all about that that it had to be pressed.
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 you know, cooking and, uh, preparing meals and stuff.  So, uh, but as far as
1 A:  And like I sa-, I don't have any children.  I'm just engaged, and I'm
1 A:  They like that.  
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Well do you, do you, so you go, if you're, if you're not doing any kind of
0 B:  Yeah, well, that, that would be fun.  Boy, so you, you have a lot of
0 experience as far as, you know, different ways a family can interact and, and
1 you go do the board games and stuff, you still did what you do now.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 little games.  And like hide and seek, well, we have a, a bigger house than a
0 B:  So you, you had a lot of games and things you played --
0 A:  No, no, not at all.
1 B:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  I don't meet, I mean, I don't speak with many people that come from
0 that's his mother --
1 B:  -- you know, and, and their Catholic and, I mean that's,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But, I mean, do you see yourself having thirteen kids --
1 A:  You know.
0 B:  [Laughter]  But it's so expensive, man.
0 B:  Well sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence
0 in like tenth grade.
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Are you going to blow all that money, how easy it is to blow money you
0 my mom said, well that's stupid for you to be blowing money.  She goes, okay
0 B:  Wow,
0 because of the way the laws are, you know, now, if we want to drive, we have
1 @B:  Uh, well, to tell you the truth, my husband does most of the work.
0 A:  What kind of a system does he have?  Does he have a power mower or a riding
1 A:  So you let him enjoy it.
1 B:  Yeah, that's fine [laughter].
1 that [laughter].
0 B:  Last year, this is, I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but last year for the
1 contraption on a pulley handle, and it pulls the lawn mower for you.  Um, it
1 a lot less time to do it.  But I enjoy doing it.  I feel good doing it, uh, I,
0 you know, that goes between the grass and the sidewalk.  Um.
0 A:  Is that a power mower or is that, a power edger or is it?
1 B:  Um.  I think that's all of the power tools we have.  We, um, but that's
1 that's, I think that's about all they make [laughter].
0 A:  But they don't, they, they have special munching, mulching, uh, mowers --
0 B:  It takes, takes him a lot less time because even though he does have to do
0 clippings, you know, rather than taking, I don't know, as an example an hour
1 A:  I've been having it treated.  And it makes it grow much faster.  Uh,
1 so, and then it starts getting cold again in Septem-,
1 remember.
0 it's recommended three, three and a half inches they want me to leave it.  So
1 B:  What kind of grass do you have?
0 like a week and a half, two weeks, then it starts seeding on me.
0 grass either.  I leave it on the lawn,
1 B:  A compost pile.
1 A:  I haven't been very successful.  I'm on my third year now, and I still have
1 B:  It's not composting.
0 A:  No.
1 B:  No, I think it's supposed to be natural.
0 A:  It's not working [laughter].
0 A:  What, air it out?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 than, than a few hours.
0 B:  Uh (( )).
1 B:  Now, I've seen, you know, some different clips of it, um, and it, it looks
0 A:  And they have a particular child actor, uh, who's, who's being supposedly
1 cookies.
1 B:  Uh-huh, oh [laughter],
1 him with oreo cookies [laughter].
1 B:  Hey, that'd work for me, let me tell you [laughter].
1 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  That was rather, um, gross [laughter].
0 A:  I don't, I don't like Stephen King.
0 B:  It's not necessarily, it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful.  I
0 something, you know.
0 A:  Ugh.
0 B:  And that I couldn't watch, and, but, you know, you could tell when it was
1 B:  So yeah, um, that was so that he couldn't leave her, cause she,
0 B:  Yeah, well, as far as that goes, yeah, I mean, you wouldn't like to see
0 her emotions --
1 MY DAUGHTER, but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape, and then we
0 A:  Oh, yeah --
0 B:  Now see I.
1 A:  I'm, I'm intrigued by it, but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet
0 [laughter].
0 B:  Really.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Uh-huh, um.  {pause} Well, I guess that's about it.  #It was nice.#
0 A:  Alright.
0 little strange, you know, this woman supposedly is, um, being mentally abused
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  [Laughter] You know, why didn't she just tell hi-, Hey look bucko, you
0 A:  Oh [sigh].
0 of sad to me.  It really was, and it would, it would be to anyone because, you
1 B:  Well how about KINDERGARTEN COP?
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 player more so than he is, because he really played the part good.
0 B:  I even like some, I mean, some of the original stuff, like I like THE
0 TERMINATOR.  At first, you know, it was kind of strange,
0 A:  I enjoy a lot of movies.  Now as far as, let's say, heavy violence, I can't
1 B:  I don't go for that at all.
1 A:  watchi-, yeah.
1 A:  Watching, yes, [talking] {as if a scared child} oh, I don't want to go
1 as well just plan on staying up all night, because you know [laughter],
1 A:  So they're, you know, (( )) it's just a movie, you know, I try to say, it's
0 WEB. Okay.
0 A:  Oh, uh-huh.
1 was going to die at the end.
1 A:  Die, oh [laughter].  Oh [sigh].
1 B:  Oh, yeah {imitating a crying child}.  She's so nice, she can't die
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Oh [laughter].
1 A:  Oh, I guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars,
1 people like us, you know [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter]  Oh,
1 A:  Oh, uh-huh, oh.
1 A:  Yes.
0 A:  and, if I, you know, if I know the topic I'll go ahead and accept it as
1 mine, but the other day I got one about fishing and I thought, oh, my.
1 A:  I don't know a thing about fishing, so I'm not even going to try
1 [laughter].
0 A:  Because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good
1 B:  Say, well, I know it takes a fishing pole and some bait, and some water
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  and we get, you know, a lot of, a lot of the weather is driven by the
0 got sinuses, if you're bothered with ragweed and mountain cedar and all that
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  {Very faint} Yeah. 
0 real cold,
0 B:  and by noontime you're taking everything off, you know,  
0 uh, you know, by evening you can drop back twenty, thirty degrees,
0 you're all sweated up and warm,
1 B:  Yeah, my, the older I get, the less I like the cold up here I'll tell you
1 [laughter],
0 A:  That snow is pretty to look at, but I, I don't like to drive in it or,
0 A:  It was beautiful weather and it ((is)), 
0 A:  you could go out in short sleeved shirt, and it wasn't that
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Because of, um,  
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 A:  Yeah, and I also spent, uh, eight years with T I out in, uh, Ridgecrest,
0 B:  it was like a hundred and twenty-five or something, and it,
0 and it's so brown,
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  Especially if you can get, find some shade.   
0 A:  ((Having no)),
1 B:  and it, it will change up and give you something that you may like worse
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 ice age.  And I think you all were about a mile and a half deep in ice
0 around, you know,
0 you just can't paint a picture of or,
0 like that, [throat_clearing], week or two when the colors are the brightest,
1 A:  I sure hope we, I sure hope we don't get a hard freeze, 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  we got another week of winter he-, just about, right?   
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 murder and kidnapping.
0 should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the
0 A:  Uh, and we were sequestered but the makeup of the jury, uh, was truly a
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 like ((God)),
1 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.   
0 B:  this is ridiculous [laughter].
0 uh, you know, some of it just seemed rather extreme.
1 you start thinking about well, they've got video tape and, and audio tapes and
0 A:  Isn't that terrible?  And, uh, you know,  
0 A:  for months and months and months and it was a, a genre that I wasn't in
0 it, because if this is, you know, the best of the genre and I should know
1 A:  -- and I usually come away thinking, no I really don't like this show
0 things, I mean --
1 more, I mean, you know, basically stepping on things and yelling in pain --
0 A:  -- and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used.
0 A:  Well, I guess it was a, uh, a very successful movie financially, so --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  The French movies that (( )).
0 very famous, uh, popular movie.  Norman Gray, Norman Gear.
1 name.
0 up his hat, or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind, or something, but
1 A:  -- just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them.
0 worried --
0 A:  Yeah, isn't it amazing.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 know --
1 MUTANT NINJA TURTLES could have been a classic of world theater --
0 A:  -- (( )), it could have been, you know, it was, it was innovative, uh, a
1 that,
0 Campbell type myth, he, the Master should have died at the end --
0 would have make it, uh, broadened the audience that it could have been
0 on their, you know, that, that you wouldn't want to change something, and
0 A:  -- and that's what they're for, but I don't, don't remember them, and I
1 B:  No, it could be.
1 A:  -- or something, because I'm not that old [laughter],
1 @@B:  Um.  Okay, well, I guess I got to get going,
1 A:  Okay, well, um, thanks for hearing me rap, I guess [laughter].
0 A:  Okay, well, I'm from the (( )).
0 B:  Bye-bye.
0 women than ever were in men.  And I think that, you know, women have had
0 have children, they would rather stay home with them --
0 A:  Uh, whereas now, it's a kind of fifty fifty split or leaning whatever
0 testosterone and estrogen across the lower part of the brain, the base of the
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- what it would have to do with the connectivity to the rest of the body.
0 A:  -- just the same as men --
0 handled something over the way another guy would handle it.
0 And, uh, when, when you're raised that way, you kind of perpetuate that, oh,
0 thing affects men.  I think, I just don't think it's any kind of study they
1 A:  Yeah.  The subject would die before they had to run all the tests that they
1 B:  That's right [laughter].  
1 A:  It would be an exhausted test [laughter]. 
0 want a couple to be together, shouldn't they have, uh, defined roles, as it
0 believe that very much.  But, uh, I think that people, when they get into
0 A:  Yeah.  I know one that's still that way, but that's about it.  I'm down to
1 A:  -- I have the kids clamoring for my attention now, 
0 most of our, uh, injuries occur.
0 A:  -- cut and dried, you know.
1 A:  And he tested positive on cocaine.  Now then you always wonder, well is he
1 just saying that [laughter].
0 of the places now, um, like I B M don't allow them smoking, you know --
0 B:  But, um, I work in sort of a building that's, that's not really, well it's
1 time because I kept waiting for my name to came, come up, you know,
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  they never, they never called me, they never, you know, and finally, the
1 A:  You're kidding [laughter].
1 B:  No [laughter].  And so, and, and my boss has, has gone for about like three
1 times, I think.  And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group [laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be #awful if you were [laughter]# --
0 A:  I can't believe I was so {pause} brazen before.  I, like I say, I'm a
0 B:  Oh, what kind of drugs did you use, #if you don't mind?#
1 A:  Um, yes, uh-huh [laughter].
0 B:  Well, it's really lucky that you got away from that.
0 B:  #Cause that's really,#
0 B:  downward spiral.
0 brother who gets high all the time, and I have just casually asked her what he
1 A:  And I just, you know, went, Oh, where?  [Laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh, I see.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.  
0 all the old, original hardwood trim and stuff, so we've got the trim in kind
1 of, uh, kind of an off-white.  And this is really the first, uh, interior
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  -- and we put a flat over the top, and everywhere you'd miss there'd be
0 B:  [Laughter] Every time the sun would come up in the morning I'd see another
1 we've got all hardwood floors, and, uh, we, we've learned to be a little more
1 B:  Okay, yeah.
1 A:  And, they just, they ruin, [laughter],
0 didn't have to mess with that this time.  But I've, I, I grew up on a farm, so
1 or a grainery, or something like that as you would be with your own house.
1 A:  Oh, we got to do that this summer.  We're dreading it.
0 A:  Everything else is white.
0 towards now.
1 need to make sure that that store's not likely to go out of business.
1 a few of them were broken and things like that.  So, I always pick up these

1 A:  Oh, wha-, what else can I tell you about painting?  
0 isn't enough time, I, I, I fi-, find myself going to work knowing that, that
0 A:  To that switchboard, did you keep getting that it was down?
1 A:  You didn't?
0 anything else to say about painting.
1 A:  It hurts your back, and it hurts your arm.
1 B:  Yeah, you know it [laughter].  I get a so-, I get a sore neck from looking
0 A:  On your baseboards?
0 B:  Um, -kay.
0 not have any voting privileges, though, and I don't believe they have any
0 representation in Congress.
0 always join the military service.  They are considered citizens, I believe.
1 B:  Yeah, that's a strange situation, you're a citizen, yet you can't vote.

0 It's, it, down there, if, um, if you're familiar with their politics, they,

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Well, did you have guides from the area, or escorts or, uh,
0 very foreign, very different.  The, the people, they, they didn't treat them
1 attaining a fifty-first state is what would we do about our flag.  How do you
1 arrange fifty-one stars?  [laughter].
1 A:  What kind of pattern does, do we come up with for that?
1 B:  I don't know.  That, that's a good one [laughter].
1 A:  Uh, yeah, I really don't see any change in the near future.
1 B:  So, I don't know.  [music] And it's also a long way away [laughter].
0 A:  Right.  That is a good distance.
0 makes up, I mean, enough to be like eight or ten percent of their business.
0 A:  Yeah.  I think it must have a lot of tourism, too, but I don't see as much
0 A:  what I'm going to have. 
0 because I think people get tired of eating junk.  I mean, I think they like to
1 B:  Oh, definitely.  I think better even than, than other kinds of food
0 A:  and even banana if you can do it just before you leave. 
0 A:  Yeah.   
1 B:  and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat (( )).
0 A:  Then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because, you know,
0 B:  Right.  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah, ther-, you know, if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better,
0 Florida, so.
1 B:  Oh, well, that's good because I know they've been really expensive lately.
0 B:  Because they weren't in season, of course, they had to be, be, uh, grown in
1 B:  Well,
0 you put it on a really low heat.
0 know, it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch,
1 A:  our mothers used to use it.  And then,
0 A:  something she had collected out of WOMAN'S DAY or something.
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 stick the spoon right in this.
0 A:  but, um, I, my father always told me if you put hot food in your
0 B:  Right, that's true.  I knew that. 
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Plays for the Raiders.
0 A:  and during a tackle he ended up either damaging his hip or, you know,
0 knows arthritis and it could be actually a career ending injury.
0 itself.
1 B:  Uh, I wouldn't know what to do with it.   
1 B:  We're just discussing what we'd do with five thousand.   
0 B:  Well, that's not necessarily true though.  You know, uh, I'm an avid, uh,
1 B:  and I know that the coach there gets a million dollars when he quits,
0 A:  Yeah [laughter]. 
1 B:  You know, yeah, I don't know if it would be dishonest or honest though
1 @@B:  Yeah, well, we veered from the subject.   
0 have some kind of normal conversation.
1 B:  I hope so.   
0 B:  Uh, half-and-half.   
0 with no summer.
0 general, the opinion among, among the, uh, meteorologists at, uh, I'm, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 A:  #Really?  Oh, I'm a car# buff too, we ought to wor-, talk about that one day,
0 A:  Uh, oh, ye-, i-, the same thing about the war, uh, or related to the war
0 on, I was watching C N N and I cannot remember what station it was, what, did
0 that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total
0 B:  Uh, e-,
0 A:  It must have been channel thirteen, I don't recall, although, I thought it
0 a problem in this, the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel, burning fuel,
0 with the car, but, uh, I think people are, would be interested if you had one,
0 B:  And now the valley is not and so people move out ((one more)) valley and,
0 A:  Well, you said you were car buff, uh, I think that, uh, all of us could use
0 A:  Yeah.  I, I think, uh, there could be a lot of ((peo-, I thi-,)) people
0 A:  Yeah, they've got a, they've got a area over in, the ((S M)) building too
0 yeah, I mean, we want to not pollute, but, uh, at a dollar a gallon, uh, it's
0 B:  the amount of energy you get from, uh,
0 was just pure automobiles.
0 uh, of course, they're burning gasoline, of course.
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 it seems like I keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  [Laughter] Tried it on and decided I really did not like how it looked on
1 me.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
1 B:  So, and that was, thirty minutes was definitely plenty.   
0 A:  Doesn't sound like low impact.   
0 A:  Well.  
0 B:  So,
0 A:  Well, I, like, I am undisciplined in the sense that I can't just go and do
0 A:  -- I, I like to get exercise when I'm playing a game of some sort, and so
0 would really like to start that again, because I am now, you know, not in a
0 A:  -- and so that has made me, but I, I'm not the kind of person that could go
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 B:  Well, I don't, you know, a lot of people, I have a girlfriend that goes for
1 the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the
0 A:  Well, I guess it's getting late.  
1 A:  And I should take off, but, uh, I appreciate that, that helped me, helped
0 [talking] Women probably understand that better than the men do.
1 A:  Yeah, I would imagine women would understand maternity a lot better than
1 men [laughter].
1 A:  We only have to get up, you know, for the daytime feedings. 
0 B:  [Laughter] So I think that, that's a good benefit, I think, having women,
0 uh, in, in higher up positions, stuff like that.
1 the feminists,
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 A:  And it's, it's confusing trying to figure out which one is which.
1 A:  I think they should all wear signs.   
1 fat to go.
1 problem that the men has had,
0 is in a lot of jobs, you know, like the firemen, you know, for a long time
0 A:  Well, I think if, you know, regardless of sex, whether you can, if you can
0 A:  That's,   
1 A:  rather than qualifications.  
0 B:  Exactly, same with a doctor [laughter].   
1 A:  Yeah, that's true.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, 
0 you know, his, you know, and that never has offended me when, you know, when
1 A:  A wait person.  
0 thought, but [breathing] some women like to fight it.  But,
1 A:  I think her background totally bothers me.   
1 refer to him as the first husband?
0 Strauss and she's a, uh, first woman mayor so.
1 a female,
1 large, you know,
0 Dallas, one in Houston, we got a female governor and there's two or three more
0 B:  That's really good, I guess.   
0 B:  I am surprised, though, that we do have so many that are in politics down
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  
1 A:  If you could mobilize the mothers you got them.   
0 doesn't automatically mean y-, it shouldn't mean that you get promoted to that
1 A:  Yeah {faint}. 
0 A:  Wha-, what do you use to, to download into the system.  Can you p-, hook up
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 curious what you'd use your, uh, your home computer for.
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 typically deal with, uh, uh, Lotus, uh, WordPerfect which is a spreadsheet --
0 B:  Right.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 ((Ishihara)), uh, quality analysis?
1 B:  That's tremendous.   
1 secretaries had nothing to do.  Uh, and, and that, I guess part of that is
0 B:  That, that's been my experience also.  I've actually, I guess I've been
1 secretaries, but, they're piling more and more people onto that one secretary.
0 A:  Oh, uh, I, I have a laser printer, I have access to a laser printer in my
0 B:  Huh, because what I was, what I was going to ask you is, it seems like the
0 are you familiar with, uh, programs like Harvard Graphics?
0 B:  Interesting.  Yeah, that's, uh, that's, uh, pretty powerful, uh, set of
1 A:  Oh, yeah I can remember at one time the, the, uh, secretaries actually had
0 B:  Covered enough of, of this for, for what this is all about. 
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  So that might lead you to a biased, uh, decision perhaps, if you
0 A:  I would think so.
0 her guilty she would simply flee the state and avoid any prosecution of any
1 A:  -- and she did flee the state.  But,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  I think so.
1 B:  [Laughter] We could go on.
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 on the edge of a development that has a little retainer wall that separates us
0 B:  Oh, no.   
0 wall is a triangle shape and the wedge part of the triangle got too skinny to
0 B:  Oh, okay.  I live in Dal-, uh, Rowlett.   
0 way.  We're on the beginning of a corner.  We live on a, on a U-shaped drive
1 us really likes taking care of all that grass, so,
0 A:  -- it tends to, uh, uh, go to the extremes of being dry or being moist and
1 don't, uh, close just right and, uh, things of that nature.
0 and inspected our damage was saying that there are some little, little pockets
1 of neighborhoods that don't have these problems at all, and had I only known
1 [laughter], maybe I'd have looked over there.
1 next house is going to sit square in the middle of at least ten acres of land
1 B:  Sometime. 
0 There's a lot of things you're not sure about what to look out for.
0 B:  The only really trouble we've had with our house is the seals breaking
1 A:  Nothing you can do.   
1 strange mechanical beast,
0 B:  -- they wouldn't, that insurance company went out of business in Texas
1 A:  Yeah and it would be nice to do it with, with all the same kind, too
0 [laughter].
1 A:  Well, I hear my kid calling me,
0 B:  Okay, well, it was good talking to you.  
0 else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  And if you've been in for twelve years, I'm sure you've,
1 B:  But, uh, I get, I just couldn't ima-, I mean it's more money that I make in
1 a year, so [laughter],
0 the college years it's,
0 education is it's really the time, yes, you do get an education, you do learn
1 A:  Yeah, in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion
0 B:  Well, your education's a lot what you make of it, too, so, 
0 B:  Yeah.    
1 got a lot of, uh, M I T graduates that are in there and they are the biggest
1 B:  Yeah, and they have their own quirks and tolerances and,
0 doctorate research,
1 B:  Nope.   
0 when you were talking, but the service academies have all, all the faculty,
0 B:  schools.  But, uh, having the military faculty is really beneficial
1 is third down on the list of importance things and,
0 A:  So I'd say go to a, go to a college that has teachers.  People who really
1 B:  Yeah.   
0 wonder if, if ((they enter)) these conversations that people have been having,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, or, I saw ((CHIMA PARA DISO)).   
0 A:  It's a foreign film.   
0 A:  he ran a machine. 
0 A:  I, I thought they did an excellent job of actually aging the person, you
1 probably all these really good looking young people, you know, yeah.
0 A:  Like, for example, TEQUILA SUNRISE, I liked that.   
0 B:  Yeah, well that, well that was, that's with, uh, who's, what's his name's
0 was good.  I,
0 you know, suspenseful.
0 B:  Yeah, we're, we're going to go see that, probably tonight.  
0 B:  But I didn't think it was really weird.  You know, not as weird as, I don't
0 A:  About what?.   
1 A:  I don't, I don't like to look too deep into movies.  If it's good, it's
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
1 can you not like something,
0 impression, too.
0 A:  Oliver Stone, isn't it?   
0 B:  -- you know, so probably if you liked his other two movies, uh, those are,
0 like, WALL STREET, and PLATOON then,
0 A:  But I didn't see WALL STREET.   
1 A:  I guess they wouldn't be called dialects, but they're pretty close
0 movies for a dollar.  Sometimes they're even free.
0 A:  They were, they were.   
1 B:  and it's like, it's just like that.  So that's why I liked it.  I guess
1 B:  My husband.   
0 B:  Well, I'm big into the plant, I like the, the flower beds and plants a lot
0 better than I do the lawn.
1 vegetables.
0 B:  Um.
0 pots just on our steps and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers.  Like right now
0 B:  Yeah, container gardening is really pretty easy because I've done some of
1 twice a day, because it gets so hot in the summer.
1 A:  Yeah, well, we wouldn't have to worry about that [laughter]. 
0 B:  Well, we've got a beautiful day and there are people out everywhere.  All
0 B:  Because otherwise it's too, it gets, if you start them when it's cooler in
1 A:  Yeah.   
0 because see there's a lot of the, uh, first, you know, first the big wave of
1 taco salad is.
0 B:  Maybe so.   
0 going to be moving, we're talking about just putting, throwing tomatoes in --
0 A:  Would you have to stake them up, do, aren't they, do they grow,
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 than that, but to cover an area, so you co-, you put them eight inches apart,
0 B:  That can help.  You just get to a point where they're just not productive
0 A:  Yeah, rotationary thing.    
1 A:  Uh, yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, because everybody else is growing --   
1 A:  well, but you grew your own tomatoes.   
1 B:  area part of the time.  I mix, all, all my flower beds are mixed up.  I've
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  I just don't, I hate mowing [laughter].   
1 A:  Yeah, I guess the more the plant, the less you have to mow. 
0 A:  it's when it's self propelled it's heavy, yeah.   
0 doesn't bother him and h-, I'm got out and mowed for him one day just to be
0 nice so he wouldn't have to do it when he got home, and I said, what is with
1 this mower, I can't even push it around the yard.
1 B:  And, you know, he's like, well, I get more exercise pushing it around.
0 he was looking for a lawn mower and he --
1 A:  because it meant something for your macho.   
1 A:  Same reason why he has to drive a big truck with four wheels, you know.
0 A:  Four wheel drive.  It was a macho thing.  He had to use that, but then
0 pretty well that way,
1 cutting the grass he's probably thinking about something else.
1 B:  Well, we differ there.   
0 A:  [Laughter].   
0 out on Friday and, I don't know say take a hit of Ecstasy and dance all night.
0 going to go out and, you know, substitute something else for maybe what they
1 B:  Yeah. 
1 have to agree there, nothing worse than a, I can remember staying in bed a
0 Friday night and maybe, you know, I don't have to work till Monday, and if I
1 you know, I'm going to feel like crap,
0 know it, you know, you're, you're always doing it.
0 counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work.
1 know.
0 B:  That's what you would think, but I kind of,
0 A:  Okay.
0 A:  Now see, that I wouldn't agree with.  See, see I think you got to be able
0 example.
0 A:  Ooh.
0 drugs legal or marijuana legal then we, the we wouldn't be going through this.
1 B:  No.
0 A:  And get hurt.
1 to the health center and, you know, pee in a jar or whatever it is.
0 B:  I have to, I have to honestly say that I drink more now than I did because,
1 used to drink, okay you go out and you want to party and that's, that's
1 something you do when you're young and dumb I guess [laughter], you know.
1 don't smoke, I gave everything up, so I guess, I don't know what, just old age
0 B:  I don't smoke, I quit doing that, and I've tried to quit drinking but it's,
1 know.  Is --
0 A:  Into my bloodstream [laughter].
0 B:  I said opposing viewpoints.   
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 hundred percent listener supported.
0 channel two and thirty-six also, that, are publicly supported.  And they have
1 A:  I've avoided the temptation so far, but I sure do miss P B S.
0 B:  Yep.   
0 A:  -- and nature.   
0 B:  And it gives you a lot more, uh, of the other, you know, of the widest, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.  I, I had cable before I, uh, came up here and I miss some of it.  I
0 B:  Yep, right.   
0 B:  And I love that.   
1 A:  I'm having C N N withdrawal pains.   
1 A:  Yeah, it's crowded.  I know that.   
1 worst horror show.
0 A:  Seems like drivers are getting worse and worse every year.  
1 A:  down there and brought this thing up and I, yeah, sure I'll do it.
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].   
0 B:  I don't know the city.   
1 B:  No.   
1 A:  No, matter fact we don't have any big ones [laughter].   
1 A:  you know, they, people think Charlotte is the big town, you know
0 B:  Oh, wow.   
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 A:  but it's certainly small by Atlanta standards.   
0 A:  But, uh, if you, if you miss it at the right time of the day, then you're
0 B:  [Laughter] The airport's something down there.   
0 A:  departure and arrival, uh,  
0 B:  Unreal.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  I went there to, to visit the Underground when that was, you know the
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah.   
0 B:  Amazing. 
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#   
0 A:  Because it certainly wasn't sustained.   
0 did everything in, because he wasn't really paying attention to business, you
1 A:  You can't trust legislators anyway.   
0 B:  [Laughter] No.  Well, it's been interesting talking to you. 
1 A:  Yeah, we n-, we didn't talk too much about music, but we had a good
1 conversation [laughter].
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  Yeah, we, he p-, we plant quite a bit, and we have the, you know, peach
0 and raid it.
0 A:  Makes you wonder what they're, what they're sending out.  I mean,
0 A:  Yeah, where is it.
0 B:  Yeah, where is it, I know they have to grow some of it.
0 A:  Because certainly they're not using it for juices and stuff,
1 A:  -- gosh, if they're using junk for that, what are we getting here.
0 A:  Well, I started,  
1 A:  Yeah, these two cats, it's hard to keep anything around.   
1 A:  Yeah, really.   
1 A:  These, these cats are just about as bad as kids.   
0 A:  Yeah, she,  
1 A:  You never know.   
1 B:  That's right [laughter].   
1 A:  Kitty cat, what do you think about being a star [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].   
1 B:  That's right, you can buy lots of cat food with that so,  
0 A:  and all that stuff. 
0 A:  Well, I'm, I'm pretty easy as far as yard work.  I'll go out there and cut
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  Yeah, well, we had a real warm day today and all the neighbors were out,
0 B:  Oh, do you have a lot of that kind of weather there in North Carolina?
1 A:  Yeah, it's, I don't know I was expecting snow and all of that.
0 get some more, because if they don't they're going to have water problems this
0 A:  -- golly, it's, it's unbelievable the extremes in weather up there.
1 A:  Yeah, I, I've been thinking about it.   
1 B:  What, Brittany?  Okay, good hon {speaker is talking to child}.  Sorry,
0 B:  Oh, yeah.  She, she was wanting,  
0 B:  Yeah, I hear you just fine.   
0 A:  it makes it a little easier.   
0 B:  Yeah, he works for them right now.  He's been there almost six years now.
0 A:  Yeah.  I had a, I had an interesting call about, uh, two weeks ago.  Uh,
1 anything, so I took it and the subject was, discuss the weather,
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Oh.  
1 A:  [Laughter].   
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh, well, you really kind of have the same kind of weather.
1 A:  I mean, yeah, gosh, what's your weather like, you know. 
1 A:  Well, I don't know, let me look out my window.  Yeah, it's kind of foggy
1 tonight [laughter].
0 out of their house because of the --
1 A:  Oh.  
0 A:  Oh.  Sounds like that young one wants some attention.   
1 B:  Oh, I, she's talking to my husband, I think so,    
0 A:  That's too bad, because I,
0 a disaster area.
0 B:  What {speaker talking to child}. 
0 A:  It's a shame.   
1 A:  something.   
0 gardens for a long, long time.  When I was a kid, I started, uh, I had some
0 A:  And I grew a thirty-four and a half pound watermelon.   
0 B:  Oh, my word.   
0 A:  Yeah, absolutely tasteless.   
0 B:  We tr-, grew cantaloupe last year and that's how they were, just tasteless.
0 was, you know, blah,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 bring themselves to sentence someone.
0 time which happened in the state of Florida happened to be, uh, death.  But,
1 A:  Yeah, I think that was a logical decision there.   
0 because I think if, but I, I've never served on a jury, you probably know this
0 though.  It's, it depends on the, the tr-, they can ask, uh, points of order
1 A:  But, the, uh, defendant took the stand on his own behalf and unfortunately
1 A:  Uh, I work for E Systems.   
1 to the topic.
1 A:  Okay [laughter].   
1 B:  And, uh, so I've heard the name and, uh, well, back to the topic
1 uh, dog just ran off with my shoe, [laughter] that's off the subject,
0 B:  went outside, picked it up and ran off.  Anyway, uh, and then we switched
0 comes on at, like the nine o'clock p m and so I will turn that on while I'm
1 Arnett, and, uh, the, the news coverage?
0 because uh, it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain
1 variety to choose from.
0 A:  Yeah, my husband does and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes,
1 switcher.
0 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].  
1 A:  Um.  Well I am, we're fairly new to the area and so we're still shopping
0 know, some females, I don't recall that they have any female anchors and I
0 A:  Yeah.
1 little too cutesy but, 
1 B:  Yeah.  Have you been doing anything outside in this great weather?
0 B:  Yeah, I know we had a tornado w-, watch, uh, couple of days ago, but
1 B:  Yeah, we did, w-, they're always mild to me compared to New York winters.
0 B:  [Laughter] Have you have been to New York in the winter.   
0 to the weather.  I, the summers don't bother me anymore at all.
1 it's going to be hot again.
0 A:  I was in Wisconsin over the Christmas holidays --  
0 A:  So it's stayed cold for the entire week.   
1 B:  Not necessarily, not the ice.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  Yeah.  I just think it's really, really pretty.   
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Well, that's not uncommon.   
0 B:  That was so strange to me having lived in New York, you know.
0 down.
1 B:  Not, 
1 A:  we usually have to make them up, though, so [laughter].   
1 A:  I think it's supposed to be nice, though.   
0 A:  Yeah, somewhat, uh --  
0 A:  Waiting for the, wai-, waiting for the weather to get nice out so I can go
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 A:  Well, you've got a lot more control over the inside temperature that you
1 A:  And they sit in the sun too long and dry up or, uh, if I don't put them in
0 outside.  I hope it is anyway because, uh, softball season starts and we're
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  Yeah, hot.   
0 A:  Yeah.   
1 B:  You know, I mean they're not the, the typical country where they're just,
1 you know, my wife left me, my dog left me, you know [laughter].
0 B:  But,  
1 B:  No.   
1 A:  Very badly.   
0 to learn, so we all had to take lessons, and I was the one that did the least
1 poorly, so she gave it to me.
1 B:  What's that?   
0 A:  I said so do I, I forgot about jazz [laughter].   
0 you have to remember, you know, as far as singing a song or something like
0 with it --
0 A:  -- and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music.
0 their names of the song, but I, I can identify them.  But I like that and I
0 B:  And, uh,  
1 pieces and, and I played classical flute, I didn't play, play jazz flute or
1 A:  Yeah.   
0 I like, uh, Hebert, uh, oh, you don't know Hebert Laws, but Hebert Laws a
1 A:  Yeah.   
0 B:  Yeah, I like Chuck Mangione [laughter].  Trying to think of all, uh, oh,
0 nowadays, that's it's easy listening.
1 B:  Yeah.   
0 B:  Oh, you must live in this area.   
0 B:  We're in Sherman.   
1 B:  Oh, okay.  You're going to Commerce?   
0 B:  Yeah, East Texas is recruiting for,  
0 that in the area.
1 A:  They're not going to recruit me anymore, I'm through.   
1 B:  [Laughter].   
1 legal assistant and that's what I know, so, and, uh, just nothing basically
1 I'm really interested in legal, you know, in the legal environment, but I
1 A:  This guy had supposedly, uh, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton
0 June.
0 that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman [talking]
0 B:  Oh, well they'll, 
1 B:  Well,  
0 necessarily be taken off the jury, you know, not be accepted for j-, the jury.
0 A:  You know. 
0 B:  there, there they would have a doubt about you,
0 in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, you know, not
0 B:  Okay they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars,
0 be exactly that, someone in your own age bracket, someone that, you know, you
0 the, the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial.
0 B:  And it's not working either.   
0 at, now our jails are overcrowded.  We just built a brand new one two years
0 B:  Yeah that,   
0 A:  -- like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor,  
0 by such and such a time, they're instructed, uh, so that, this, this
0 where they know their whereabouts.
0 you know,
0 wrong.  I came from California --
0 A:  More than that.   
0 A:  More than that. 
0 for their own.
0 A:  Absolutely. 
0 B:  the jury gets to see the whole trial, as does the judge, but you know,
0 so I'm just going to throw the book at you.
0 to three years and,
1 B:  And, you know, we're supposed to be, and I quote, in a democratic society.
0 A:  [Laughter].   
0 B:  So, you know, if you can find me guilty, then you ought to be able to pass
0 A:  The thing that I, I don't really like, I, I don't know, if, uh, a lot of
1 forty-niners to win.
1 haven't produced since then but, 
0 B:  No [laughter].   
0 they win or lose, why the fun is, is, in the supporting them.
1 A:  Every Sunday and Monday.   
0 A:  It's, either A B C or N B C, one or the other, I think.  I'm not too sure.
0 B:  Um.  Well, uh, I haven't, for some reason have never really gotten enthused
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, and, uh, it just seems like it should only be done in cold
0 A:  But it takes a good while for it to get cold.   
0 A:  But, couple, couple Christmases ago we had a, a freak storm and I live near
0 than anybody else.
1 before,
1 A:  Yeah, well we had, like, layers of clothing to keep away the snow.
0 B:  Well, that helps doesn't it [laughter].
1 you got hit and you fell, you didn't really feel it.
0 now?
0 upper sixties, maybe lower seventies right now.
0 church it cooled off again.  So much so that I, uh, stopped at home to change
0 up, been with us all day {pause}. Well,
1 A:  Yeah, this is the first time I've talked with someone up north.
1 A:  Seems like they have ninety percent of the people calling from Texas.
1 B:  Right [laughter].   
1 have to say is that we probably need to pay our teachers a little bit more --
0 A:  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
0 They were not too, too bad at that time.  And I was fortunate enough to have
0 to look at one thing, we've lost, oh, kids used to have a respect for the
0 education and to teaching and then they looked and saw how much money they got
0 graduating colleges, you know, or across the country, want to go jumping into
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  I mean, they, they, uh, go home and grade papers, lesson plans, prepare for
0 the work-, [breathing] --
1 A:  That's right across the country.  I don't think I could s-,
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 forty-niners are about to do.
0 they've done a good job in the last few years of, of getting rid of their
0 B:  Right.   
1 A:  But I like, uh, I like the Giants.  I, I kind of think they snuck into the
0 A:  Yes.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 years, uh, they had a, you know, they had a chance to, but, uh, I don't think
0 A:  He, they never even missed a beat.   
1 super team.  Course, I'm being up here in the northeast corner, I kind of like
1 these northeast teams [laughter].
1 A:  Now they're, now they're trying to move the team somewhere else last I
0 heard.  [breathing] Boy just kind of [laughter].
0 it's just their strength will beat him, you know, sometimes.
0 B:  Yeah.  Well they were, they were talk-, I think I was watching, uh, the N C
1 B:  get all the money th-, you know.  
0 A:  You know, if you're not up for three innings or whatever but, 
1 B:  And you don't get hit.   
1 A:  [Laughter] the key right there, yeah.   
0 B:  They, it may have been a misquote.
0 B:  Yeah, I was, I, I was kind of surprised that, uh, that the Royals let him
0 go with a football career as long as they did, you know.
1 A:  And Terry Bradshaw I think is probably even better than he is.  Or better,
1 A:  Another black and yellow surfacing up here, you know.
1 B:  [Laughter].   
0 like Bradshaw as a quarterback and I think, uh, Joe Montana's probably one of
0 the finest and John Elway, I believe that fellow, if he had some different
0 B:  Well that's, uh, I agree with you there.  I mean, he didn't have the
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 through the Sullivans that, that owned the team, you know,
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 anyway so,
0 B:  All right.   
0 A:  Okay, come on up.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 A:  And I, I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible
0 A:  to where a just really want to read it.   
0 B:  Frank E. Peretti [whispering].

0 B:  That's good.   
0 B:  [Sniffing] Right.    
0 B:  Well, that's neat.  Well, I [throat_clearing], I have a, my daughter has
1 you know, uh, gosh, if, if I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd
1 A:  Well, it's hard for me.   
1 B:  That's right [laughter]. 
0 B:  It is, it is real hard to, to follow and understand,  
0 A:  Uh-huh, that's right.
0 B:  No you can't, you really can't.  They are good and ooh they just, they're
1 A:  Uh, there's another guy.  Oh, what can, what is his name [lipsmack].
1 re-, remem-,
1 B:  Oh.
1 B:  [Breathing] Yeah, oh, I think I know who you're talking about.  Uh, I've
0 B:  Are similar.   
1 B:  Yeah, it really was, and I loved THE SHINING.   
1 B:  Yeah, yeah.   
1 my gosh if they show that,
1 B:  Yeah, I think they did a pretty good job, but [throat_clearing],
1 A:  [Laughter] I'm a dog lover.   
1 B:  Me, too [laughter]. 
1 A:  Yeah, he's so prolific.   
0 A:  -- and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit, too, uh,

0 A:  -- their worthwhile.   
1 B:  No that was another one.
1 A:  he wrote JANE EHRE, too [laughter].   
1 B:  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, well, you know who I'm talking about [laughter].
0 B:  -- uh, have my daughter and teach Sunday school and go to school, myself,
1 B:  I think we have, too.   
1 A:  well, we try, like here they show it, like, every day.   
1 A:  and then they show the TWILIGHT ZONE at one thirty,
1 shelves everywhere and we didn't have enough books to fill it up but, 
1 A:  Oh, do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE?  What?  He's got what? 
1 asked me to dance.
1 and go, what!
1 A:  you better be so,  
1 A:  Yeah.   
1 A:  Well, I like, I, I just, I just bogused on all my homework so it really
1 B:  Cool, yeah, B S that's the way to do it.   
0 A:  Yeah, I know, and I did that all through college and it worked [laughter].
0 B:  No, unless, 
1 A:  And were here, and I go, so what happened worldwide, you know.
1 somewhere else, they're not going to tell you, you know,
1 guard who's a hundred and five years old,
1 A:  -- but then we started watching it.   
0 B:  Oh, really, that's cool.
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  -- uh, they go, s-, some girl goes, do you ((dares)) want to go to a
1 picnic, right.  I hear no, we're just, you know, it's like we just woke up,
1 ((ourself)) to watching golf --
0 A:  they have better computer science up here than they, than they do down
0 there.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  And so then I said, I'm going to move back up there to go to college.
0 A:  Yeah.  So, but it's, a, it's just, you know, oh, well, we've been talking
0 A:  That's the only obligation we have.   
0 the other way when things began to go sourer maybe.
0 A:  I'm not sure.   
1 B:  whole thing [laughter].   
0 B:  Okay.   
0 dollars insurance on it.
0 insurance by the reserve, then I don't think this would have happened.
0 A:  [Breathing].
1 A:  Um, I think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it
0 B:  or whether (( )).  
0 B:  To be caught in the (( )).  
0 articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their
0 out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost.
0 since is it was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up
0 B:  And given that the S and Ls have had disasters then those account holders
0 are, are, their money is still being protected.
0 maybe that needs to be thought about, rethought.
1 me like they've gotten around what was [laughter],
1 B:  intended to be the issue there.   
1 went bankrupt.
0 B:  because that means,  
0 B:  It will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here
1 B:  Had some health problems that have led me to, uh, I'd say more on than off
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year
0 bought myself a solo flex machine, I don't know if you've seen those
1 now.
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, a lot of things do that. I had an,
1 B:  Yeah, it's nice because when the weathers bad you can't, you don't have any
0 A:  I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold so thought
0 your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 dirt to jog on.
0 A:  But,
1 A:  Yeah, I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often my don't get very much
0 basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile, but then I'll get tired
0 week.
1 B:  Yeah, well, don't let it collect dust.  At least exercise while dusting it
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a
1 A:  Uh, I need to,  
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  so I'm upset [laughter],  
1 A:  Yeah.   
0 B:  [Laughter].   
0 A:  on T V?   
1 B:  [Laughter].   
1 A:  Okay [laughter].   
1 B:  There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N, I don't know if he's still on
0 any more or not, I don-, I don't know if I get E S P N or not [laughter].
1 A:  (( )).    
1 B:  Yeah, I watched that cause he was cute [laughter].   
1 B:  [Laughter].   
0 B:  Are the-, yeah they're still, they're still, he's still doing it then, uh.
0 A:  Yeah, every morning.   
0 A:  It's on E S P N, uh, at what time, I can't remember what time.  It's, uh,
1 A:  check, check it back up, and, but the thing is everybody always looks so
1 A:  uh, I haven't done so much as, uh, watch the tape that I made. 
0 @@B:  Well, that's thought, I haven't thought about that, well they're going to
1 beep us pretty soon.
0 A:  to you about exercise and fitness.   
0 turn out is less, just because people figure why bother, you know, what's the
0 the ten four one verses the fourteen one election here in Dallas a while back.
0 were a lot of, of minorities that wanted it to go the way that it didn't go
1 don't want to be called for jury duty or --
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh.
0 A:  you can, uh, weed out the ones that you really want to,  
0 B:  Well, last November was my first election in Dallas.  I've only lived in
0 Dallas a little over a year, and I went down this long list of judges that I
1 get just as good of results as if I through darts at a board.
0 off the candidate's personal information, then you want to get into an actual
0 deal with, uh, any personality quirk, or any negatives that they've found, or
0 any sk-, skeleton in the closet --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 listen to either side of a given issue --
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  -- uh, and it's pretty difficult to deal with some of the issues, lets say
0 that, uh, Texas State, uh, Rail Road Commission has to solve, when you don't
1 than any place I've ever been.
0 A:  So, [smack] there's more apathy [laughter] I guess, 
0 B:  Well,
0 A:  Huh.  Boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important,
1 just to do away with the cost of the elections,
0 A:  one man who can, at least, get his party together.  
0 don't have time to educate the public on these matters, because the public is
0 not going to sit still and si-, soak the message in.
1 in the line itself,
0 A:  but unfortunately, since there are so many other things that, uh, our
0 it's a not important election, as it were, they only opened a few of the
0 guess this is the kind of thing you expect from the newspapers.
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  That's true.  [smack] With so many elected officials, I guess there's just
1 B:  [Breathing] We used the five up.  
1 A:  Yeah, at least [laughter].  
0 A:  Bye.  
0 A:  That's right.  That's,
0 an appeal that says it was, you know, an unjust amount of time,
0 B:  -- or whatever.  This is what's going to happen.  
0 B:  don't know what else to do with some of these people,
0 B:  #and over,# 
0 B:  I know, I, you read about it in the paper, 
0 A:  Yes.  
0 punishment is.  You know, I, I,
0 B:  -- and people like Charles Manson, and, and some of these other people, who
0 A:  [Cough].
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 doesn't it,
0 B:  -- and then he gets up for this one trial, and they don't finds anything
1 B:  Yeah,  
0 A:  And a lots of things.
0 the small towns now though, has really changed from when I was a kid, but now
0 B:  -- and I was back on the time, and now I don't let my kids out of the front
0 A:  See them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really is.  Well, we're probably fixing to run
0 A:  Bye -- 
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 B:  in that, in that time frame.  
0 in my life very much in,
0 keepers.
0 B:  And, this is what I find particularly difficult in that, uh, if we see
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 guy.  If your brother or your sister were being beaten,
0 A:  Yeah.  It is a difficult thing.  But then, vengeance is mine sayeth the
0 B:  (( )). 
0 see the same thing, and that now he builds roads so, then it (( )) and then he
0 the poor farmer, the poor rice farmer, was going to pay taxes --
0 B:  -- and the question is, who was he going to pay it to?
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  -- to go beat up on people, and I think that, I think we need to, a little
0 A:  Yeah.  But then again, yeah, I'd say it is wrong to (( )) and I'm not
0 Vietnam war, because I'm going to interpret that, through the Bible, and I've
0 A:  (( )) the sheep.  Yeah.  
1 B:  and that, that, you know, and you, I think that's one of those things
0 A:  But then again, though ((Jesus)) the grace pushes you beyond the law, you
0 know what I'm saying, like, so he didn't just say, don't kill your, don't kill
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  -- what do you do, turn the other cheek?  
0 holy spirit to deal with pride over that.  Do you see what I mean?
0 with all the killing, but I'm not a new ager, I don't believe (( )) I am not
0 Especially in the minority n-, neighborhoods.
0 A:  They have very specific programs that, uh, that are being implemented at
0 uh, because they also pay the teachers, I think, much better than others
0 something like six months --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 they'll have some proposal and then, someone won't like it for some reason, or
0 A:  -- and, uh, it's always occurred to me that, that, uh, you know, I've been
0 paid the most I think, or paid, the most I think you know, significantly more,
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Well, I mean, uh, they, no more punishment, per se --
0 B:  It's, uh,
0 teachers are just afraid to teach.  You know, are they going to, or they go to
1 things that sort of happens to be shured up, you know, in or educational
0 B:  Well, possibly.  I think it does, uh, I'm not sure I think it does some,
0 uh, it, it, it, it may sort of lead to some, uh, it, it, it may just be
0 say things, and sort of do things together, so possibly --
0 prayer --
0 B:  But, uh, we've, like I say, we've been redistricting here in Dallas, has
0 A:  Oh. Well, hopefully they'll resolve it soon.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 public school, but, I can't imagine having to raise a kid now, and, and have
1 B:  -- (( )),
0 A:  No.  I,  
0 A:  advertise that they give it, you can earn up to ten or twenty thousand
0 two years paid for.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah.  Did you move from the Northeast? 
0 income tax.  That he said that year, he claimed, he had, he didn't have to pay
0 systems that we pay taxes to support and all that makes us feel bad.  But I
0 personal property taxes on like cars and, the first year we were there it was
1 dollars to get licensed in Texas and now,
1 something.
0 A:  Right. 
0 just kind of ((given)) the money,
1 I wish that they would, I guess, because I'm not one of them [laughter],
1 better let you go.
0 A:  No.  No.  They just define it to you and so,
1 A:  you get what, uh, get luck of the draw but,
1 B:  Yeah [laughter]. 
0 B:  #Okay.#  You want to start? 
1 B:  -- Master Charge. 
0 A:  [Laughter] I don't have a Master Charge, thank you [laughter].
0 after us would, oh, man, it would be so good.  It would be so much better.  It
0 B:  Well, now I agree, uh --
1 we'll have a discussion here.
0 qualified to get it.  I didn't need it.  And it would have been a little
0 rough, I might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli,
1 B:  Very simple.  Just take all these civil service employees, 
1 Day, President's Day,
0 B:  #what a, a# week, I think we here at T I get a total of eleven a year.
1 A:  Yeah, that is true.  Because I always think the mail never comes on these
1 days and you're like, well, what is it [laughter].  You don't even know it's a
0 A:  It's not?
0 A:  That's why it keeps going up, uh? 
1 B:  You know, I could --
0 B:  -- I can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail, uh, uh,
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  They probably, hey, I ought to go looking through some of my old mail.
0 because I know that Bush is real for the new world order.  The one world
1 U S Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency, and I've seen
0 not pure, it just backfires, I mean, none of these nations have paid us back.
0 that's the problem.  And I don't mean give it to everybody that asks.  Use a

1 B:  You should have taken the larger one, huh?  [Laughter].  
0 than, I, and, so when I came along, I was interested in, fooling with the
0 and, uh, in fact I started doing a layout, uh, in our garage at one time, but,

0 [laughter].
1 B:  Uh.  
1 A:  -- and, uh, he kind of not happy I've got it now [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter].   
1 A:  [Laughter] I'm, I'm not going to give it back.  
1 A:  So, it's, it's sitting on display on top of my book case.  
0 ignore some of these museums, because a lot of them are called childrens

0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  It really is.  
0 A:  but that, it, you know, I think that also goes along, uh, the reason why
0 B:  A lot more waste, yeah.  
0 B:  Uh-huh, true.
0 A:  so, we, you know, we'll go there instead of, you know, just going to a

0 B:  Huh-uh.  Mike Riley was it.  And that's,
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Wh-, he doesn't have that Hollywood attitude. 
0 their major players, he actually put on a uniform and went out and played.
0 B:  That's all right then.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  once it gets down to like,
1 B:  U N L V, I like them.  
1 A:  Right.  
0 A:  And, uh, I guess, b-, they used laptop computers to, uh, try to get their

0 A:  but, uh, these guys were actually on the road, uh, two thousand miles
0 B:  Yeah.  I don't think that's, I don't think that's good.

0 A:  ((See)), you think, uh, you think Vegas is going to win the finals then?
1 A:  Yeah, uh, somebody took the fire out from under them.  
0 B:  And see if Kansas, if Kan-,

0 B:  Take that,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 B:  He's,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  And Anderson Hunt, all their, uh, their best players, I think, are
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 the, the pro draft.
1 my girlfriend, she, she gets me because I can describe them, go, you know that
1 A:  Sure.  
1 A:  Ever since Akeem changed his, uh, first name to Hakeem. 
1 B:  [Laughter].

1 B:  His attitude [laughter].  I don't know, I don't know them people.
1 A:  Sure.  
0 what's his,
0 A:  They've got good individual players but some are getting old.  Robert
0 talent that will win the N B A this year.
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 Chicago.
1 A:  because I work, and, uh, I have my dogs and I have a hard enough time,

0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 attention.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  that really annoys me because I think, I don't know I think, my parents
0 B:  Which,
0 A:  Well, I've, I've heard some, uh, there's a book out now called, THE
1 A:  And they all have to have the same one, you know.  And,

0 B:  I don't think we have any choice.  
0 hurt the, uh, the peop-, uh, the Vietnam experience, uh, I got to admit that
0 A:  Well, do you think that, um, by, uh, going over there and doing what we did
0 that, uh, it's going to give us a chance for peace over there?
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 one,
0 one and find out it's not much fun.
0 A:  No.
0 B:  So, and ((I mean)), it's not, it's not a lot of fun.  
0 B:  ((Out of some)) degree, yeah.  To some degree but, uh, religion is a factor
1 they want to follow.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 one term president.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, I know.   
0 A:  True.  They want the, the gas guzzlers ((and)),  
0 blown out of the sky,
0 A:  Yeah, I got to agree with you there.  I think that does get a lot, a lot of
0 presence in the Mideast from now on of the,
0 overall.
1 I'm just)) getting out of the olympics and I'm going to give you back Panama.
0 A:  The person I was impressed with most, I mean, I, I really, you know, Colin
0 A:  That's right, I, well, he was what, uh, uh, Senator from Utah or something
1 not used to having them over in six days, you know.
1 A:  [Laughter] I don't think very many people are.  
0 B:  [Laughter] Just kind of, gosh, we just got started good.  
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, unless they finally do take care of it themselves, but, you
1 B:  Yeah.  They shouldn't leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet.
0 know, in the Jimmy Car-, uh, Carter era, you know wringing your hands and
1 going trust me, trust me.
1 @B:  Well, I tell you what it is.  It's warm where I'm at [laughter].  
0 in east Plano or west Plano?
1 different over here.
1 B:  Okay [laughter].  Good deal.
0 like that, you know, I look kind of stupid.  I'm out there in a t-shirt and
1 everything (( )).
0 shoulders and back get sunburned again.
0 A:  #Well, it is# March after all.  You know, you're not supposed to worry 
1 probably have another sandstorm out there, you know.
1 B:  I see, okay.  
1 A:  Hadn't had one like that in a couple of years.  
1 dust storm come in and it started raining, 
1 the air and then it snowed a little bit,
0 seventy-three, they opened up that plant out there in Lubbock and, uh, man,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Warmed backup and killed everything off.  
0 A:  -- #because eventually you're going to lose it.#
1 A:  And you noticed all the pretty little trees that are out everything now.
0 A:  I've got some out here that's five, six years old now and still doesn't
0 A:  I noticed that a lot of the garden, well, you know, that Indian Hawthorne,
1 A:  Yeah.  Well, anyway, uh, like I said, if it doesn't grow out in the woods
0 bushes.  And, uh, like I say, really seem to, to do well.
0 A:  And you go out there and you look at your tree after a good windstorm and
1 the thing is bare and you think, oh, know.
0 these oaks and says, yeah, they grow slow and all that --
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  So.  
0 A:  Well [laughter].  You know, you'd think that this crazy system, if you're
1 B:  Clear across town.  
1 shining and it would be hot down in the, 
0 Americans or, uh, or Hispanics, in that sense, but I think we, uh, are more
1 we should be.  Of course, that's from my own bias since my ancestors from
0 eastern Europe, so [laughter].
0 lobbying for their release and their ability to, um, immigrate from Russia --
1 A:  Huh.
0 both sides.
1 B:  Both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so, I'm a
1 little touchy [throat_clearing] every now and then about that [laughter].
0 here --
1 are.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 unrestricted, uh, not only would, would the United States become over
0 also, uh, uh, diminishing the, uh, health restrictions which,
1 think we should be a little more circumspect about it.  Again, my opinion
1 @@B:  Think we've talked long enough?  
1 A:  I think so [laughter].  
1 B:  I, I, I have talked long enough.  
1 A:  Okay [laughter].  
1 many years, now.  So,
0 B:  I have to agree that [laughter].  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 We do have a lot of things that, you know, that, you know, the taxes are there
0 nuts.  I came from California and, you know, when I left there, we paid six
0 A:  Right.  I think it's seven here.  
1 B:  Whole state.  
0 A:  Oh, really.  
0 A:  So, you know, even, even in the story where they had to pay the taxes, the
1 A:  Right. 
0 B:  And I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons, but I
1 B:  Schedule A. 
0 A:  I, I saw,  that, too.  
1 A:  Right.  
0 about it, if you pay, I know I get paid twice a month, every two weeks,
0 plus years off of your note.
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  And when we bought this house, we looked at doing a fifteen year note,
0 B:  Is it kind of a buyers market down there?  
0 A:  Credit union has nine percent interest.  
0 B:  So she was at school out here? 
0 B:  What are trying to get?  
0 B:  Good.  
0 A:  They're are going to interrupt us any minute now, I can tell. 
0 B:  Profit. Right.  
1 of that.
0 these different companies that are getting awarded for the ((defense
1 contracts)), that's never going to happen.
0 That's all they have ever done.
0 national level,
1 B:  Unfortunately. 
0 A:  Yes [laughter].  I know many people have said, well, if you throw
1 A:  It, they speak with forked tongue, don't they.  
1 B:  [Laughter].  
0 to.  We're getting so far down to where you're being taxed, so far down where
1 A:  Yes.  That's true.  It doesn't seem to workout that way, though does it
0 my lifetime.  Yes, I think eventually the system will change.  I still think
0 A:  But, I know when I lived down in Houston, on the outskirts of Houston,
1 been, you know, fighting against it, because we, we do not want it.  Well, we
0 know,
1 B:  Oh, that has to be terrible over there.  
0 like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries,
0 A: I mean, between the freeway and the oil refinery, you would see a
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
1 there's signs around saying how dangerous it is and here you are living ...
1 B:  Huh-uh.  [laughter].  
0 A:  Yes.  
0 you know, just astronomical.
0 place that's ever, it's kind of known, that it has, uh, pollution in
1 A:  Huh-uh.  
0 A:  (( )). 
0 A:  That's so awful.  Well, what about in New York.  I guess you've gone that
1 way, maybe.
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  I don't want to go there [laughter].  
0 B:  Have you been there?  
0 B:  Oh.   
0 A:  That's beautiful country up that way.  I know, it's, um, very lush and
1 A:  Well, I'm thirty-one.  
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  No, you're young.  You have a lot of life yet, 
0 passing their emission tests,
0 A:  Oh, you don't.  
0 products and,
1 this.
0 A:  No.  No.  It's scary [laughter].  
1 It's helped me to think more about some issues that I need to be thinking more
1 B:  Yeah.  What do you, where do you like to camp?  How do you like to camp?
0 @A:  Oh, I can camp just about, most anyway [laughter].  Camping or, uh, motor
0 A:  You'd have a lot of hills in that, down in that area.    
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's great.  Long as it's not raining. 
1 B:  Yeah, 
1 B:  You live in Pennsylvania?  [Laughter].  
1 tent camping, and we had access to a motor home which is really super great,
0 B:  -- you know, that have the water piped out --
0 uh, we really enjoyed that.
0 B:  I said I'm losing you, you're getting fad-, you're fading out. 
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 area in there,
0 A:  Well, now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart?  
1 parking lot, we thought, oh, this is great.  And we started taking them up
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 will take almost anything.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Oh, they do, too.  
1 B:  Yeah.  That's true.  And they won't raise our taxes.  
1 B:  ((Yeah)). 
1 A:  Ha-ha  [laughter].  
1 B:  {Speaker is talking to someone in background}.  Sorry.  
1 B:  She'll be two in July.   
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Okay. 
0 head lines, which is normal what you see the night before on the evening news.
0 launched were different and it was almost too much information, over
0 communicated.
0 B:  Yeah, which is a joke.  
0 B:  Yeah.  That's a good point.  Um, but I would have to say across-the-board,
0 I'm satisfied with the way, uh, the news is spread.  Um, of course here at
1 the best resource,
0 B:  of what the layoff status is. 
0 I have to, since I don't have the opportunity in the morning I'll probably
1 A:  Uh, I don't think much of their sports coverage.  
0 A:  But, the, uh, ((T-NEWS)) is a good way to keep up-to-date.  I think they do
0 a pretty good job of selecting the most important items.
0 A:  Huh-uh.  
1 B:  Um, but you need to continue to read, so you people learn to read, you
0 is life, life and limb.  I've seen it happen time and time again.  And, uh,
1 B:  Really I just got mine in the mail so, it kind of sparked me to keep
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Huh-uh.  
1 morning, but not the NINJA TURTLES.  I like the old-timey ones,
0 A:  TOM AND JERRY.  
0 A:  because he's just, he's one of my idles.   
0 B:  with two kids and, you know, I don't want them watching something that I
1 A:  Oh. me.  
0 B:  and then I had, well, you know, I'd eat like at work, we'd have a T V  or
1 recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good
1 [laughter].
1 every once in awhile and I don't recognize anybody, so I guess that's a good
0 sign [laughter].
0 TURNS.  I think AS THE WORLD TURNS may,
1 B:  Right.  
0 like um, my oldest loved SESAME STREET,
0 DISNEY kind, you know, we watch a lot of movies that we've got on V C, on
1 somebody about gun control.
0 B:  I mean, I mean deer hunters do not use automatic weapons.  
0 B:  And this place in Dallas is a mess.  We moved out of Dallas last year.  My
0 doctors one time, and it was located in D C,
0 A:  and he had to park his car.  And his car was like two blocks away from
1 A:  Yeah. That's, that's just ridiculous, you know [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 B:  Oh, yeah. {There is a lot of noise in the background}. 
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B: [Laughter].
1 A:  You know, I mean, it was like, don't you dare stop [laughter].
1 There's a saying down here, all roads lead to south Dallas when you get lost
1 [laughter].
1 the window and he'd watch a policeman chase someone down the sidewalk.
1 B:  Oh, oh.  
0 B:  to go out and get something for protection, because as many break-ins and
0 B:  Do you.  
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Yeah.  Being close, as close as to it, to a situation as he is,
1 B:  and antique weapons.  (( )) he can shoot a muzzle loader real good.
0 that, it bothers, it would make me really nervous to have a gun in the house.
0 it,
0 B:  I know.  I had a college professor that went, I went to school in Missouri,
0 B:  They just wanted money because he was a college professor.  He looked, you
0 gun out, because accidents do happen.
1 gun.  And to this day they declare that the gun was not loaded.
1 A:  And I just cannot get that. Now, obviously, the gun was loaded.
0 B:  Well, 
0 B:  Well, what's their explanation, then.  
1 A:  I'm just like, well, then, where did his stomach go, you know,
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  -- because you get, I get sea sick [laughter].  
1 A:  Oh I see [laughter].
0 house on the coast --
0 do fishing.  I can't remember what the name of the lake is, and he was just
0 here this past weekend.  I could have, I, I think he mentioned it again, but I
0 A:  and I'm not too welcome around, I don't, I really don't want to share a
0 A:  I just, I, I, I don't see it.
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  I'd make some quick arrangements --
0 A:  Oh, on a lake, yeah.
1 B:  yeah, that's a good size fish [laughter].   
1 A:  I would be impressed [laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, yeah.  So, uh, but yeah, I'd love to go ca-, catch like
0 A:  I've, I've seen it, uh, and, and I have no problem going out in a boat, uh,
0 B:  Wow.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 there was so much else to do.
0 B:  down there?   
0 A:  -- it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down, it would be in
0 A:  Small island.  
0 A:  Is it still there?  
0 rest of the time we stayed in the pool, because the water was so awful, 
1 A:  pool.  
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  I've seen what comes out of the ocean, and I have no desire to share,
0 B:  Wow.
0 A:  (( )) the next morning they would have them strung up across the
0 the bottom of the ((getties)) yeah, just,
0 had very many of these calls?
1 hotels with,
0 still call that a camp, so I guess you could go camping and do archery, and
1 conditioned rooms, and I guess of all the, all the ones, I kind of prefer the,
0 at the campgrounds told us that, uh, asked where we were from, and we said
0 rage of water,
1 for you if you like the air condition type.
0 B:  -- still, it's you know, nice to get away from civilization every once in a
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah I end up, well, yeah, I mean, I do a lot of, like even
1 their back,
0 that's civilization --
0 wasn't just the,
0 very first time we went up there with this group of people, we all set up
1 blew down, and,
0 B:  (( )).
0 A:  right in front of that lake, and there's really nothing to stop it, it's,
0 take all our tents out.
1 you know, really so much the, uh, the normal every day,
1 B:  oh this is a nice scene or something like this, it's, it's remember when
1 then too much,
1 B:  I mean, you know, afterwards it's, it's, it's kind of a nice memory to,
0 little rail road ties again, will try to, stop the erosion on the path, and
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  -- thing was one here recently we saw.  At Christmas time, uh, God I
1 haven't been in a movie since [laughter],
0 B:  Maybe, SUPERMAN, BATMAN --
0 B:  -- we saw that one and --
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  We saw that one, uh, we find that, uh, that, uh, if you can get into those
0 pretty good.  They're not, uh, it's not so far, you know, from when they were
0 A:  -- that you don't enjoy them.  Occasionally you'll find one that's, you
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 more interesting to me.
0 B:  Let's see {faint}.
1 uh,
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  -- and it, and then you leave the movie, like, with your brain, you got a
0 A:  -- and usually come out with your back hurting anyway.  
0 A:  Right.  
1 B:  Course, those, those do-, dollar and quarter movies you might catch a
1 A:  Yeah.  That's right.  
0 about, I guess I, we can hang up on this one.
0 B:  Thank you, sir.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  -- amateur team ever.
1 A:  I, I'll bet they could hold their own in the N B A. 
1 A:  I, I bet there's teams they could beat.  
1 A:  Possibly.  
0 B:  Huh.  Made it.  
0 A:  -- they would have to have a really off day and somebody else would have to
0 have a really on day.  And if that, if both of those happened at the same
1 motivation.
1 A:  -- to seventy-three.  Back then they, they called -- 
1 call it the, uh, the U C L A invitational,
1 leave college before they turn seniors.
0 B:  All right, you, too.  Thanks.  
1 A:  -- uh, certainly, you know, there could be advantages and things to be
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 once they got into it then, they, you know, would see that, hey this, this is
0 A:  -- as well.  I mean, they, they might not express it in words --
0 A:  -- so much, but just sort of get in step with, with, uh, what's going on --
0 especially if it's dealing with another person, you know, someone else might
0 somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that --
1 you learn that when someone's relying on you, you need to be there.
1 A:  -- that's tough.
1 B:  I wish I was lucky enough to not want to work [laughter] you know.
0 just as constructive.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 going to jail for,
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  It, it might not make the other person feel like you were really wanting to
1 like that.
0 school and I have a, uh, my oldest son, he's, uh, out seeing the world right
1 A:  Wow.   
0 A:  So you don't get a chance to, to spend much time with him, then, until when
0 part-time job, so by the time that I got home after my second job --
0 B:  Um.   
1 [breathing] and the only time that I got to see them was on weekends and on
0 B:  Yeah, they sure --  
1 A:  And, you know, I, I --  
1 gradually goes away until you have to ask them, do you want to come with me
1 and then they start saying, no, so [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] It can be pretty sudden, too.   
1 B:  Yeah.   
0 A:  -- but I never went, uh, never went camping.   
1 A:  Yeah.  Yeah, up in, uh, New England it's, uh, uh, you know, three or four
1 or five months tops.  After that, you're in the house [laughter],
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  But I wouldn't sleep on the ground.  I went into a hotel [laughter].
0 the head.
1 [laughter] pulled the kid,
1 B:  Oh oh.   
0 A:  -- so I, I [laughter], I didn't realize it until after, uh, you know, after
0 being, like I mentioned, I was in retail when she was younger --
0 A:  -- things like, uh, you know, fishing and, and doing out-, things outside
1 A:  Yeah, well, she was close, but, yet whenever I wanted to do something,
0 and do this or she had, like, little projects she was working on at home and
0 B:  Oh.  
0 B:  Middle child.   
0 and then observing it with my kids at least and then like some other people's
0 children, too, it's, uh, you know, the older kid is, uh, is more, always more
1 B:  -- and that kind of thing.   
0 and, uh,
0 A:  The youngest one is more sensitive?   
1 B:  I don't know if that relates to that or not but,    
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  Yeah, my oldest daughter is hard headed,   
0 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  Right, uh-huh.   
1 B:  -- but, he'd really kind of well up and be ready to cry over there.
0 little bit.
0 back seat on the floor and it was waggling around and we, we came home and he,
1 he wanted to put it in the bathtub so,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter] She told him no he couldn't do it,
1 A:  -- uh, we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool
1 [laughter].
0 did something and I saw the kids out there with sticks digging it up again and
1 I went out there, said, what are you doing.  He said I wanted to show my
1 friend the fish that I caught [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter].   
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And, and the sad part is that people to, to, you know, combat this, they
0 A:  Oh, I know, I know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Get a (( )) crown done --
0 sister [child_yelling] lives over there, and they just, they just never have
1 B:  -- I just don't see how we can,
0 B:  -- But I think we have to be headed --
1 B:  Nice talking to you.
1 A:  Oh, I know, like I said, everyone's been in from Texas.
0 A:  -- and they kind of are in different spectrums, I think.  Um, one of them
1 different, I mean, I don't think they have anything in common,
0 um, it's adventure and things like that --
1 them happen,
1 B:  It's funny that those are my two, my husband's two favorite shows, too,
1 so much and I'm involved with the characters, but,
1 for me.
1 A:  He is [laughter].
0 B:  And I told my husband, that's the whole point, but [laughter] --
0 layer --
1 haven't watched, um --
0 A:  Yeah, I can't remember what her name is, but is,
0 and I think that's what they try to do, but I think we wanted to see Dede
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- you know, if you think about it, they didn't really interact hardly at
0 --
0 --
0 A:  But it's, it's always been a formula, uh, for T V that the minute that two
0 B:  Oh.
0 the subtle little plays on things before they, they, before they get married
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 secret, or at least they keep it quiet.
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- too much lately, but [laughter],
0 A:  No, like Madonna and Sean Penn.  Now I don't particularly like either one
0 way that they could stay together --
1 you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place, so,
0 A:  So, um, well that's kind of interesting.
1 B:  You've had a little bit of variety, huh.
1 A:  Yeah, it's kind of nice [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- but, um, [sniffing] I haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed
0 A:  -- trying to switch, thank goodness for remote control.
0 A:  It was extraordinary, yeah --
0 Reminded me of when I was younger, the, uh, the time of Watergate, and just
0 couldn't get enough of it.
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 the POST?
0 A:  That's, that's maybe because we get so, you know, we're so jaded with the
0 A:  -- which is really international, and, and I keeps reminding me, you know,
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  -- because by ten thirty I start to fade.
0 tells you how old I was, was during the Cuban missile crisis.
0 A:  That's exactly right (( )).
0 A:  That was probably the best part of the news, was the, uh, some of the
0 B:  Yeah, some of it got a little, I, I don't know, I thought it was a little
1 A:  Okay, yeah.  Um, I guess,
0 A:  How old are you?
0 B:  Yeah.
0 I mean, there are so many issues and there're so many people running --
0 B:  And she was in there, she had (( )), and they put her in a nursing home,
0 A:  Yeah, that would seem like that would be more expensive than a, uh, nursing
0 instead of mistreating the people.
0 B:  -- they, yeah that, and they steal,
0 A:  Yeah.
1 bedspread.  I'm talking like it's,
1 A:  In each square [laughter] --
0 B:  almost [laughter] --
0 B:  Yeah --
0 B:  But you don't, it depends on when, didn't you, you have a choice, the only
0 in there and check on them every time but don't tell the people.
0 three o'clock in the afternoon, or one o'clock in the afternoon, and stuff
0 A:  Yeah.
0 place to, some of the people that don't need to be in the nursing home with
0 A:  I'll, I'll say something I said in the last conversation, I hope I'm never
0 B:  You know, they can't really defend themselves like somebody, uh, say my
0 they don't know.
1 kids, so they all, you know paid a month, which was better.  But see, my
0 you, if they're really cooperative,
1 A:  Yeah. 
1 brother, I would be just like, set for life.
1 A:  That's what we keep saying [laughter].
0 B:  You know [laughter].  But not him, he's never happy, and I think that's,
1 way through college, and then, uh, kind of hung them up after college, but,
0 A:  Anyway.  Uh, being in Rochester, you probably like the Mets.
1 hard Mets fan,
0 B:  and an avid Yankee hater.
1 B:  I never fou-, I never quite found a New York fan.
0 A:  I'm from New Jersey originally.
1 know, um, I'm sort of glad Strawberry went away.
1 don't think they're the eighty-six team any more.
0 the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route, um, against Boston --
1 B:  -- when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner (( )).
0 A:  Well, his knees were bothering him, yeah.
0 A:  Oh, boy.
1 A:  -- but there's like two fellows from, uh, Brooklyn,
1 A:  and they, they were, you know, they were pretty much without having to
1 A:  No, not really, they were pretty much thugs, they weren't scared very much,
1 B:  Well, that's good, well, they're Brooklyn boys, I guess.
1 A:  Okay, okay.  Well, I'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs,
1 A:  I love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium.  It's great.
0 A:  The only problem is it's not large enough.  It only holds about, I think
0 B:  Of stadiums, yeah, well, I, I mean to get up there.  I mean, the, the best
0 hours south of, south and east of us.
0 A:  Okay.
0 actually couldn't be a port city.
0 A:  Oh, 
0 A:  Yeah, okay.
0 they're the big team in Rochester.
0 A:  Those games are fun to watch.  You, you, you watch those games?
0 B:  Oh, yeah, I actually, we, we, we make a point of going to a bunch of them
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  But they really seem to, uh, people really get into it.  I mean, I can't,
1 go, uh, they'll go fly.
0 Beaumont Golden Gators who were a double A team for the Padres, I think, but,
1 league games sometimes.
1 B:  Yes, it's true.
0 well, move them up.  Bam (( )).
0 then they just haven't been able to put anything together.
0 the eighty-six team that, that, that they were.
0 up.
1 almo-, almost starting to age a little bit here, I just, um.
1 B:  Yeah, well it takes me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium.
0 got a freeway.  We just get right on the freeway and just go north.
0 A:  Um.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  So, and then, I mean, you go back to New York after school?
0 B:  Some place south, and warm, I don't, I'm not a big, uh, I'm not a big, uh,
1 in the high fifties today, but three and a half weeks ago, we had an ice storm
1 B:  -- so, uh, uh, children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now.
1 A:  -- I mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight
1 get into basketball.  We even have peewee basketball here.
0 A:  So there's always something.
1 B:  Have, have you been out of the country?
0 B:  Oh, okay, well, first, they always say, get to know your country first
0 B: # Oh, okay.  So,# but um, now, I don't know, but um, but let's see, when I was
0 A: # Oh.#
0 B: # That,# that was fun.  That was, and, uh, then after that, I, my sister lives
0 in Turkey, so when I was like fourteen, fifteen, I went, I went to Turkey.
1 B:  But, what happens is we used to fight a lot, so there's never much of a
0 family [laughter] family thing.  You know, one of those hell family vacations.
0 A:  -- because, uh, my dad died, you know, when I was less than a year old --
0 friends --
0 know, his kids are, you know, when his little girl was five years old and
0 B:  -- and, uh, I was brought up the same way, it doesn't matter what age you
0 work from his house.
0 them, and, you know --
0 it's not your kids problems --
0 B:  -- and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you
0 B:  Yeah, my, my father was raising four ki-, oh well, three kids before he had
0 but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, you know, it's like,
0 B:  Yeah, and, and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back
0 B:  -- his life just went down the drain.  So.
0 A:  Well maybe something will open up for you.  
0 A:  It is, this is muggy today like it wants to rain, but it don't know what it
1 A:  Or a not too good summer and a worse winter next year.
0 here really.
0 maybe that'll help to defeat some of the heat --
1 below and you're shoveling snow and it's forty below it's, uh,
1 B:  (( )) any where north of the Red River.
0 B:  That's, uh, I, that's what I've heard people say, is they'll never go north
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 the oil or the gas would turn to slush.  Huh-uh.  See, I can't handle that
1 [laughter].
1 B:  No.
0 B:  -- yeah, it'll change on you.
0 A:  Because yesterday was really nice --
0 B:  Oh, yeah, he's ve-, he, uh, course he, he's dead now.  Seems like most of
0 A:  And, have you been reading him a long time, or,
1 B:  Oh, yes.  Since, well way back in high school.
1 A:  That long [laughter].
1 B:  Well, I, I've been in the military, so I'm well aware of the (( )) palace.
1 A:  Oh, is it [laughter].
0 B:  They've got several out.  Uh, there's one called EMBASSY HOUSE by, uh --
0 A:  I find that one of my interests is, um, I've been, I'm interested more in,
1 A:  But on the other hand, I won't, uh, (( )) Sidney Sheldon's does come off
0 uh, William Johnstone.
0 B:  He writes the (( )) action series.
0 A:  Uh-huh, I've heard, again, I'm not familiar with reading him, but I've
0 B:  Yeah, it's kind of, it follows his, his travels throughout the world.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  They kind of drag on.,
0 A:  It's well written actually.
1 B:  Oh, yes, the man is probably totally insane.
1 A:  That's too bad that's not the topic, I know [laughter].
1 MYSELF.  And I tried to read it, and I went, This is, I did the same thing, I
0 A:  The, um, China, the Red, the, the, I think it was the Red Author, you'll
0 A:  HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, the one I went to see the movie for.
0 B:  Yeah, that was good.  Uh, he's got,
0 B:  -- uh, I think my favorite that he's done is A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.
1 I read about fifty pages, and I just said, I can't take it.
0 somebody.  I don't read as much as I used to, um.  My husband's a T I -er, and
0 B:  -- and then, then MICHAEL, THE SIREN, BLACK HEART, 
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  Does he tell it in narrative form, or in third person.  How does he present
0 B:  Uh, it fluctuates, you kind of get, uh, you get some flashbacks --
0 B:  Yeah,
0 and I like, to me it's like being in a bakery, but then I just don't find
0 A:  Uh, no, that's more, no that's not.  I do, actually I like Asian cultures,
0 A:  That was good, and POLAND --
0 the Spaniards, and it just kind of follows forward.  And I got hooked on it,
1 sixties and early seventies original hippies --
1 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].
0 B:  Um, [breathing] I don't know, I have a, I have a real gut response that
1 A:  And they found her guilty and gave her life with no parole.  And, in a case
0 I'd have to kind of look at.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 prison, or you can institutionalize somebody forever where they're not a
1 B:  Yeah.
0 out of prison after a few years, all of sudden here they're, they're, uh,
0 read the book that Norman Mailer wrote, THE EXECUTIONER'S SONG?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Okay.
0 penalty for somebody who just has no chance of ever reforming or coming to
0 isolation all the time.  I don't believe that they're given a chance to, uh,
0 always registered wherever I've lived, and I have never been called.
0 B:  [Breathing] Part of me says that I'd kind of like to do it, just to see
0 B:  And it'd be the same damn kids --
0 A:  Sure.
0 call it that.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 in a state that absolutely did not allow it --
0 beds.  She puts a lot of time into them.  This is my first year in a, in a
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Jeez, that's --
0 A:  That's a lot [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 the got cross pollinated by the bees --
0 that, I mean, were looked like round big huge round cucumbers.
0 B:  there's even, there's bad chemicals in those too.
0 so I'm not going to, no goi-, I'm just not going to put that tomato plant in
0 A:  But, I, yeah, I do want to have a raised bed.  I've never, my flower
0 A:  So, they're kind of a pain, but, you know, people who don't have them think
1 they're great.  And people who do have them,
0 A:  And I can imagine if I had to mow the lawn in the back, which we said we'd
0 an inch thorns on it.
0 extensively so it gets the trees up overhead,
1 B:  So it'll give you room to get under it, sure,
1 My husband will have problems borrowing one.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah, see I feel like, I don't know, I feel like there's motivation, Bush
0 A:  Yale.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 and up with us on, you know, the mot-, the true motivation.  He talks a lot
0 A:  -- and most Americans probably don't really know what that would mean, and
0 B:  Right.
1 they're so unstable that it makes it hard for, um, it makes it hard for us to
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 know what I saying?
0 World Order.  He talks about it all the time, I mean --
0 B:  Right.
1 about yet, because I haven't heard him in a while, but, I don't know, well
1 bit, but,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  -- all of America would probably go into a coronary and die,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 there's so much going on, but, you know, hey, I'm going to pray about it, and
0 it was like (( )) all the time, and I thought, Gee, you know, God's going to
1 want to watch the war,
1 A:  and so, imagine the sixteen year old, yeah we're having a surprise
1 birthday party and a war started in Israel [laughter].
1 A:  I know, the female version of John Lennon's, but,
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].
0 you know, and they're pretty interesting, but yeah, they're real opinionated,
0 talked about fishing, and I asked him if he took his wife, and he didn't have
1 husband started talking salary.
0 go. I'm going to finish my dishes and if anything [meow] happens interesting
0 again.
0 have, you know, concerns, and --
0 hold them up.  So now, ever since then, when you drive into the city, most
0 tourist area, the river walk area, which is nice, but you don't want to get
0 beach.
0 really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more.  Um, in San Antonio I
0 hopeless tunnels.  I think education helps a little bit there.  Um, then
0 snow.  They have a big brother, big sister program.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  They have bottle drives, they have cleanup outings.  And they have also
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yes.
0 they bring their, their Johns home and they bring their drugs home and the
1 is to that problem, you know.
1 A:  But I like your idea of education [laughter] --
0 hostilities towards them, you know,
0 because that I would be reminded every day --
1 A:  I know it but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city, believe it or
1 not [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh, oh, yeah, but,
0 congregate in Celinas, not so much here in Monterrey.  So, it's, it's pretty
0 A:  -- which in a lot of big cities --
1 A:  Right.  Never been married.
0 A:  I'm only twenty-six.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.  That's,
1 B:  I had already been married and had one child by that time, but, uh, we, uh,
0 benefits is what we like the best, uh, because it's a good (( )) program, it's
0 it only covers fifty percent?
1 A:  Ouch.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh,
0 A:  -- uh, of the, you know, you may not even go in to the doctor for a long
1 B:  Uh-huh.  ((Well if)) we, one of our children is just, just turned two and
1 her first eighteen months of life [laughter] God, well she had one operation,
0 B:  -- up to four percent.  Or maybe it's fifty percent up to eight percent,
1 [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  -- yeah, yeah, yeah that's what it is.  You know about insurance.
0 uh, replacing those whole life policies, which aren't very good insurance
0 happen, you know, at this age, this age, this age, you know --
1 that I know, you know,
1 out here in Phoenix,
1 B:  I've, my husband's company does a little bit of profit sharing, but my
0 and you'll get the little bonus.  That type of thing.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 so.
1 B:  [Laughter] It didn't help any to share.
1 B:  I guess, four years.  Yeah, yeah.  It, uh, quite a different world isn't
0 it [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, I think you're right.
1 B:  Right.  The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
1 A:  Yeah, really, especially in Texas [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter]  Oh, I know it [laughter].  
0 A:  Yeah.  It also seems like maybe a-, another candidate that nobody wants
0 that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you
0 A:  Yeah, people will sit home and assume, oh, that guy would never get
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 this guy's got everything together.  You know, I like what he says, and he'll
0 be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
0 A:  -- I think that discourages a lot of people.  
0 A:  -- I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
1 (( )) all evening [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh,
0 B:  -- because I know, you know, something about the other guy or, you know,
0 and why and everything.
0 think they ever care to.
0 A:  Well, it was good talking to you.
0 we try it every month, and, um, I think it's good, I mean, it gives us a sense
1 B:  No.
1 A:  We, we pay a percentage, um, which is kind of strange, [laughter] --
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 know.
0 A:  -- and he pays a certain percentage of his paycheck.
1 B:  Oh, sure.
1 A:  Do you understand?  [Laughter].
1 B:  Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, that makes perfect sense [laughter].
0 both of us are going to have in a month.  And we take every penny of that and
1 figure it's going to be.
0 A:  Oh, wow, that's really, that is pretty detailed.
1 B:  -- and do all those fun things, and, uh, I think, I think we'd be totally
1 bankrupt [laughter] --
1 what we prove to ourselves every month, is that we're spending more than we
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 possible to live beyond our [/noise] means --
1 better lifestyle later on.
1 A:  Right, well, that's good [laughter].
0 do, also.
1 B:  We're going, we're going through the exact same thing. 
1 B:  Sure.
0 couple of years before --
0 did any kind of budgeting, we, we were in a constant state of saying we can't
1 know, where I've, I've been in a situation where I didn't budget anything,
1 B:  Right.
1 A:  Yes.
1 are grown up and they, they want to do things like go to college --
1 B:  That's right, that's right.
1 A:  So, I hope that, you know, I can continue the college fund, because, it's
1 important that they go to college when they get out of high school [laughter].
1 being totally brilliant, though, though they are --
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  -- but you can't count on them totally brilliant --
1 B:  -- right, right --
1 B:  -- or at least loans --
1 A:  Right [laughter] yeah, 
1 B:  -- that they pay on [laughter].
1 A:  Right, right, [laughter] That's the way you have to do it, right.  No
0 important for me to --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Right.
0 A:  Right.
0 hard way.
0 B:  -- they understand the, our, the, our process.
0 B:  Sure.
0 B:  Right.
0 church was collecting newspapers.
0 hundred miles away --
0 B:  Oh.
1 about no good deed going unpunished,
0 A:  And recycle.
0 A:  I do, too.
1 and, and, uh, the plastics obviously,
0 A:  Yeah, I think I would be like, when I bring my bottles back.  If they're
1 your drink in your hand.  But here, Let me put that in a paper cup for you.
0 B:  [Laughter]
1 A:  What'd you do with them?
1 B:  Put them back [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Uh, no I haven't.  I don't know that I could do that.  That looks awful
1 tiring [laughter].
1 B:  -- no.  
1 B:  I could never get the hang of it.
1 A:  It looks complicated to me.  It's a rhythm or something [laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh.  I usually ended snagging my, uh, fishing partners or [laughter]
1 A:  Catching tree bass, right [laughter].
1 B:  Yes [laughter].  Almost got an owl once.
1 A:  Did you [laughter].
1 A:  Right.
1 B:  Well, I'm a fisher [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] You just like to sit down and watch it, right.
0 B:  Oh, and occasionally we'd go out on a, you know, full day trip, you know,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 really about it.  Mostly just the lakes around here, and I fish to take home
1 and cook [laughter].
1 something home.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 who did not catch,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Really.
1 B:  -- my daughter caught fish, his daughter caught fish,
1 snappers except guess who.
1 B:  That's right, I would go from one side of the boat to the other, and, uh,
1 B:  the, uh, the party boat captain could not understand, you know, he even,
1 even he started baiting my hook [laughter],
1 B:  and holding, holding the, uh, the fishing rod.
1 A:  How funny, just hoping maybe, he could pull [laughter].
0 though is go snorkeling for scallops --
0 B:  And, uh, that I was able to do, when I could go in and go down and actually
1 A:  Hand picked [laughter].
0 archaic.  I, I had no idea what it was.  I called my father long distance just
0 A:  -- it, it was the strangest thing.  Oh, I'll never get over that.  To this
1 day I don't want to get in the water,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh, and this is the ugliest,
1 to get one.
0 A:  I think, uh, the quality of education in the high school system here is
0 noticed that, uh, suburban or rural schools tend to have much fewer problems
0 A:  So the setting is very different than it would be in Dallas or Chicago or
0 all.
0 A:  -- or most of the school problems.
0 school --
0 B:  -- so I think the number one responsibility is on the heads of the parents,
0 taught, and properly, uh, trained.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah.  And here, in Texas, if you don't like football,
0 in the last month.  But we hope that education is first and foremost for the
0 A:  I, uh, [noise] was thinking about salaries and benefits and --
1 um, hours, you know, we, he'd been in graduate school so I was used to his not
1 being home at all [laughter].
0 be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And, uh, I especially liked the prescription, especially since my children
0 phonetically} I think that --
0 B:  Yes.  Yes, it's pretty bad.  Well, yeah, and we, um, we were interested in
0 A:  Right.
1 hour to work or something [laughter].
0 A:  No, we don't like that either [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  That's right.
1 like I say, we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away
1 from us for so long [laughter],
0 A:  Uh, one of the drawbacks, I think, of working for a big company, is often
0 smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say, Hey, you know, this
0 A:  -- [Throat_clearing] smaller companies have bonus plans, where I think in a
0 deal with --
0 A:  -- and you have to have guidelines, you know, for salary increases, and
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 that you would feel happy going to work every day and --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  It's only been, not even a year yet, so.
1 have a lot of thought put into it.  In a big company, though, you also get
1 A:  Or we may be having to drive to Plano, you never know.
1 B:  You never know, we're hoping that that won't be the case [laughter].
0 is that, um, my husband was raised in Irving --
1 car,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, sometimes it can be.
1 @@B:  -- to us.  But anyway.  Well, I, my children just ran out the door, so I
0 B:  Well I've really enjoyed the conversation.
0 A:  Uh, I don't know, there's a lot of air pollution.
0 can be, but, uh, that stuff going on over there.  What, what, uh, what part of
0 cars every day, just in, uh, just in a little different# grade, I guess.#
0 car, and you see an awful lot of, uh, one person vehicles on the road on,
1 any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air.
0 A:  Yeah.  Um.  We have a couple, we have like a steel mill and a couple
0 A:  -- but the fine is nothing, you know,
0 B:  That's true, that's true.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 in the air during planting seasons and what not, but that, that was all we
0 ever saw, and then five years ago I moved to Dallas, and I suddenly started to
1 downtown, uh, you can be on the road and still not see it.
1 A:  Oh, my God [laughter].
0 B:  -- let the, you know, let the natural, natural systems take care of the
0 doing, doing some damage --
1 B:  But, uh,
0 where a couple of the mills that have, I know they put things on their stacks,
0 B:  All righty.
0 is, is too stringent?
1 society.  So you kill him, period, end of story.
0 A:  Yeah and ours,
0 they've swung so far away from --
0 in an eye for an eye.  And I think probably, uh, uh, maybe the majority of the
0 people do.  At least the people that, uh, that I talk to.  You go out there
0 and you kill somebody, you rob a gas station or a drug store and you shoot
0 B:  But that's what's got our system bogged down so bad now.  They've appealed
0 A:  Yeah.
0 Why can't they do something about it?  Because they can't, if they, if they
0 right?
0 B:  Overcrowding, overcrowding.
0 A:  That's incredible.
1 A:  Yeah, well, I don't know.  So you going to make a career out of it?
1 B:  I seriously doubt it [laughter].
1 B:  -- kind of been close to that.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- their own lives and things, and usually working and -- 
0 B:  -- there's a,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- yeah.
0 B:  So it's kind of a, that's a hard one, but it is a very nice nursing home.
0 something like that, you know,
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 A:  Uh-huh --
0 A:  -- the very same, yeah.
0 B:  That's right.
0 B:  Well, yeah, I've talked to my mother about that several times lately, and
0 A:  Yes.
1 A:  And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either --
1 B:  [Laughter] Yeah.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 almost every day --
1 out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, oh, gosh, you can ride a
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But Washington's a great place to do that.
0 A:  And so, but that somehow takes,
1 A:  No, I live in Maryland.
0 A:  Uh, the neighborhood, also.  I mean, we're within walking distance of, of
0 B:  Well, it's, uh, it's really both.  I'm certainly driven by the desire to
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 facilities for swimming in winter, but, um, and, and that's true, when I go
0 going to drive the T I people crazy.
0 B:  Oh, okay, because I grew up in North Hollywood, California --
0 uh, tow it behind my motor home --
1 day was through.
1 B:  -- I mean, I had to loosen the front bumper --
1 B:  Huh-uh.
1 A:  -- and didn't think anything about doing my own repair work, and I, about
0 front wheel off, and he says, Uh, I think I've got the problem.  I says,
1 what's that.  He says, Your brakes are no good.  So he says, Want me to pull
1 the back off?  I says, No.  And so [laughter] he pulled them off anyway
0 [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh, let's see, where was I.  I was over in Mississippi --
0 B:  -- and, uh, driving, at that time I had this little Ford Escort, which tows
0 A:  It was a continuous squeal?
0 B:  -- rather than the other.
0 A:  What, uh, uh, this is, evidently it's a new technology that, uh, that came
0 beginning.
0 A:  After he pulled all my for wheels off, he says, you're going to need new
1 oversize, and you need new this, and you need new that, and he come up with a
1 bill of seven hundred and forty-eight dollars.  I've got a [laughter],
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 six hundred, almost seven hundred dollars --
1 B:  Oh, boy.
0 take it right down there and tell the guy to put it in.  So, I, uh, I went
0 unusual, because I --
0 A:  -- looks like, uh, all tubes and wires and vacuums and --
0 worth of labor,
1 B:  I'm afraid so, the car in the garage.
1 and put some presentations down there, and every time I open my mouth
0 A:  Attleboro, Massachusetts.
1 {imitating Southern speech} that Southern accent once in a while.
0 your way too.
1 B:  Oh, yeah, think, uh, probably, I guess it's pretty well wide spread nation
0 estate, and of course when oi-, when oil went south, real estate went with it.
0 major culprit.
0 B:  Right.
0 they're over reacting as far as the actions taken against their, the little
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
1 band aid on the problem last week, or something.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 financial institution is a house of cards, waiting to collapse.
1 nine years I've heard that, that we would grow our way out of, uh,
1 it's, what it's going to take to turn that around.
0 B:  That's a good point, they, uh, [laughter] they got a little hesitation in
0 A:  Definitely.
0 three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds, or something like that.
0 A:  -- but there's still a lot more we can do.
0 The problem is, with a lot of it is, you have to go, you know, it takes a
0 A:  Yeah see, and,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah, I don't, yeah, I don't think it would crush steel cans, it's pretty
0 B:  And I've bought, you know, I've bought greeting cards that are made out of
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  But, I think we're doing better and better all the time,
1 out on barges somewhere.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they'll get at it sooner.  I guess the schools will get
1 B:  I'm pretty lazy about it right now.  Everything goes into one thing and
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  That's right.
1 B:  No, I, I make so much money here at T I that, that we just spend it.
0 semi-conductor firm, you can just spend it well.
0 and two hundred for that because we had a child which is about a year old, and
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 looking at this from the other aspect of,
0 A:  -- trying to pay those off.  And we have one car payment that we don't, I
0 A:  And after that, we either, what we want to do is begin doubling up our car
0 B:  -- the finance charge, which is kind of, you know, it's like one of these
0 the world, but.
0 A:  Oh, really.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  T I -er to,
0 when he started working at T I, we, uh, you know, we really felt like God told
1 cut and stuff, both of us.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Oh, really.
0 A:  But, anyway, instead of putting our foot down about it, we just went, okay,
0 save a lot in interest, just doing that.
0 B:  And you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan, if
0 you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house 
0 B:  -- it'll make, uh, it has a magic with numbers.  It, I, it'll shave almost,
0 this town.  It's, it's, uh, it's really a sin, it really is.
0 A:  Oh, my.
1 found they locally serviced it.  And we just stopped payment on the check.  So
0 B:  Oh, okay, well --
0 B:  But I've, I've gotten rid of all of the credit cards, you know, that I
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Absolutely.
0 that, but, you know, a lot of folks do.
0 to, you know, to replace checks and every other thing.
0 A:  No.
1 them.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 them out.  I mean, that's funny.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 credit cards, you know, as time goes by.  Unless you just absolutely have to.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  We, we plan purchases, you know, pretty well, you know, watch for the best
0 A:  [Click] Oh, I've got another call.
0 B:  Well, I think, I think basically [talking] we're [talking] in a lot of
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Really.
1 and he had his pockets full of stuff, you know, when he was caught --
0 A:  Right.
1 we don't need to do that.
0 B:  -- they have on T V --
1 B:  If we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the,
0 whole Biblical concept like that, [noise] {sounds like telephone} that's true
0 in a lot of our, [breathing] um, you know, the, the way the whole judicial
1 loving Lord in the New Testament.  But that's a whole different subject.
1 A:  Yeah, well, I'm from the Dallas area.
0 A:  Oh, I think so, too.  And I think the other thing is the news me-, media
0 A:  Due to the overabundance of news we have available to us.
0 don't have, um, that, that it doesn't matter as much, whereas I think it's
0 people could have more effect on a local level.
0 someone saying are you going to vote today, they say, Well, I would --
0 A:  I had an interesting comment one time, a thought that would never have
1 crossed my mind.  I had someone tell me that, I will never register to vote
1 B:  Um?  What do they have to do with one another?
0 A:  [Laughter] I just, I, they, I just wandered off from that one.  I was just
0 B:  Oh, so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever.
1 B:  Yeah, there is.  There are much easier ways to get out of jury duty.
0 B:  Just go in and say, Oh, I want to be a juror, I can spot a guilty person a
0 in lines to vote.
1 B:  Yes, they were, they were doing that.  Unfortunately, what, what, they,
1 they had no idea what they were voting on [laughter] it turns out.
0 people sort of, only half of them will end up voting, and sort of caring
0 an underdog candidate who represents something, and even if he doesn't win, a
0 A:  Even if they lose.
0 B:  Um.
1 Richards.
1 did, and she did it backwards in high heels.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  -- because it's, it's difficult.  
1 A:  It's situational, really.
0 B:  So, how do you think we can get people to vote?  [laughter].
1 A:  -- a dollar bill comes out the bottom.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  We got, we got what some people call the best beef in the world.
0 buy all these parts of the cow, and then you just cook them over a grill.
0 A:  Oh, I love those, uh-huh.
0 B:  And, then we also put sausages on a bun, and then that's, that's to start
0 A:  It used to be in Georgetown, years ago.  He moved, I guess he, he retired
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 twelve, nineteen thirteen.
0 mean, that sometimes --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Okay.
0 for just, just two, say two minutes, check it after two minutes to see if the
0 B:  Okay, because I got, I got, um, one of those little, uh, microwaves, the
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  H O I ,
0 B:  S I N,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  -- to thin it, and stir that in.  You can even put a spoon of ketchup in,
0 A:  For two people, um, Amer-, if it's American style, I buy a half a pound.
0 dish with it, say the rice dish --
1 a pound and then, you know, you could,
0 A:  Just stir fry the ground beef.  Drain off the oil.  Use the same hoi sin
1 don't know what advice I'd give them.  Go to the school you'd like to go to.
1 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.  
0 B:  North Carolina.
0 B:  Yeah, right.
0 A:  And, uh, it's a lot cheaper.
0 private institution for the first two years.
0 Um, and from that point I went to law school.
1 B:  And after a year and a half of that I decided I didn't want that either
1 [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, good grief.
1 public school teacher is entirely another thing.
1 B:  I am a dis-, I am, I am just a disgruntled person all around [laughter].
1 into different fields, I made an off, off the cuff remark about lawyers,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  about their integrity being questionable.  And I mean, oh, that was like
0 [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  -- and I guess, I, I, guess Iraqi now is the [laughter].
0 have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I mean, I wasted a year and a half of awfully hard, and I aged ten years.
0 B:  What branch were you in?
1 A:  I didn't make it, I sort of washed out.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I, I, I, I think, I think there's a lot to be said for kids working --
1 A:  But, um, I like that because it, it really makes me laugh.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  And she couldn't get out, and her hair, it was, and she was heavy --
1 A:  Oh, it was hysterical, and just real funny things, you know,
0 A:  people skiing and doing funny things on --
1 A:  I often think, Gee, I wish I had a video camera, because I could sure use
1 [laughter] ten thousand dollars.
0 A:  And, uh,
1 Star Spangled Banner,
1 it every evening when I come home.
1 A:  And her and Frank and the baby.  
1 here, I called the station and complained.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  And I watch all the football games.  Monday night, Thursday night, and
0 A:  Yeah, but my mother does not miss a game, and you just don't know.  She
0 A:  I just don't do it.  You know, she might call me during a halftime, or
0 after the game or something, but I just don't call her.  And now, they're
1 B:  And, uh, basketball seems like all that you can really see is run and
1 shoot, run and shoot, run and shoot  [laughter].
1 A:  Well, we kind of do, but ours,
0 A:  And, we've had our air conditioners on already.  It has been hot and humid
0 B:  But, uh, they'll be back up there.
1 A:  Yeah, people say they wish they had a roof on it though.  
0 A:  But, it,
0 A:  -- because there are some fans there.
0 Come on up.  So we would hop in the car --
1 A:  Well, that must be,
0 program to evaluate schools and to, uh, try to resolve problems within
0 A:  -- education teacher.
0 B:  Okay.
1 A:  And it had, uh, had st-, standard on, you know, standard --
0 B:  Oh [laughter].
1 A:  -- and I had never had a standard car before.
0 cold weather.  We had a little bit of snow here and there, but I mean, I
0 A:  Oh well, today it was probably in the eighties.  Um.
1 B:  Oh, is that right?
0 B:  -- we had hit the, actually, uh, nineties for about four days, which is
0 A:  Right.
1 cherry blossoms blooming, so,
0 A:  Well that's, that's sort of what happens here, except, uh, we may start a
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  But I always wondered about the south.  I figured there couldn't be too
0 farther east you go --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And, you know, the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties,
1 B:  I see.
1 A:  When it got down in the sixties you were cold down there [laughter].
1 was shocked to see people all bundled up,
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  -- in the twenties, because here in the fifties people have sweaters.  So,
1 A:  Oh, yes, it's a big difference.
0 shirts.  He will not wear, you know, jackets and things like that.
0 formerly a Pennsylvanian, and I have to say that I enjoy it much better here.
0 there's not a lot of trees.
0 B:  Oh, right.
0 A:  Well, now, that's, that's not necessarily true. 
0 A:  -- around trees.  I thought that was hilarious --
1 that,
1 her, except she's very, very old, but her personality is, is very grating.
0 [laughter] I mean, I hope I don't get like that when I get old.  So.
0 the people out of them because they were so, uh, bug infested and
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 her some place else, the people might not be so nice.  So, the, the
0 institution.
0 and they, they couldn't handle her.  So they put her in a home, and then, uh,
0 the old Frenchman, he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids, Oh, you
0 home just for the fact I don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing
0 he's going to probably, hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay
1 tows cars.  [laughter]
1 work.
0 A:  So someone like that, they, I really don't want to see them go in a home.
0 B:  I know.
0 A:  I mean, when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have,
1 become a burden to the family.  You know, Just put me out to pasture, or shoot
1 me, or something, you know.  [laughter]
0 B:  T V shows.
0 A:  Yeah.  Do, would you prefer all trials by a judge?
0 not the award of, of penalties and fines and punishment.
0 B:  Uh-huh, that's true.  But, uh, I do like the idea of the jury being the,
0 other.
0 B:  Exactly, but they took, you know, whatever the majority was.  So I didn't
0 A:  I know they can poll a jury, make sure everybody agrees with what they said
0 A:  Yeah,
0 A:  -- for something like that because of the cultural differences.
0 just at its minimum, things of that nature.  But,
0 A:  Yeah, I,
0 B:  And I guess you're eligible after twenty-seven for parole, even though
0 B:  Exactly.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Jim.  Sorry about that.  Do you have any pets?
0 store, and the, uh, a Filipino lady that ran the store was giving them away,
0 and we took him home with us when he was about three weeks old, and, uh,
0 home by air, and you know, you have to really love a pet to spend two hundred
0 uh, by air, and, uh, let my family know when he was going to be in, and they
1 him.
0 A:  And it's amazing how they, how they adapt to the outside.  I was raised in
1 grandfather stories,
1 bloody thing would sit outside my window and bay at the moon at night
1 [laughter].
1 particularly during the full moon,
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 wouldn't get ripped off by a Malay.  Uh, the other fifty percent was pa-, some
1 dogs.
1 A:  Except the only problem is, we played badminton in the yard a lot,
1 yard at night before we went to play badminton [laughter].
1 particularly in the tropical climates where we were.  And when she came back
1 automobile.
1 of it.  Because, you know, here are these two guys, you know, walked in with
1 B:  You know, with a dog,
1 B:  bringing a dog on the job,
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 fantastic.
1 our cat's food dish is, and he likes our food a lot better than he likes hers,
1 right off and put him back out again.
0 out there at the door, and as soon as I open it to go out, he's by me like a
1 shot,
1 A:  he likes our food best.
0 A:  So, I can wear jeans and, um, pretty much a sweater or even a T shirt to
0 B:  Gee.  That's great.
0 B:  Oh [sniffing].
0 A:  -- and it's like, I go right over to my [laughter] sister's house.  What do
1 B:  and I don't even care how I look.  I mean, I, I'll have a turtle neck
0 A:  #Boots.#
0 A:  Yeah.
0 --
0 sometimes I'll just have to wear like leggings until I get to work --
0 A:  have to wear polyester smocks.
0 polyester, uh, smock and you just get so hot -- 
1 A:  So you really, in the summer time have to, we have to dress extra light
1 B:  Yeah, I know.
0 A:  But they still, they have to keep the pants really just,
0 B:  Well, that's true.  
1 A:  I would be one of the women in flats [laughter].
0 going to spend a lot of time working, and now it's very slow, and I pretty
0 B:  Uh-huh.  That's great.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  NIGHT COURT?
0 thirty minutes or an hour to watch some T V shows, it's a little different
1 A:  -- drags on forever.
0 A:  Yeah, something to remove, you know, something to remove me from reality --
1 A:  Cause I, I mean, I don't know, it's just something, I think, something we
0 next day they'll show it on another one.
0 B:  Well, yeah, and what I like about that show is that the time, the time
1 A:  -- never saw that,
0 first came up here, so I, you know, there's a gap in my T V viewing, but
0 B:  Back to back.  When I was in college, you know, we didn't have T V -s, and
0 big deal, and everybody'd get together like one night a week to watch T V,
1 but, I hate that (( )) you have to give up a lot of T V when you have
1 [laughter], 
0 B:  What about the, do you like L A LAW, or,
1 SOMETHING --
0 B:  About ten years [laughter].
1 two drama shows that I like.  And I tell everybody, don't call me (( ))
1 B:  But other than that, you know I like, I, um, I'm recovering from surgery,
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  So I get to see about everything [laughter].
0 couple of shows of, uh, what is it, a COP ROCKS, or something like that,
0 B:  You're kidding,
1 A:  No.
1 A:  I can see why it crashed,
1 B:  I don't think it was supposed to be funny though [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  All right.  
1 alike, uh, you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to
0 sort them out, uh, and it, uh, [laughter] it caused more confusion about it.
0 came along and offered a free one, uh, I accepted that, and we've been using
1 parent becomes the one that's responsible, but it's,
0 if he got off --
0 thirty thousand dollars of, uh, well, it was a combination of things --
0 B:  Yeah.  I saw that.
0 B:  Yeah, and, and it's, so it's business, so, and you notice that they're,
0 A:  Yes.
0 B:  I mean a mortgage I know you can,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 ways to work, and he's got just enormous debts, and he's, but, I mean, what do
0 that debt.  Well, he's had, had two kids in college and, and this kind of
0 A:  Miscellaneous things like food and --
0 B:  Yeah, so.
0 B:  -- and now I'm out here in Phoenix.
0 B:  -- that was interesting, cause I always, you know, you --
0 B:  Yeah, I've heard about them.
0 B:  That's mostly locally, the banks will line up with, uh.
0 do that because of the, the time frame which they get paid, in general, that,
0 B:   Uh, not if it's done fairly.  And that's probably my question
0 B:   Well, they might tell you it's random.  
0 A:   Yeah.  
0 B:   You know.   
0 drug test at a certain point prior to the season -- 
0 B:   Right.  
1 A:   -- and their manager assumes they have a drug problem -- 
0 B:   Right, right.  Yeah, it, it would almost be like a, a, 
0 some reason, I've come up three times.  That's pretty high
0 now, but for the prior job, uh, but I know that they sent, that the
0 the company you worked for bef-, before have the right or do they
0 have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her and she
0 A:   Well, no, I don't think they can, they can force another
0 B:   Oh, okay.  I see.  
0 A:  Oh, that's not bad.
0 B:  [Lipsmack] Yeah, it wasn't that bad.  And, uh, but they are big and they're
0 afford a new car they're so expensive.
1 eventually had his own private junkyard, which is terrible to look at,
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 l-, like the Dallas Police Department has a car auction every Monday morning
0 A:  Yeah, I've heard that, that's a really good way to get cars.  Up here they
0 but, but they don't, uh, they don't [lipsmack] repossess that many cars up
0 here, k-, figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of, uh, where
0 they repo-, they, uh, take their cars for illegal activities --
0 million and a half people, or something.
1 cars, but then, of course, there is more people interested in them, too.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  -- five thousand dollars buys a lot of tires.
0 A:  -- wire and cable burned. 
0 A:  -- I mean, it had a full size door handle on it and it
0 are, they're very popular and I guess they run, they, they, you, they just
1 A:  Well, I, I have problems with my car.  I'm not saying, it's not perfect or
0 B:  How did you like your Volvo?  
1 roads and I was ruining the car, so I sold it,
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  -- I could beat around.  
0 getting cars.  It's, it's refusing them because, uh, people always come to my
1 father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them because they know
1 B:  That's, that's a pretty good deal. 
0 colleges that I'm sure are struggling but, uh, it's the job that the, the
0 had a child.  I wouldn't let them go to a public school system there.  But, of
0 live in a big Metroplex and some of the, the better parts of the Metroplex,
0 not going to use them.  And through high school I could have gone so much
0 B:  Right, in high school.  
0 not enough teachers and too many of the kids don't care.
0 B:  #So,# 
0 B:  Right.  
1 B:  You hope.  
1 she's twenty-one years old and she's got four kids.  A kid in, her first
0 B:  -- what, what do you advocate, more taxes or better management of what they
0 are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been
1 getting cut back, and you're getting --
0 A:  So,
1 bad school.  Who knows, bu-, maybe we do, we need some more Catholic schools,
0 in the past.  In, uh, some places, uh, you couldn't go to a public school.  It
1 all the time.
0 engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of M I T.  And
0 A:  Well,
1 B:  Okay [laughter].  
1 not been doing as much as I did, you know, before I had to work for real
1 B:  That's like a hobby, because I don't ever make anybody nothing but me
0 B:  Or maybe little kids.  I've, I've done weddings, but -- 
0 B:  -- it calms me down.  
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  And then it lies in a drawer for about five or six years, at least.
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  But I love it [laughter].  
1 B:  And I always tell people, if you ever go up in one, you just, that's it,
1 B:  But, other than that, that's the only fall back, you know.  Because the
0 A:  Yeah -- 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 mean, you know, Rockwell, they don't have one, Rockwell, whatever it is.
0 just put the name of the bank or whoever is sponsoring that ball-, --
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  -- it looked like you could just dive off and, and,
0 A:  THE WATCHERS, you know, they made a movie of THE WATCHERS, here not too
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  And I had the book and I hadn't read it in so long so I read it the other
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, usually the -- 
0 one Judith Krantz made, that was [lipsmack], they did that one really, they
0 did okay, but I liked the book better.
0 A:  Yeah, the book was a lot better, I thought.  
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  I can't do that.  
0 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  I've always tried to do that.  
1 in a couple of weeks.  Ha [laughter].
1 A:  You know, it's so much fun you don't really think about it.  And
0 B:  Yeah.  I like aerobics.  
0 A:  -- Dallas.  So, so you go to the fitness center.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Well, yeah, that's the same kind of thing like belly dancing, you know, you
1 A:  It's sort of cute, too.  
0 B:  Yeah, I like Jazzercize [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, well, see I belong to the fitness center so I feel like I have to go
0 to the aerobics class to get my money's worth, you know [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, well, it's so neat because it's right there and I can go just right
0 A:  Yeah, that's handy and they're just there, you know, when you want to use
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  
1 like, he wants to, he says I'm going to pump up.  I said uh-huh.
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  Body build, huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  But I always ask him how come they don't ever have no hair.  Because
1 B:  I told him, I said, well, if you do it, you can't shave your hair.
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 or women to death before, I mean.
1 president because I would, you know, I knew we had to go to war and I --
0 A:  -- for people getting hurt if, you know, if, I don't know.  
0 trapped.
0 a tendency to -gree, agree, I mean, it's a deterrent, it's, it's the ones like
0 A:  Where you work?  
0 He, he acted like he didn't even think that this was going to kill her.  The
0 running.  I mean, if this happened in the city, the, I'm sure the youth would
0 A:  Yes, it's, it's really sad.  
0 like little slaves, they holler at --
0 B:  Yeah, the, uh, the, we were shocked two mornings ago with, uh, the news
1 A:  Oh, g-.  
0 A:  Well, then they wouldn't do this for the drug kingpin that they were going
0 for the drug kingpins.  I don't,
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  They're not my favorite team.  
1 A:  And, uh, uh, what do you think Milwaukee's going to do this year?
0 them, but, uh, I think this is going to be a year for pulling together --
0 B:  Well, there's been some talk that they're going to trade Pete Incaviglia.
1 truth to that, but you never can tell.
0 up their pitching staff.  Uh,
1 A:  Right.  
1 I'm real nice to him he's going, 
1 progress and, uh, get him on board.
1 B:  Right, somewhere else.  
0 B:  Canseco's making five million a year.  
1 A:  Right.  
0 know, help support and funnel the funds into, uh, to make it happen, whatever
0 B:  Yeah, I'll watch quite a few games on T V.  
1 out, they fizzle.
0 B:  That seems typical because most of their other stars, uh, Paul Molitor's
1 A:  Right.  
1 uh, we'll just have to watch and see how it goes, comes about.
0 A:  We'll talk to you later.  
0 regular bills.  You know, your credit cards and your, uh --
0 A:  Huh.  
0 lot of them's got alimony and child support and all that.
0 A:  Yeah, but, you know, you know, bills wise, uh, we kind of divide everything
0 over, like, seventy-five or eighty dollars, then we, uh, we talk about it.
0 B:  And, you know, how they got the Tex-, uh --
1 bounce, but it came close.  We called our landlord and asked her to hold off
0 for it because we got to pay them by April.
0 A:  Yeah, they want their money real quick.  
0 B:  Yeah, I just k-, I just think that I, it would help a lot if I got a job,
0 A:  Well, Bonny, it sounds like a pretty good idea.  
0 A:  Tell you what, uh, I think we about done our about five minutes.
0 B:  All right, bye-bye.  
0 B:  You know.  It's like you're not going to go in there and say no, listen,
0 people, you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there, but
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- why not.  
0 know, three hours of when the weapon was shot.
0 which they eventually will, he's got one less thing to go against him.
0 you give up, then you can come live in our country and we'll take care of you,
1 A:  Right, I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet.  
1 B:  Uh [laughter], no.  
0 that's ridiculous.  You know, I mean, I just don't believe it.  I think there
0 are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't, but it's pretty
0 beginning --
0 getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on
0 A:  Right.  
0 A:  Okay, well thanks.  
0 A:  Bye-bye.  
0 national consciousness to do it.  We've always measured things in the English
0 A:  Right.  
0 A:  Yeah, I, I agree with you.  I don't think we should either even though I
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  And they do, I know now because I, even when I was in elementary school
1 really getting and --
0 A:  -- do all this.  It's like, I mean come on let's take the pressure,
1 B:  You know you need twenty gallons, but do you need how many liters
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  And it, it just doesn't, (( )) it just doesn't make that much difference in
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Uh-huh.  That's,
1 B:  It may be arrogant, but I mean, let them come to us [laughter].  
1 B:  Yeah.  And, and, instead of ((saying)) the world speak German we found out
1 A:  That's funny.  Well, that's good.  I think we kept it at real good.
0 B:  [Laughter] Okay.
0 A:  And we'll end up, one man was telling me about his grandfather in
1 A:  I know.
0 B:  Oh, boy.  Well, mine was two in March and the three and a half year old
1 A:  That's pretty close.
0 B:  The baby was eleven weeks old #and his brother was# --
0 year olds in a room and I just think it was way too much.  #The were almost
0 three #years old# --
1 A:  #Jeez.#
1 B:  -- I don't find that to be a behavioral problem #[laughter].#
1 A:  #I don't either [laughter].#  So.
0 going on that she felt like she needed to control more --
0 different classrooms.  #And I# --
0 A:  Yes.
0 B:  -- kind of thing.
0 as my little boy and I though, well, you know, we'll try her.  But she came to
1 A:  Uh, I mean, she loved the kids and she was good with them.  But, uh, you
0 was like, you know, the kitchen table, the, I'd find peanut butter and jelly
1 A:  #Well, you know, I work# eight to five thirty so what am I supposed to do
0 Monday because I was sick.  So I stayed home with them and we went to some of
0 A:  Well, that's what they said.  There were two pretty near our house and they
1 #[laughter],#
0 A:  #They,# 
0 B:  -- one bad, I had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that
1 A:  Oh, that's horrible.
1 A:  Well, not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars
0 flowers, #you know, and# --
0 A:  -- #things like that.#
0 going.  You can bring your kids Monday [lipsmack].
1 A:  up for me.
1 understand what I s-, #[laughter].#
0 A:  #And the hours are wonderful# and I just, I think it's the best thing.  I
1 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- come home with it, you know. and, uh,
1 B:  -- with the two of them because the baby is so into everything and the
0 older brother is [laughter] you know, running around all over the place so --
0 A:  I know --
0 A:  -- #peace of mind also.#
1 B:  -- to have something like that, so I, I think I'm going to look for that.
1 Remind me of that now that you mention it #[laughter].#
0 B:  Yeah [thumping].
0 A:  -- #it was good talking# to you.
0 B:  Uh, Mazda.  
0 because everybody I know has got a American made truck.  They just seemed to
0 clearance.  We got some property and I need to get out in the pasture a lot.
0 sixteen to eighteen in town and twenty to twenty-two on the road.
0 clipping along at sixty-five or so around there when he can get away with it.
0 B:  Right.  
0 the roof down.
0 B:  Yeah, it's like I got -- 
0 A:  -- probably, probably eight hundred by now.  
0 A:  They don't give those, they don't give those B M W -s away.  Those are
0 B:  #Bye.# 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 Maryland, uh, I just bought a, uh, a house for a hundred and forty-one
1 thousand.  It would be about sixty thousand down there [laughter],
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 think they only have the house valued at probably about [throat_clearing]
1 B:  So they were shooting themselves in the foot,
0 income tax purposes.
0 B:  Uh, yes I did.  I only lived in Texas in eighty-seven and, uh, eighty-eight
0 tax or even, uh, maybe we should put more emphasis on sales tax because when
0 children you have, the less tax you pay and to me that is completely crazy.
1 And I have five children so,
1 thought about that, how you, you, you know, that, that's right, I guess
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 pretty hard nosed.  And, uh, he's, you know, we're three hundred fifty million
1 B:  -- and he's, like, what do you guys want me to do.  
1 A:  [Laughter].   
0 benefit, dollar benefits out of it that, uh, to reduce spending in some other
0 all that.  You're paying people not to work and you're paying people to have
0 A:  -- things go into it so, but, uh, some kind of a national service, uh,
0 concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a, I think would be
0 the money stops and disappears along the way.
0 understand why the American leaders, uh, seem to think that that's the way to
0 A:  Or making the American system work in the way it's originally designed to.
1 A:  -- uh, while he's trying to, uh, find a nice girl and get married
1 B:  That's a hard process, isn't it [laughter].  
0 A:  -- uh, an October baby --  
1 it on the fifteenth.  So we'll see [laughter].
1 that one day,
0 was, was alcoholic.
0 A:  Um.  
0 feel that way, but that's just part of our priorities.
1 A:  Christianity doesn't hurt us any does it?  
1 B:  That's right [laughter].  
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  But, if he forgets, I try to, to help to him -- 
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  I think so.  
1 B:  -- and, uh, as far as me personally, I think it made me appreciate my
0 husband more because he doesn't do [laughter] certain things --
0 control.
0 that.
1 of decisions on her own yet.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 than he did to us.
0 A:  Oh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  That's right, yeah.  Yeah.  
0 A:  -- I'm sure they felt they had no choice.  At our stage in life we've seen
0 a lot of our friends go through divorces, uh, you know, we've been married
0 marriage and they've got his kids and her kids and I think, my gosh, all the
1 A:  Uh, I've only purchased one new car in my entire life.  
1 A:  Right.  And that was back in nineteen fifty-nine.  
0 A:  And it was a new Ford.  So, the automobiles that, that I have --
0 B:  Oh, really.  
1 B:  Well, that's great.  
0 A:  So, yeah, it's going to be, uh, let's see, next year I guess it will be an
1 antique.
0 B:  Course [laughter],
0 A:  Uh, every once in a while, though, uh, I'll read a blip where you guys get
1 A:  But they don't put salt on the roads down there, then?  
1 B:  [Laughter] They sand the roads and it just turns into a big mess
1 A:  Nobody, nobody goes anywhere, no one,
1 to get rid of this thing because there's no way we can haul kids and junk and
0 gallon, uh.
0 some of the smaller ones, you know, that, they get a zillion miles.
0 A:  You, what, what do you look for.  Uh, ease of handling or roominess.
0 A:  -- uh, wood stove  -- 
1 A:  -- for the work I was doing around.  But now everything's done so,
0 B:  Oh, yeah.  
1 A:  -- when I left here and we're down to the thirties and twenties and,
0 you, you just can't sell a car down here that does not have air-conditioning
0 in it.
1 not have air-conditioning and we went through one summer that way and that was
0 B:  Yes.  
0 thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on, that's a, that's a big
0 every year down there.
1 have a fire tax that they add on, too.
1 Sounds like you got a, a little one there.
0 B:  Oh, she hit her, she hit her head [laughter].  
1 A:  Oh. 
0 B:  Right.  Homes, vehicles, you know, everything.  Everything like that gets,
0 A:  Still have to pay it, yeah.  
1 sixty-seven Pontiac, it's got a hundred fifty-eight thousand miles on it --
0 A:  -- then you're buying somebody's headaches probably.  
0 A:  I think that's true.  The, uh, the Bermuda grass is greening up in March,
1 grass coming up, and I thought, ooh, we've got to start this mowing bit soon
0 you know, just,
1 B:  Yeah.  But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray
0 B:  Yes, as a matter of fact, I heard the weather the other day on T V and I
0 last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm.
0 B:  Oh, wow.
0 A:  I, you know, I was going into the grocery store, and a, a lightening bolt
1 A:  Nope.
1 A:  Not too challenging to the brain.
0 B:  -- but unfortunately the house is taking up my time.  
1 were kind of, little upset.
0 B:  -- and, uh, I think that's probably going to be one of the next
0 A:  -- you know, I get a little exercise there, too, so.
0 alone for a while, and then finally got, got into it when I was, while I was
0 A:  Yeah.
0 few years.
1 A:  And then I got into it and then back out of it, and it just seems like
0 B:  That's right, yeah.
0 A:  Sure, come on out, you know, and they don't mind if you make a mistake,
0 A:  -- and you can't find that in all sports.
0 A:  And it's something we can do together, so.  Well, she doesn't do much
0 Dallas to, to go pheasant hunting, and, uh --
1 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- I'd get upset about it sometimes, and now I guess, you know, being in my
0 A:  All right.  See you later (( )).
1 A:  Hi, how are you doing?
0 about a year.
0 B:  Right.
1 A:  -- be involved with drugs.
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 to save us all money [noise] as far as benefits and everything else --
0 A:  whether my co-worker is on drugs or not has, does not have an influence on
1 guess, uh, that they, that they accrue.
1 A:  Um, and I've gone to those classes. 
0 B:  And they dri-, and that's why, why I guess the car insurance has no, non
0 B:  Yeah, I guess that takes effect in, uh when.
0 A:  Well, that's, that's the problem, that's, you don't, how about, do you ea-,
1 do you like French fries?
1 B:  I do [laughter].
0 they're also saying that you'll have less likelihood of being sick --
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  -- if you don't smoke.
0 felt, if it, if those studies were true about [beep] smokers having higher
1 B:  -- and we do have one smoker in our area, who, and he, he seems to miss a
0 lot of work [laughter].
1 B:  -- eight, maybe.
0 B:  -- then they have a right to charge for [beep] that, too, I guess.
0 A:  -- we all know that French fries are not healthy for you.  It's the, it's
1 B:  It's the honor system, isn't it.
0 B:  It's the honor system, I know.  It will be an interesting experiment to see
0 B:  Right.
1 you know, a lot of times it's a [clicking] --
1 A:  Right, right, yeah.
0 A:  Well, I, I, I do, I do make that statement.  I say I do it because I like
1 B:  Nicotine addiction, yeah.
1 B:  Well, I can tell you're from, you've got that New England accent.
0 B:  Um.
0 B:  Oh, no, you can talk about anything you want.
0 B:  These things are just suggestions.
1 B:  Boring.
1 B:  Um, yes.
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 something.
1 B:  Yeah.  Somebody, somebody let the brains run out on the floor though.
0 B:  Oh, what a, what a dangerous individual.
0 B:  That's a, well, that's a good question.
0 A:  Okay.  
1 state, it would be a great place.
0 B:  Uh, Durham, the county right next to us --
0 A:  Oh, really.
1 never heard anything so preposterous in my life.
1 B:  Oh, well.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they say, Well, since
0 as garbage men --
0 B:  And teachers only get paid twenty-four.
1 A:  Man, I worked as a welder, and, uh, you don't even get paid that much
1 B:  Good exercise, you get outside.  Gee.
1 B:  Well.
0 now and then and leave it open for the dogs.
1 middle of my driveway.
0 B:  Jeez, I get tired of this.  I've got a, there's a nice little wooden
1 platform out there for the garbage cans.
0 B:  And then they throw them anywhere they want to.  And sometimes they don't
1 going to climb on a couple of pieces of wood and go racing down a slick
1 mountain side [laughter].
1 B:  I've got better things to do with my life.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.  I did, I did like the food in Germany.  It was pretty good.
1 B:  And, since I hate the French anyway,
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  And I, it was just miserable, I hated that place.
0 A:  Oh, my wife and I, we had it, when we drove through France, we paid in
1 A:  And we, like we bought, we filled a ful-, a cooler full of food, of all
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  And, and I mean, I, I, I just about kissed the guard.  
0 B:  Yeah, really.  I used to take the ferry over from Dover over to Calais --
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yeah, Oxbridge is nice.  Oh, everywhere in England is nice.
0 B:  But on the other hand, it's, it's, in a way it's better.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 pound.
1 A:  So I started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards, and things got
1 A:  Yep.
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 cards, it was, I was getting the money back, because I was selling it.  I
0 you know, rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- credit card applications --
0 B:  -- you know, of course you fill them all out because you're honored.
0 B:  And I don't know.
0 A:  Well, just today in the mail I got, uh, I got, got my guaranteed acceptance
0 B:  Oh, yeah, we've been getting those.
0 A:  And the bill would come in, and I'd pay it.  And the very first bill,
0 A:  Yeah, they were, I tell you.  They don't talk about they're charging that
0 pretty good, [talking] as far as credit cards go.
0 B:  I've got all my gas cards, because I don't want to carry money around.
1 A:  Yeah, exactly.
1 A:  Sure, naturally.  That's, I got into all kinds of trouble doing that
1 that an option.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  And, it, it's,
0 A:  #No,# I wish I did.
1 A:  Yeah, I could use a discount.  
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  ((Well, what else)),
0 A:  They, they used to be good.  I remember when they first opened up.  They
0 Merchandise is cheaper than them now.  So.
0 A:  It is great.  I love it.
0 A:  N C State.
1 A:  Little, the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh.  What a dead place
1 [laughter].
0 A:  They might be, but not at, not at the human factors level
0 [throat_clearing].  They, they're,
0 little suburb of Raleigh, just, just hired one more human factors person.
0 A:  Doggone it, if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been
0 A:  -- but, uh, I'm, I'm trying to get a, uh, intern position with I B M right
0 B:  Because you,
0 know.  What do you think?
1 A:  Because I remember even when I was growing up, I'm thirty-five 
1 B:  [Throat_clearing].
0 B:  Well, I've heard this one theory, that if, that if a kid commits a crime,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 this child in juvenile, and or, to me, yeah, both of them.
0 B:  Um.
1 right.
1 States has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Who's going to pay for mine?
1 B:  I don't know [laughter].
1 B:  I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.
1 B:  Okay.
0 A:  And killed them, well, it was two stores side by side.
0 A:  Anyway, they raped the women, beat them all up, including the women, I
0 A:  It's just getting really ridiculous down here.  I wish I could move
0 another thing.  Neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more.
0 stuff like that.
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  You never know.
0 A:  -- you know, and this is like across the street.  This was a nice part of
0 B:  Um.
0 neighborhood.
1 B:  [Throat_clearing].
1 A:  Well, when you decide to.
0 B:  [Laughter]  No, no, no.  I currently drive a, a Ford Taurus.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Oh, yeah, those were not good cars.
0 uh, an Accord --
0 comparably equipped, you know, with cruise control and air conditioning and A
0 still has that soft American ride.
0 to it.  But, my criteria, is simply something that looks good, something
0 you know, it's very comfortable on the highway.  I can drive for, you know,
0 for probably another two, three years of even looking, you know.
0 automobile --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  -- and well appointed and so forth, but to pay that much money for an
0 weeks ago, and, um, you know, of course they had the normal, the Ford, the,
0 B:  That's true.  Well,
1 A:  That's happened to me once,
1 A:  That was, had a great conversation, but, uh, then they came off and
0 A:  Bye-bye.
0 guess one of the things, I, I think metrically.  I've got a, uh, a, and it
0 drives my wife crazy, you know.  She'll say, How far is it from here to
1 give me this crazy look.
0 guess that's got me thinking metrically.  Also, uh, uh, we have lived
0 A:  And I guess you just get used to seeing distances beside the road marked
0 metrically --
1 physics there and then into college, um, where I was a physics major in
0 A:  Oh, yes, yes.
0 B:  -- that will finally get us into it, if we ever get into it.
0 A:  Yeah.  I, I, I don't think it's going to happen in, in, in our lifetime, at
0 A:  -- and I think that the, uh, the ultimate solution will be to start
0 introducing it, uh, in, at, at the introduction to school.
0 B:  Okay {silence}.
1 it.
0 B:  Right, [laughter] right, that may be true also.  I don't know, chemists
0 B:  No.
0 thinking now, in our business, you know, we make, we make chips.
0 A:  And, uh, we assemble them, though, and it's interesting.  We are, uh, uh,
1 A:  -- to the, to the base.  And we talk about that in terms of kilograms.
0 everything from basic research all the way through, uh, we have a couple of
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 system, but the ones that come up with the, they're doing these theoretical
0 A:  Right.  You, you mentioned just a satellite here, you mentioned you lived
0 Cantinas,
0 A:  Oh, okay, okay.  You're, you're yo-, you're a bit younger than I thought.
0 A:  But, it's going to be a big psychological barrier, and I don't think that
1 B:  Yeah, I don't,
0 it's base ten, rather, and so how can you have, how can you have these ...
0 B:  It's gotten so, though, that there are so many, you know, there are so
0 many, uh, I don't know what you call it.  Uh, so many different things that
1 you have to go through before they actually give the death penalty, that I'm
0 B:  Right, I know what you're saying.  Um, but, yeah, they, there's, you know,
1 there's always, uh, uh, you know, and, and in a way, you know, I guess that's
0 A:  Yeah, I, yeah, I agree with you there, too.
0 A:  Well, I'll agree with you there.  I don't agree with them showing it on
0 television --
1 B:  Well, where I could see it being very useful is for, you know, if there's a
0 B:  -- you know, what, what, you know, what might happen.  But, th-, you know,
0 for T V sta-, you know, that T V station isn't going to want to restrict how
0 and, and the, the right people will see it, and it'll deter them from
1 A:  -- you know, uh.
1 A:  -- and the most important part to a man and,
1 B:  Yeah, my wife says that all the time [laughter].
1 A:  inch by inch [laughter].
1 listening to her.  She's just a, she's,
1 A:   she's a little bit, uh, dingy when it comes to things,
1 was, was truly fair and, and, uh, and that they would never make a mistake
1 people who deserve a lot more, and, uh, that does, you know, that does sort
0 of a sudden he didn't exist any more.
0 Saddam Hussein,
0 A:  Yeah, that's what my husband keeps telling me.  See how, you know, um, I'm
1 A:  I don't put every-, a hundred percent stock into what he says,
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, well, I think they, uh, the people there will take care of him now.
0 has happened before in history, you know, that it just gets to a certain point
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 the big old antennas up so they can watch their T V when they're going.
1 A:  #That's not,#
1 B:  -- satellite dish [laughter].
1 B:  On top of the recreational vehicles.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.  We have a little bit and we've just gotten one of those little
1 tents [laughter],
0 rough it.
1 B:  #Oh no.#
1 A:  I mean, I know it's dangerous, I wouldn't do it now but we did [laughter].
1 A:  and told us to get inside our car.
1 B:  Gosh.  Bear bait [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] Bear bait.
1 cords and we've all got heaters in our tents.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 cords running from all these tents but we've got the fans going.
1 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  So that's really not roughing it so much #but# --
1 A:  I mean it's not very many miles from our house at all.  
1 A:  But they had [laughter] the time of their lives, you know.  
0 B:  [Noise].
1 A:  Instead of getting out all that stuff, you know.
0 B:  Right [laughter].
0 A:  #Yeah.#  Those double ones?
1 B:  Oh.  W-, we were looking at those in a magazine.  Last time we went, we
1 that way but something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient.
0 A:  [Cough].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  So I got a condo with a jacuzzi and it was wonderful.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.
0 A:  It's horrible.
0 A:  What do you write for stutter?  That, uh,
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Well, I guess that's it for camping, uh [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] [talking] I guess so unless you want to talk about stakes.
1 A:  What size stakes to put in [/talking].
1 miserable.  You just couldn-, everywhere you went there was sand.  You
1 A:  -- truck off Corpus, not,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Well, it's good talking to you.
0 A:  Yeah, I just got a little booklet, uh, this not what we're supposed to talk
1 B:  I know, I know, (( )) they.
0 @B:  Okay, just in case [laughter].
0 about on regular retirement.  Yeah, there's not too many, they do have a wing
1 just shun all responsibilities of any kind,
0 B:  Yeah, and get that youth back.
0 A:  Right.
0 fine.
0 A:  -- and, and our routine has (( )) obviously hectic with teenagers and
1 know.
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 A:  I'm afraid I'm a T V flipper.  Anything bad, I like, I like to,
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  I think,
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  I know, I know.  
0 to be treated --
1 Well, I'm going to build a little house behind yours,
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 to one of those places.
1 aren't you.
0 B:  Gosh.
0 A:  -- where you can go down and have a --
0 A:  -- make a meal, you know.  
1 dented a few things, you know,
0 B:  Right.
1 can afford the insurance, yeah.
0 B:  -- he hasn't had any accidents luckily.
0 B:  -- and that doesn't help.
1 A:  Well, everybody needs retraining.  It doesn't hurt, uh,
1 B:  At least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license
1 A:  Right, there you go, there's a good point --
0 that, and then the families,
0 getting back necessarily everything we'd like to, but so far, I don't think
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  That's, I think that's the biggest problem I have with the tax system is
0 there, there is such a disparity between, between really the haves and the
0 keep trying to, to close all the loopholes, and stop the abuse, and all
0 A:  Right.  It does seem to be the case.  I don't know whether it's worth, and
0 generally wanting to be in control of, of where everything's going for the
1 what they make anyway, in our income brackets.
0 A:  So, you know, those fifty thousand dollars, or the thirty thousand dollars
0 well, you might, might do all right.  I don't know.
0 B:  No.
1 shouldn't be --
0 peace we're not going to get stable oil prices, and, and, uh, I'd, I'd really
0 like to see stability in that area, because I'm always afraid that's where
0 B:  Really.
0 B:  But I have a, um, I have a lot of friends, you know, who are sort of
0 really promote a lasting peace, if there is not going to be a peace,
0 countries in history that has been told that they have to give back what they
1 took in a war, which they didn't start, basically, so.
0 there?
0 there, there's some central command post in Tampa {foreign location}, I think
0 was, um, a small country or small city, I think, or even, not actually in
1 B:  That's true.
0 hostilities with, uh, U S troops could still break out.
0 actually my wife is Syrian.  Um.
1 Um.
0 in Saudi Arabia, who are some friends in Saudi Arabia.  And, um, I have some
0 actually.
0 B:  Her parents who were born here would like to go see it, though, I think.
1 B:  -- right about now.
0 B:  You know, something about the place makes it not, not quite enjoyable.
0 dangerous to be out there, I guess.
1 B:  If that, so, if that, if that amounts for anything.
0 there at your house?
0 you ever had those?
0 A:  Oh.
1 and I used to have to go with rolls of, not, pocketful of change to buy all
1 this bread the kids would see me [laughter].
1 B:  Got the vocabulary down and everything.
1 Sixteen is the magic number for us.
1 B:  And I was the only Jew both nights.
0 sort of be, in, in, in, in my mind Passover is sort of a generic holiday
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 world sat down and took a nap together.
0 left.
1 A:  It sounds like a, it sounds like a John Lennon, uh, type.
1 all forms.
1 B:  Oh, yeah, some great sixties tunes.
1 A:  Uh, yeah, I'm in Plano.
1 B:  Uh, well, probably around the corner [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Do you play any instruments?
0 B:  I'm not musically gifted at all.
1 A:  Well, I took piano lessons in fourth grade once for,
1 B:  Ms. Burkhalter.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  It may have been a girl thing.
1 A:  Well, I have no idea what that is [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, I went to, I went to, uh, Rice, and we had the marching owl band --
1 A:  Well, it was a lot of fun, plus I got to get to go to all the athletic
1 events free [laughter].
1 B:  Um, there, uh, Black Sabbath did a few albums that I really like
1 B:  I love that album.
0 radio contests.
1 before I even had a stereo to play them on, to play them on.
0 A:  Um, yeah, but not the same type of contests.  They have contests on the
1 A:  They sent me a small flag in the mail that, whi-, which had postage due
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 especially in rock and roll.  There's not just too much, uh, new stuff that's,
1 B:  It doesn't seem to be.
1 A:  Course the head bangers, I stay away from those entirely.
1 A:  Certainly is.  Just turn on M T V any night.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 you know, really go the whole way, and I couldn't go with even, with most of
0 stations even.
1 B:  Yeah, they've got, they've, now they've got some good videos.
1 A:  Uh, very good videos, yeah, I'm kind of impressed [laughter].
1 Steve Winwood.
0 B:  And, uh, but I spend enough time on scan that I hear what i-, what is still
0 A:  Well, who's, uh, who's, who's popular now with the, uh, contemporary
0 A:  Yeah.
1 you know, this that and the other.
1 A:  Well, I don't think I'd ever make a song writer [laughter].
0 her big time.
0 A:  Okay.
1 yeah, it's ve-, its definitely Christian, but it's not, it's not hymns
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Right, okay [laughter].
0 A:  Okay, yeah, I still feel like every time, if I ever feel like reminiscing
1 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  My name's Ken,
1 A:  Everybody's in Texas.  God,
0 B:  Right.
1 A:  But I wonder how much longer they're going to be a them.
0 very dangerous --
0 A:  I mean, I've heard stories now where the, where the, um, the military is
0 going to cause a, more civil war than is already occurring.
1 A:  That's interesting.  I, I wonder, I don't know if he's, he, he seems, the
0 B:  Well.
0 Soviet Union, um, how different the people there really are, you know.  How
0 B:  That's one of the places I would most like to go.  Not right now, of 
1 course --
0 some point, to go see what, what this is like, I mean, this, this is amazing,
0 country.  You be this way.  It's a, I think it's a sad state of affairs, but.
0 A:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  
0 now, and I don't think it's that different from what the Baltic states are,
0 A:  And they have like a problem, they have (( )) Muslims to deal with --
0 of land.
1 B:  And that's, they don't all have their own country, and, and some of them
0 A:  Right, uh, I wonder, I wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union don't
0 our houses they don't get anything, much, they get a little jewelry and maybe,
1 just moved into a house that has lots of windows, and I, course I have a
1 that'll do any good.
1 A:  Are you serious?
1 B:  [Laughter] I'm serious (( )).
0 B:  Yeah.
0 it.  We're not in a bad area, you know.  I,
0 door with a dead bolt on it and they backed up and put their foot to it, and
0 kicked it in, molding and all.
0 B:  Oh that's scary, because --
0 through looking.
0 wouldn't you think the people that are breaking in are probably --
0 supposed to, but anyway, the idea of how much money would it take to reform
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Everything (( )).
1 B:  Yeah, but who buys silver any more?
0 worth a lot, but, uh, what are they going to do, walk down the street,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And uh, the, the kids maul the dog something awful.  They pull his tail,
0 and bend his ears and, uh, have a good time playing with him and the dog is
0 A:  Well, you've got part of your family up here then.    
1 B:  Uh, oh.    
1 if you yank a dog's tail real hard, he lets go of a bird.  #[laughter] Uh,#
1 [laughter].
0 his own cage.  He just, uh, flew lose in the house all the time.  Uh, but uh,
0 rabbits right now.  We have one doe and one buck,
0 B:  and she ought to be due sometime toward the end of this week on a litter.
0 back up.
1 rabbit spelled backwards.
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 how did you get that name, I said, well, that's gerbil spelled backwards
1 [laughter] {faint}.
1 I went over to, I found them sleeping, and I went over and picked one of them
0 A:  Yeah.  But I tried again a few weeks later but this time I put on some
1 leather gloves and my father still wondered what happened to those leather
1 gloves [laughter].
1 little test that they're trying to do.
1 far as, what you would like to do with your life.  But by the same token, and
0 difficult.  There are more things to work out.  I know when I was working, you
0 pleasing, you know, your boss on the job, so you have added stresses from
0 the other responsibilities are still important.  Um, so, um, have you, have
0 B:  #Yes.#    
0 B:  Uh-huh.    
1 instinct.
0 husbands.
0 B:  [Children] Well, what do you think, [noise] {water running}though, um, um,
0 so many women, younger women now are choosing to go outside is, I feel that in
1 up and watch soap operas,#
1 B:  you know.  I wish I was the one, I would stay home with my kids if my
0 A:  If my wife had an education and could support us, and the only value I see
0 a daughter,
0 B:  #Right.  Right [noise].#   
0 A:  #picking children up from school# and,   
1 to her husband about how she ought to vote.
0 A:  #Now it probably# doesn't work that way in our household because I have
1 have to examine though and although your husband's probably been as much
1 B:  #um,#  
0 roles switching.    
0 A:  Sure.    
1 spending too, as well, so, 
0 A:  Uh, 
0 doing, 
1 really sav-, it's savings if we don't spend it.
0 A:  It, it doesn't come out, um, it doesn't come out of long term savings, like
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  that's what we hit.  
0 A:  Right, the only time you know about it is when it comes due and they'll
0 whatever.
0 CODA?
0 little bit better than ours.  Um, she hasn't been working for a couple of
0 in, you know, we just rolled that over, 
0 A:  but they kind of spread the payments out, And we stuck to that pretty
0 B:  Yeah.
1 ran it like you run it now.
0 you know, use the teller machine, or if she needs something, she'll go and
1 my pocket, that's, that's a lot.  It's,
0 B:  Yeah, to some extent, I guess so.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Um, maybe younger people are different, I'm not sure.
0 B:  Yeah, they probably don't have enough to [laughter].
0 other companies too, just here and there.
0 A:  Oh, yeah, it's not just, yeah it's not just TI they, they're doing the same
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  but that, that kind of takes away from public service.
0 B:  That's right [laughter].  Yeah, they probably couldn't do anything
0 A:  That's right.  
0 B:  but I, I think it can't be something that's mandatory.
0 A:  Yeah. Yeah.
0 B:  and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs,
1 B:  Although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from
0 B:  You know, it be, it wouldn't take up much, much, it would take up more 
0 but they don't know where to go to, to,
0 A:  Okay, take care.
0 A:  Bye-bye.
1 A:  Yeah.   
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  The, um, I remember last year, wasn't it raining #a lot this, yeah,#
0 A:  #you know,# quite a lot.  Um, it's not, it doesn't usually damage any
0 businesses or anything, but you can't get off of thirty-five.
1 B:  I di-,
1 A:  to go to Home Depot and that's a problem [laughter].  
1 B:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Oh, gosh, yes, uh, the [laughter], a lot of people go
1 there [laughter] [sniffing].
1 B:  so it's, it's, ev-, the weather down here is a lot different than, than
1 Pennsylvania, so.
0 B:  #No.#  I like the winters, but I don't like the summers down here.  #It,#
0 B:  it's terribly hot in the summer here.   
1 B:  I just, when we moved down here, our, we had a, our vehicle didn't have an
0 A:  Sure.  
1 B:  But, um, oh, we suffered that first summer.  We traded that thing in
1 have air conditioning.
0 A:  Down here, yeah, I'd , j-, I, think it's a necessity.  We, um, we have, uh,
0 B:  #I just really don't.#  Th-,  
1 A:  No.   
1 B:  Because of the wi-, winter [laughter], 
0 B:  That wa-, that is surprising.  And I, I, it was, uh, really odd.
0 B:  as we were coming into town and then it snowed a half a foot.
1 A:  Oh, my gosh.   
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  but, uh, but the, the ice is really bad [sniffing] because it knocks out
0 power lines and, and you just, you just absol-, at least when you've got snow,
1 A:  It doesn't matter, right.   
0 A:  The kids could play in it, but it would be a bright sunny day and, #you
0 know,#
1 B:  #Did, oh, the, they are everywhere.#  They,
1 A:  That's true.  Certainly not localized [laughter].  
1 B:  #It just, everything just kind of gives up# and dies here [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.  It just turns brown and makes a mess [laughter].   
1 B:  No, it j-, the, the trees just go to about the first of December and then
0 {pause} #this year.#
1 corner on that [laughter].
1 B:  On the, on the real nice color.  But, uh, I, I like spring, I like, I like
0 A:  #put# her outside and, #hey, she's fine.# 
1 B:  And just, well, I think long winters would really mess up, mess her up.
0 day,
1 B:  [Sniffing].
1 A:  #But he's# used to it now, I think.  He's, I mean, he certainly doesn't
1 just like a shock.
1 B:  It just, I just couldn't, it was just oppressive, the heat down here.
1 A:  [Noise] That's a good word for it [laughter].
1 B:  And I just couldn't, um, [laughter] make my family understand.  This is
1 hot [laughter].
1 A:  Hopefully we'll have some more good weather but,   
0 B:  Okay.  Take it easy.   
0 we accumulate and recycle an-,
0 B:  And, and you, and you also get rid of it so,
1 A:  Well, this is Texas it doesn't set, it blows.
1 A:  Lots of grass, give it twenty-four hours and the whole things gone,
0 else's but, uh, the problem that bothers me more are, uh, you know, I think,
0 the communities will do as good as they are supported by their local
0 management --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Exactly.
0 A:  It's horrible.
0 A:  -- and it starved to death.  It couldn't,
0 A:  Trust us, it's our nets.
0 B:  -- not, not environmentalist.
0 A:  Well, and, you know they could, they could be terribly sorry they're
0 killing the turtles, you know.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yeah.  Yeah, I had turtle when I was in Vietnam, didn't know
1 A:  -- but, of course, a boot would taste fabulous when they finish with it.
0 they are putting in there, you know.  Oh, this is turtle soup, you know --
0 B:  -- Okay.  Sure.  Right.
1 B:  It's probably, it's probably Campbells or something.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 politicians that are more sensitive because I think we can't do it ourselves.
0 the end results is, is just anality, nobody is getting anything done and, and
0 B:  Yeah.  I mean, I mean, ideally they would all combine together and pool
1 B:  Exactly,

0 B:  yeah.    
1 America type thing, you know.
1 B:  Yeah, really [laughter].

1 B:  my kids are going to be hating me,     
1 A:  Really.
0 B:  you know [laughter].   
1 A:  So,

0 SIMPSON'S and I don't care for it too much.  My kids, you know, sit there an
0 A:  [/child_talking].  What's that?
0 B:  That, my, I don't care for THE SIMPSON'S too much, but my husband likes it,
0 B:  I don't get the humor sometimes in it, so.
0 A:  uh, he doesn't understand what they're saying and half the time I'm glad
0 A:  Well, we just moved to Texas.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  Uh,
0 A:  Oh, okay.
1 B:  Uh, yeah, I do, I guess I like that one.

0 A:  O-, you know, every three days we go back and return them, and,
0 B:  Oh, not him, he'll watch a little bit of everything, so.  But I, you know,

1 A:  [laughter].
1 A:  Uh, so we have to get up and flip the ch-, channels.   
1 [laughter].
1 channels, so.  But, yeah, that's my, about my favorite, so.  [noise].
1 A:  nice talking to you.

1 sister who lives in Florida, and she plants her garden in January.
0 A:  Harvest in May. 
0 B:  Oh.
0 summertime you just can't grow anything, and we tried to plant in like end of
0 B:  Isn't that when, when, I thought that was when you were supposed to plant.
0 A:  Oh, here it gets so hot, 
1 B:  It does eat up the, um, eats up your water bill, I know that. 
0 B:  But, um, I don't know, I've, I, I just prefer having someone else do it, to
1 B:  He made us do the grunt work. 
0 B:  My son only five so he's not old enough yet to send out to the, do the yard
1 work.
1 B:  In about five more years maybe. 
0 other house and it was already landscaped and I, you know, I didn't know what
1 A:  but we didn't do it right. 
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  so, we'll probably wait and maybe in the fall, we might plant a fall
0 it is just too hot.
0 got to get up at six in the morning to do it before, you know, before it gets

0 excellent, uh, liver which I happen to like.
0 went to some steak houses while I was out there and there was this one place
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
1 the,
1 A:  I forget the, the other one, the he-man or something like this,
0 A:  and, um, and I, I, I found it, uh, to be very good.  The atmosphere was
1 table, she reached across the table.
0 B:  She never once asked if we wanted coffee, we had to grab onto someone else.
1 and she just pitched it out,
0 A:  See how one, one place, one person can make a big difference on whether you
0 go back to the place again.
0 the service and resented paying fifteen percent tip when they had such poor
0 service,
0 B:  Yes, right, right.
1 right on top of these dirty tables.
1 mouth.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, right.
1 B:  And that really up sets me when I see that.
1 A:  [Laughter] I can certainly understand that.
0 she, um, she frequently finds food struck onto the utensils,
0 B: Yeah.
0 B:  No, no.  And actually, you know, those are the kind of things that should
0 B:  Yes.
1 A:  something back to look at the ones that she's, um, bringing over to you
1 instead of just grabbing a handful [laughter] and bring them over again.
1 lipstick on it.
1 where, but it's always, one time is enough for me to be aware of the
0 didn't go that often,
0 often, but once in a while.
0 there's going to be tonight [laughter] with Duke and, um, Kansas City, um,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Um.
1 A:  I'm Jerry Crow from Dallas.
0 B:  Hi, Jerry.  [laughter] Uh,
0 A:  Where, where you from?
0 B:  T V shows.
1 A:  Yeah.  What we like about them, our favorites and so forth.
0 A:  Like H S E and E S P N.  But the mo-, movie sh-, uh, cables or movie
1 B:  And decided he'd, he had enough of it.
1 you,
0 B:  Do you still,
0 A:  early retirement.
0 B:  Rooting for Duke Uni-,
1 A:  in fact, it's on tonight. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Um, ...
0 B:  we do to.
0 all the stocks.

0 B:  Uh-huh.  [laughter].
1 A:  And I'm definitely not a soap fan,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  We don't watch that much.
0 A:  and get involved in them.
0 B:  I don't either.  I just don't have any,
0 B:  Yeah.  They had a program on the other day about people that were addicted

1 A:  -- in case you miss it.
0 A:  Yeah.  Well,
1 off.
1 A:  Well, you have a good day.
1 A:  So, uh,
0 burying me but it will be there when I get back.  Flex times another benefit
1 us starting before six thirty so.  Uh, it wasn't too much of a blow but, uh,
1 A:  the people that we were interfacing facing didn't like that too well
0 dental and all that, it is a bo-, a, a, a plus to have that, ev-, as far as
0 your, uh, salary goes, you know, along with it because it's not out of pocket
0 B:  Well, they match half, I guess it is. 
0 B:  And, um, [smack] I think that a lot of it's the personal recognition that
0 things.  I think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people and
0 interface but when you get a big company like ours, I think it's great that
0 they take the time to, you know, give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's
1 A:  must use? 
0 B:  ((Oh)), 
0 A:  year round.
0 when the kids are out of school, I can manage to be home in time to, uh, take
0 care of the kids before the wife leaves, she works, uh, oh, it starts about
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 started with some vacation time, uh, it just did, they had to schedule it
0 A:  -- if the job has got something, you know, something worth doing as far as
0 technicians in the toolroom.  So you're kind of like your own boss as far as
1 A:  pick up something that adds to both your, your security and your
0 A:  Well,
0 B:  And they offer, um, a lot of, uh, opportunity to go to school.
0 A:  Yeah.  I've, I've looked at several, uh, courses as it were, the only
0 courses that apply to our job other than the real basics, like just the math
0 B:  Right.  Well, my degree is in teaching, so.
0 B:  Oh, really.
1 for a while and decided, nope, not for me.
1 A:  I thought I was going to be smart and get the good kids, wrong.
0 don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the
0 possible, teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools.
1 A:  Well, that's a nice way of putting it.
0 A:  Uh, accept for the private ones, of course, we're talking about public.
1 gave it to me."  And I didn't believe it for a minute.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  But not a lot I could do about it.
0 A:  Oh, sure.  I mean, i-, i-, it's indicative across the board that we, we've
0 semester --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  #Well,#
1 A:  I don't know.  What can we do about it?
1 B:  Goo-, good question [laughter].
0 B:  and in the, the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  to students because they're going get, they're going to get complaints or
0 A:  [Cough].
1 A:  Well, lawyers help create that [laughter].
0 A:  {Rattling sounds like moving the phone} [cough].
0 A:  That's interesting.  I remembering reading a few cases about that when it,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and wou-, I just think I shou-, would like to go to my own hospital where
0 B:  Well [breathing], 
0 A:  What if that, what if, because of, because of expense is that,
0 B:  Yes, I do.
1 alone and, and, you know, it's hard for me.  I don't go to the doctor unless
1 I'm really sick [laughter],
1 don't use it that much either, uh, of course, I'm using it right now
1 [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] (( )).
1 B:  I had a little skiing accident here in this last month and [laughter],
0 A:  [Breathing]. 
0 B:  separated the shoulder a little bit.
1 A:  Oh, my God.
1 B:  No.  No, I didn't even miss work,
1 A:  You didn't?  [laughter].
0 B:  Just stick it in a sling and go on [laughter].
1 A:  So.
1 bit and,
1 don't know if that he are getting any closer.  The problem is that some people
1 A:  I think we have,
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  Well,
1 A:  But no profits right now.
1 A:  I think when we, when we start showing profit, which I hope we do pretty
1 B:  Um.
1 A:  Uh, I hate to tell you, I'm in payroll.
1 B:  Oh, really?  [laughter].
1 many, uh, I'm a supervisor and, I (( )), I (( )) the thing,
0 about it [laughter] or not.
0 B:  I think the concept's great, you know. 
1 B:  Fourteen.
1 A:  Oh, fourteen.  Well, okay, division one was worse [laughter].
1 A:  And boy when we put them on, oh, my God, the phone.  You'd hang up and it
0 before and I don't do it now so I don't have anything to compare that with.
0 everybody seems to be able to learn.  You know,
0 A:  it's been really good.
1 B:  Well, that's, that's one of the benefits that I, uh,
1 A:  That's a T I benefit too [laughter].
0 payroll were involved in supervisors and all but, uh, I came in last year out
1 B:  Um.
1 they said now forget the old system.  Oh, yeah, sure [laughter].
0 A:  I think.  So, but that's just from my point of view.  Like I said I don't
1 B:  That's all right.
1 B:  No, I'm not (( )).  I only worry with it one time a week when I'm, well,
1 twice really [laughter],
1 B:  Yeah, right.
0 A:  for you and now all you have to do is go in and put in a number --
0 A:  -- and you got it, you know.  So, uh, just put people in, pick a number and
1 B:  You fire all your people and they, uh,
0 B:  Uh, no.  Actually, the wall behind the paper was smooth so, I just used a,
0 A:  -- and it was smooth and, uh, and we would, we put this stuff on and, and
0 through I wished we hadn't done it because we were, you know, we were trying
0 panelling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or
0 A:  Have you, have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to
0 Depot, I think it was, and, and took a, uh, a copy, took a piece of brick --
0 and then they wanted some gray to do the, to do the trim.
0 look like this and you want that to look like that and,
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, uh, what we've got ours painted now is
0 A:  So you, so what's your, what's the solution then? 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 thought, uh, you know, we did the one wall but the other trim, I'm trying to
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 interesting that the white, um, makes the rooms look bigger.  One of the, in
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  -- uh, it has the, the, the living room has four, uh, good size windows
0 A:  Yeah.  We have a lot of light, yeah.  And, well, it, it, it, um, well, it's
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Okay.  Good-bye. 
0 and it seems like almost a opposite, but I guess I got away from what I
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 those that call on those classical, uh, roots, I guess, uh, Barry Manilow
0 influences by classical music and I'm still, still, my favorite, in fact most
0 B:  That could well be.  I, I, uh, [lipsmack] spent my junior year, uh, and
0 evoked memories of, of difficult times in school being behind on work,
1 tune to Downtown they know to just stay away,
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 understand what is that other people take for granted,
0 B:  in composition themes and I, keys and things are something to me that
0 good mathematical concept for what's involved,
1 music people are supposed to go hand in hand but,
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 through the, uh, parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going
1 out to play thing,
1 A:  Just never got a chance to come out.  No.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 want come back?
0 because I know that's the kind of food I wanted to eat.
0 the next couple of weeks.  It's a, I just found out that, well I'm sure
0 B:  Um.  
0 B:  Yeah,  
0 A:  of course that's probably a lot easier on T V to figure it out than it is
0 B:  Yeah, that does sound like a pretty neat idea.  
1 A:  you know how far it is from your house or whatever?  
1 A:  I guess that's.  Yeah, I, I think my favorite restaurant is always been
1 usually that much time or,
1 B:  oh,  
1 B:  that's what I figured, but ... 
0 col-, I'm a university student so, uh,
1 B:  when you're flat broke all the time [laughter].  
0 B:  But, uh,  
0 A:  So you grad-,
1 B:  well actually I graduated with a B S in (( )) in eighty-eight [sniffing]
0 and I've been to school every since [laughter],
0 A:  I mine a little bit, yeah, 
0 A:  whereas I, you know, I have gone to a couple of these things bef-, you
0 A:  Um. 
1 B:  and I don't go to them, I don't eat hamburgers anymore but ...
1 A:  [Laughter] Well unfortunately I'm not as good about that as you are,
0 A:  I still go every once one in awhile.
1 B:  I used to just, I, I used be a connoisseur of hamburger places
1 [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  Mike's Grill that's the place to go for the best burger.  
1 ...
1 quite that bad, but, uh,
0 A:  Yeah, take care,
0 nice, so you're probably in a, you know,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 nicest that I found, and, uh, they're almost five hundred a month
0 and we refinanced, and it, but it was like eight hundred and
0 something, but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty --
0 B:  -- in, yeah, in, actually they're near Plano in North Dallas
1 after a while [laughter].
1 a while and came back and, uh, we lived in a smaller city, and
0 A:  -- it's moving north.
0 B:  -- it's really sad because they're not doing anything, well
0 A:  Wow.
1 B:  Yeah, it's really, and we didn't think it was that clean, but
0 fifty, hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here,
1 enclose and you can sell it [laughter].
0 A:  And they don't have to worry about yard upkeep if they don't
1 A:  That's true, there's not too many basements in Texas.
1 B:  And I said, You haven't heard about tornados [laughter].
0 Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, and, uh, we used to call the
0 here, you know.
0 B:  -- and everything, you know, it's,

1 enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall
1 general contractor,
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, no thanks, I,
1 thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit
0 A:  Oh, you bet.
0 B:  I know I'm supposed to talk about homes, but people that, the
1 know, um, spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies,
0 you know, that maybe --
0 knew what to do with.  I don't know --

0 A:  Are you a native Texan? 
1 mine, they have a fifth wheel trailer that they pull.
0 B:  Yeah, that's kind of cheating isn't it? 
0 B:  Absolutely beautiful country to, country to camp in. 
0 we had some old army cots that we would sleep on, uh, come good weather or not
0 many of times we were sleeping out under the stars and it would start raining
1 and we would all wind up in the car and that got pretty cramped sometimes.
0 B:  And a ceiling fan and screened, uh, windows.  So you can kind of go in
0 they have got a dock that you can tie up, tie up and it's, and it's in
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  And, uh, you know, we will leave him down there at ten o'clock with his
0 A:  But, you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes
0 acre, in fact they have acquired some more now, that they are going, they're
0 B:  That's right, I'd forgotten then all about the Texan side.  and that's but
0 you got to be a member of Texans to use it.
0 B:  Yeah.

0 A:  We could suck up thirty gallons in an afternoon of skiing.

1 A:  -- twenty years, going from, well, take it back, thirty years
0 unti-, well, unless, if you were educated you got, you know, you

0 more than you're going to make at the job.
0 A:  Yeah, I, at least for a lot of women --
0 B:  Uh-huh.  So you figure one of these days you're going to go
1 A:  Well, actually I've found out that I'm not going to go back
0 B:  Oh, okay, you've found something else.
1 B:  -- the same person every day.

0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap.  And so,
0 B:  -- some time day care is really good, but sometimes, it's
0 here's what we expect of you.
1 from trashing something.  
1 A:  [laughter]  Yes, I understand, I wait until I put mine in bed
1 before I make my calls.  [laughter]

1 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  [laughter].  Of course.  Who can't use that. 
0 B:  It's real bad. 
0 A:  No.  
1 A:  And he said, uh, this is serious folks, this is serious business, stay
0 A:  That, of course that was last year when we had the real bad freeze, you
1 B:  -- and, um, he went home for Easter and it snowed up there and then the
1 A:  Is that right? 
1 B:  Yeah.  That would be horrible.  [laughter].
1 A:  [laughter].
1 B:  I wouldn't like that.  [laughter].  Where you just can't depend on it.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Spring and fall are nice times of the year. 
1 A:  Spring, because we're getting tha-, getting rid of winter finally.
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah.  No kidding.  
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really is.  It's just an old gray looking sky and it's
0 bad to visit.  And we, we love to go skiing and, um, now it's beautiful when
0 but I sure couldn't live there.
0 A:  areas.  I mean, uh, 
0 B:  Uh.
0 A:  -- and one day it was, must have been close to ten degrees above zero,
1 A:  If I walk, it will be ten degrees warmer, but it will last twenty minutes.
0 A:  Which do I want, you know --  
1 A:  so I took the shorter, colder option,
1 for sure at that point.
1 A:  It does. 
1 B:  #Yeah.  It hurts#. 
1 @@A:  Yeah.  Oh, well, I don't know what else I can say about it. 
1 B:  Well, me either.  [laughter].  It's kind of a boring topic, I guess. 
1 A:  Yeah. You and me both. 
0 B:  And I use my personal computer constantly, not only do I do P C type things
0 B:  So all I have on my desk is my P C, but I'm, I'm getting, not only our

1 B:  to do work.  If I had a machine already installed at home I would

0 machine so that we could, in my home, so that we could make it through this
0 producing transparencies and things.
1 A:  Have, uh, really, what's the word I'm looking for, I'm just totally
1 drawing a blank [laughter].
1 A:  Just the power, I'm, I'm trying to, uh, get an updated machine.  Mine, uh,
1 A:  Yeah. 
1 B:  I don't know [laughter] if my boss will spring for it.
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  But I'm determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one.
1 B:  We think about that a lot. 
0 A:  Right.  The copy that you can (( )) with one of those as compared to one of
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Oh, huh-uh.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  And carry it over to there, and see if they're not using the printer,
0 B:  And now N C N B's got a little larger market share, but it's the only, uh,
1 the audit department of this, this huge holding company, sharing a H P Rugged
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  I was going oh, wait a minute [laughter]. 
1 A:  No.  I had to press one.
1 B:  Good [laughter]. 
0 B:  Oh, you agree with Schwartzkopf who says, uh, Drive on into Baghdad.
1 B:  Wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country.
0 impossible.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  [Laughter] It would be really nice because I'm kind of tired of driving
1 B:  you all drive at fifty-five, don't you?  What's that?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Uh, know, virtually nothing else.
0 A:  [Laughter] Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Really. 
1 B:  Yeah, I know, it's a funny degree [laughter]. 
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 gulf and it's really interesting.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  So tell me about where you live. 
0 A:  Oh, I don't even know.  I have no clue. 
1 B:  Close to sea level? 
0 B:  Okay, uh, right here in Colorado Springs where I live --
1 B:  -- it's over six thousand foot. 
1 A:  Oh, well, see, um, [laughter]. 
0 of fresh seafood --
1 jeans, we'd drive an hour.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 smaller than Butler and, um, Butler, Butler is about an hour north east of
0 B:  So are you working your way through college? 
0 B:  So, uh, what do you plan to do with it? 
1 B:  Savings and loans, uh,
0 something.
0 B:  But, now under employment I would suspect to run closer to eighteen or
0 A:  Yeah.  It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs.
0 B:  Yes.  It is. 
0 A:  I know people they are out of school for two or three years and they have a
0 B:  Holy cow, I just walked in.  I, I didn't, [noise] even I guess, uh,
0 just couldn't, #couldn't hang with them.#
0 U N L V so,
0 A:  Because I think if they would play their game I don't know if there's
1 just all kinds of problems.
1 A:  Oh, really. 
0 for him and if they, just keep him that hurts their salary cap.  So that guy's
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Oh, uh, not McCrane, but, uh, let's see are you, uh, Perkins? 
0 B:  He was good. 
0 he's been hurt.  But he hadn't, he hadn't played in probably two months.  And,
0 A:  It, uh, you know, #I bet it was.#
0 Perkins.  I think he was a free agent or, uh, yeah, free agent.  His contract
0 was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something
0 like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles.  So he just went where the
0 A:  And, uh, so now it would be really to their benefit to, uh, really play,
0 A:  You know, the Suns are pretty good.
0 B:  Did you say white or black?
0 A:  No, they sure didn't.  Sure didn't. 
0 was ranked like number two most of the year.
0 A:  Yeah, so it's a tough conference, huh.
1 ends up.
1 B:  Yeah.  We'll see [laughter]. 
1 B:  Uh-huh {Very faintly}.
1 A:  And I mean you can, you can buy an extra screen [laughter].
0 A:  And I found, uh, my son is, um, uh, second year college
0 type your papers, at least with a Mac,
1 A:  he was willing to sit down and,
1 A:  So he's basically, you know, whatever the computer can do for you, fine,
1 A:  I'll learn enough to, to make it work well for me, but I'm not going to be
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 can do and, and how it can work.  
1 because,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 you'd, you'd, oh, w-, I did that I know I did that. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  You know and then the results come back and no you didn't [laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 [throat_clearing],
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yell at them [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] I know there must be something more I can do with
0 A:  Well it's been very interesting. 
0 B:  Okay have a good day. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 thousand plastic milk jugs,
0 guys will pick it up.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  They used to have several places, um, that were a little ways out in the
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  #That's right.#
0 A:  Uh-huh, yes.
1 B:  where it used to be.
0 not, I think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do
0 this,
1 A:  Yeah,
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  you know [laughter],  
0 that e-, originally they thought the disposables were just awful,
0 B:  but now their saying that they're, ther-, really not that much in
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  #uh, refuse.#
1 B:  but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to
1 A:  That's right, absolutely,
0 B:  in, I don't know if those are recyclable or,
0 aluminum,
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, now when we lived out in California they actually had places
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Our church has a #place,#
0 A:  You know, our church each year has a, one of their major fund raisers is,
0 B:  Oh. 
0 recycle.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Okay, well, it was nice talking to you. 
0 A:  Well, I think, uh, you know, from an elementary standpoint it would help to
1 B:  #Exactly.#
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 Not like I was in school and do two weeks on it, in a math class and that's
0 the United States adult population to automatically relearn and switch,
0 of a double sign with a a big miles per hour and a little kilometers per hour,
1 A:  #and then# over the years the, the kilometers per hour gets bigger than
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  Yeah.
0 be a lot more education involved than there is right now,
1 B:  #Yeah,# so.  Yeah, we're not, uh, we're not necessarily cutting edge in
0 and a lot of time and like I said, I was just totally amazed at how, at how
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  #are, are# made with miles per hour and kilometers on #them.#
0 A:  Uh, sort of hidden on the scale which shows kilometers,
0 temperature is thirty-seven degrees centigrade.
1 B:  Right. 
1 A:  #and that it's# a nice day when it's twenty-five degrees outside
1 [laughter],
1 and three degree fever and, you know, just say it's thirty-nine is not just
1 going to sound very bad [laughter].
0 B:  #Well, see it's, it,# it's really just a suburb, uh, I really can't even
0 B:  Right. 
0 really hasn't been a problem.  It's been, uh, uh, mostly outsiders coming in
0 A:  And Providence is only like a dozen miles from, from where I am.
0 driving along whether they're, they're in their early twenty's or, or teens,
1 tennis shoes.
1 A:  #Yeah,# yeah no shoe is worth that, that price.
0 something, or you, you bash somebody over the head.
0 A:  #Or you starve.#
0 B:  #Well ano-,# another problem I think is the, the drugs, you know, uh,
0 A:  but they did, they made the raid and the whole town was upset.  But I'm
0 that alcohol now is, is, uh, one of the major contributors.
0 it's, it's terrible.
0 B:  Right.
0  
0 five murders,
0 B:  common occurrence.  
0 B:  [Talking].
0 B:  #Well, see, I'm not either because I'm,# I'm really not for higher taxes,
1 spot, you know,
1 B:  Well, let's see, well, we assume I was an adult twenty years ago,
0 B:  we were heavy into affirmative action. 
0 B:  Um, on other fronts, um,
0 individually, rather than collectively.
0 incremental.  They've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made,
0 and things like that.
0 lot of pessimism growing, um, and at the same time I think there's, there's,
0 increased corporate responsible towards, uh, you know, environmental safety
0 achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that, you know,
1 B:  I mean, you know [laughter]. 
1 about the environmental movement, um, it's, it's been a long time coming, um,
1 and being a, uh, a very old hippie [laughter].
1 B:  I mean, you know, if you had long hair in high school in the sixties, you
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah. 
1 A:  And that's a real change, except it sort of, brings back to the nineteen
1 forties more than anything else [laughter].
0 A:  I mean, all this recycling used to be in tact,
0 A:  #Yes.#  
1 B:  #started# making profits #off,#
0 them.  Uh, I had, when I was down in Dallas for two years, I had, uh, my
0 B:  You know, I had a real problem with that. 
0 teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society.  I mean,
0 more, uh, a real low income sort of job and very low prestige.  I mean,
1 there's that, that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach,
0 A:  And if you have that kind of social attitude it's hard to get sufficient
0 B:  And although we don't have any criminal actions here, we do have other, um,
0 have, um, very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents
0 and such.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Yeah, you know, some (( )) I don't, you always have the option, now in
0 jury,
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 money there isn't being spent but there's awful lot of money in time and
1 sometimes, you know, the juries come down with a result and you go, gee
0 A:  And I knew the people involved, both the people who d and the people who,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 you know, what are we doing for them, we're kind of, you know, forgetting
0 seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 the likelihood ((certainly)) ((tilts it)).
1 who had, uh, been in seminary to become a priest, and,
1 A:  So, we do have some problems and it seems to me that, uh, maybe it's time
1 to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, that would be ((wrongful)). 
0 to be a paralegal and, uh, uh, they barred priors on this, uh, person and they
0 has to be an intent, you know, has to be not just the act but you have to
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  sit on a jury like that and you'd still, you know, I want ask some
1 trees and creeks to play in and it was a lot of fun.
1 A:  So, you like that more civilized kind of camping (( )) [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 weather starts getting funny, it will be warm one day and freezing the next.
1 A:  So, but that's also about the time you start getting cabin fever.
1 A:  Um, but I woke up and the snow was halfway up the, the front of the tent.
1 A:  I'm going oh, no. 
1 I'll go play around for a while.
0 B:  How did you get out of that? 
0 B:  Oh, that's awful. 
1 A:  Yeah, so I, I trotted back to the car rather quickly, uh, jumped in, went
1 home, and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back [laughter].
0 A:  I don't understand these peop-, people take these camper trailers,
1 A:  I mean that's like,
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 [whispering], Tara would you hold on just a moment, please [/whispering].
1 [laughter].
1 A:  were suppose to be taking a nap, and one just crawled up in my lap,
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  especially, especially this one. 
1 B:  Well, you're my third one and I have never gotten the courage to do it
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 and things you can get and,
1 B:  I started getting inspired thinking, oh, we need to do this, I'd like ((
0 B:  Huh.  Well, that's pretty neat. 
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, every time I've talked to them, (( )) my husband said I can't
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 does it.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  But they, on the other hand, too, they cost twenty-five hundred dollars
1 B:  Oh, my land.  I'd be scared to dead to have anything that expensive
0 A:  and I keep saying no, no, no,
0 B:  Yeah, I guess so. 
1 A:  pushing and pushing and drooling. 
1 A:  {Talks to the cat} Quit drooling on me, look at this I'm wet.
1 A:  Fitness and exercise.
0 B:  Religiously do water aerobics,
1 it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh-, in there, uh, I tried
0 B:  So, I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it. 
0 B:  So, to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself
1 B:  Huh.  Do you know if they have child care there? 
1 A:  [Laughter] Um, have you done your attitude survey for this year yet?
0 that was pretty much in the industry [breathing], and I used to fill out
0 B:  and, uh, uh, me and the insurance adjusters are, are very familiar with
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Okay, uh, things have become much more enlightened since then.
0 A:  Could you hold the phone for one second,
0 to be working and so that we had just, you know, it was, this way we didn't
0 have to layoff an active person and we'd just let you go.  And it took me
0 me,
0 B:  I was just pissed as hell that they could do that. 
1 B:  I still don't think that, they after my experiences that they could, you
0 A:  I, I can understand.  I can understand.  Well, it's been good talking with
0 you.
1 A:  Wonderful. 
0 B:  Huh.  All righty.  When you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell?
0 A:  All righty [laughter].  Um, well, I, uh, have a four year old who will
0 involved in, uh, in what's out there and how they do things.  Um, as far as
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  uh, verses having her go down here and not learn anything, and then, uh,
0 A:  Yeah, I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people,
0 A:  and, uh, and not really get down to teaching what's important.  Teaching
1 lifting so she choice to take weight lifting,
0 A:  Yeah, then it comes down to what you said before though about them being
0 expressways a little better, that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads,
1 [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] There's an idea. 
0 B:  Surely.  I've enjoyed it. 
0 had, um, put a set of brakes on my little Blazer that we have, and fortunately
1 fluish type, and said, What a time for this to set in,
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 jacked up, and need the car the next day type deal, so --
0 B:  Get sick with the flu [laughter].
0 B:  Is expensive, uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh
0 emergency brake froze on --
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- that, that was the reason I had to replace mine,
1 to that near the brake so that if they did get hot they'd unfreeze [laughter].
1 South,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, so I guess it, it is to your advantage to either not have friends
1 like that or,
0 A:  Right.
1 don't, it'd seem like they'd just put a little barrel out there and say it
0 Rouge, and he came back out, and the car, the truck wouldn't stop, I mean, it
1 B:  -- and the only bad news was my husband would have to go to a garage and
0 pick them up, pick the bolts up for him [laughter] --
0 B:  Okay, Greg.
1 B:  Well, I have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom, but it usually's holding
1 A:  That's what I did with mine,
1 A:  for a long time, put it on the handlebars so I can hang them up.
1 A:  And sometimes she just flops them all over the seat.
0 A:  I read a book while I'm doing it.
1 A:  And my legs, you know, how, okay, I'm going to turn forty this summer, I
0 B:  Are they kind of expensive.
0 B:  Well, you can believe that anyway, right.
0 B:  #During the year.#
0 A:  Yeah.
1 running out the door, he's working at night tonight.  So I decided to do it
0 B:  #Well, that's# interesting.
1 dinner.
1 B:  Oh, my goodness [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] The other woman didn't cook too much either.  Right.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  I don't know.
1 B:  I don't either [laughter].
0 A:  Huh-uh.  Well, how'd you find out about it?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  I kept hanging up on them for days, until my husband told me what it was
1 [laughter].
0 to, I don't know, nine or ten.  How many calls have you ma-, had?
0 B:  Oh, my.  And some of the prizes are pretty nice.  
0 A:  [Talking] {voice in background: pour some charcoal in there}. 
1 A:  No, I'm trying not to.  He's telling me to start the grill. 
1 B:  Oh [laughter].
1 here that's hilarious.  It has a button you can push, if you get a call you
1 don't like then it makes machine gun noise [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, god.
1 B:  It's got one of those, and um, well, it's got a lot, I mean, pages and
0 B:  He brought it home.  
1 five seconds to say good-bye.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  (( )) I went to Metropolitan a couple of years ago, so I sit and study, I
1 I just get with another friend, and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and
1 riding around like we couldn't find the place [laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah, I do, too.  Two, a girl, one's in college, so I don't have a, have a
1 A:  So there's where the money goes.
1 A:  Uh.
0 A:  It is so hard.
0 A:  -- to buy something.  There are certain kinds I like and certain kinds I
1 because my children, when they get in the car, and I have, uh, the button
1 pushed for that, they always switch it to something else [laughter].
1 and I don't sing aloud, 
1 A:  to anybody but myself [laughter].
0 happens if you, unless you get into rock, which isn't her voice style.  So,
1 my musical tastes.
0 terribly repetitious.
0 A:  I agree with that too.
1 B:  Although now I kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll, I guess it makes me
1 think I'm young again [laughter].
0 and all that stuff.
0 B:  And, you, you don't hear everything all the time, but you hear much of the
1 B:  Um, which is always kind of funny.
0 done by maybe the Platters or something.
1 little bit.  She said, I like the original version better.  Well, they did it
1 again, about [laughter] two or three years ago, and I laughed again.  I said,
1 Oh no, here we are [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, that's nice.  So, is your husband a singer?
1 A:  Yeah, maybe so. We'll start listening to children's music [laughter].
1 B:  -- even though my children are now, my youngest is almost sixteen.
1 B:  And so she, she gets the wrong note every now and then.
0 A:  Uh, I tell my husband to sing to my stomach, because they say that babies
0 not always classical as, you know, the official, uh, word might go, but, um,
0 A:  Huh.
0 they first start listening to music on their own --
1 was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore [laughter].
1 A:  Right, yeah, have something to rebel against [laughter].
1 that when I total up the score but,
1 A:  Uh-huh.  What is your worst, then?  [Laughter].
1 strange.  I hadn't been able to get out yet, but, uh, my biggest problem is
0 been going to the driving range with him, and, and it seems to be doing some,
1 lot of things wrong at that point, but I was trying to think of so many
0 let me see how you look, so he's bending down on one knee, right, so I take a
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 or anything, I'm definitely going to [noise] {in background} you know, teach
0 B:  I think that's mine.  Let me just quick catch it and I'll be back.
0 B:  [Noise] I'm back [noise].
0 a hole in one.
0 brother-in-law, but, uh, and he, he said he got his luckily, so I don't know.
1 B:  Oh, thank God I've never been to Midland.
1 been.
0 trouble hitting the greens.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  It's a frustrating game, golf.
0 B:  Like you, I haven't played any or not much this year.  I played a couple of
0 and we, I think we've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also.
0 we see that.  In one sense, I'm an older person, in my fifties, so I feel that
1 B:  It's mostly, you know, even if you want to say home, you really can't.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  That's fine, that's, that's the freedom of choice.
0 B:  And I agree with that, because anyone who has children that doesn't really
0 B:  Well, I shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent.  They won't
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 like I didn't belong anymore.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  And I wasn't there at supper time or bed time, or they couldn't tell me
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  And, uh, I really think that if, uh, like after the second World War when
0 A:  Exactly.
0 B:  And now kids at sixteen years old, they have their birthday, what do they
1 get, they get a car.
0 B:  More than someone handing something to you.
0 esteem and the, the way you, uh, you know, think about things is probably --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Like I've had my, you know, like I know kids up here that have
0 just drop to the floor, you know.
0 B:  You know, there is no harm in that, whereas sometimes you can't even get
1 that from a kid, you know.
0 abortions and that type of thing, women in politics and --
1 A:  Uh.
0 B:  -- president someday, maybe [laughter].
0 politics, I think it will definitely be freedom of choice.
0 B:  Which I mean I think it should be anyway.
1 A:  Okay, um, do you have a credit card?
0 made me spend a little more, so when I paid one of them off, I got rid of 
0 B:  #That's really# good.
0 financially with, with them, it's, it, it's just unreal. I guess,
1 cotton dress, you got to go out and buy the rayon dress,
1 ge-, uh, have their credit card, and um, um, uh, uh, si-, half a dozen isn't
1 enough [laughter].
1 {speaker imitates her husband's voice}.
1 know, he believed in it.
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].
1 A:  You've got to have #a credit,#
0 cre-, uh, you just can't live without it, because down here they don't take a
0 take it off your credit card --
0 B:  Is it?  I, I don't know.  We, do-, uh, we don't,
1 he's never had to use it so we don't get any, get --
1 B:  -- any, get anything, uh, for it.
1 A:  Yeah.  If he, they, they, they have you pay it right out every month.
1 A:  Yeah because it's, uh,
0 A:  You can use that.  I don't know why you can't use other credit cards for
1 person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa.
1 B:  Oh, I, I, I'm sure there are.  I mean, uh,
0 A:  I think they charge more for cash advances so,  
0 B:  Do they, um, it's, it's, some cards y-, you can do that and some cards you
0 A:  Oh.
1 A:  No, it doesn't.
1 B:  An-, it's still there.
1 A:  Oh wow.
1 A:  I, I know.
1 A:  Should own stock.
0 like that, because, uh, boy I know.  People who ki-, people right out of
0 B:  Yeah.
1 doing, are the spending ones.  But I haven't heard o-, uh, a single woman
1 taking their credit card away from the man [laughter].
1 A:  And just as soon as I get it paid off I'll probably get laid off.
1 A:  Well, we don't do much eating out.
1 last place you went out to eat?
1 find a (( )), and I said it's the toy, uh, uh, the play yard out in the front
0 yard [laughter] that McDonald's has.
0 You know, they had airplanes that go up and down and stuff,
0 and you know it was, um, I'll date myself a little bit, but it's remarkable
0 A:  Well, we went one time, uh, one of my ex boyfriends had taken me.  This was
1 A:  -- and it was the nastiest tasting pizza,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  I've ever tasted [laughter].
0 B:  Huh.
1 then they learned to say no.
0 B:  Right.
1 A:  -- you know, and my son, I can't describe him, it's, I don't know, why, or
1 [laughter] you know. I can't relate to a seventeen year old yet.
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 since nineteen sixty-five, that's been a long time ago.  I lived several
1 A:  Air Force, uh, I, he tried to get in there.  They wouldn't take him
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Well, uh, I was born in sixty-five, so I can't say that.  My husband was
0 uniform when you were off duty.  But I didn't, I flew into Los Angeles, but I
1 B:  Well, um, we lived, I grew up in San Antonio, and I was used to the heat,
0 about anything you want to grow --
1 we've been uh, planting flowers that we could never plant,
0 B:  in San Antonio because the heat would just dry them up after, you know,
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 here just around us.
0 B:  Yeah, we're getting replenished, and so there is, when I first came here
0 B:  But, uh, that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening,
1 and that's about the extent of what we've done, just a little bit on the
0 A:  So, but we don't, the St. Augustine and all that supposedly was back there
0 just wasn't, like I say, there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the
0 A:  And, um, so mostly, you know, we're not even to the point where we're
1 A:  and flower beds or even gardens, that, we're just saying, let's get some
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  And [child] trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground
1 we're going to have to let the back yard die.
1 to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out.
0 A:  It's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful,
0 A:  And, um,
0 B:  Yeah, I imagine [child].  So, well everybody, it seems like everyone is so
1 was the first one, too.  And we had no idea the expense that lawns and
0 those in, that was, that was the only way to go because it was just so
1 th-, the sprinkler around everywhere.
1 are just so tall and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so
0 that like even if its raining, you can [laughter] go out in our back yard and
0 B:  Oh, but that's so neat, because so many homes don't have that.  So you'll
1 us, they built a new house on the empty lot and they just had their brand new
0 A:  Well, there are all different kinds.
0 B:  Yeah, anyway, but now it looks like, uh, Kuwait has asked us to defend its
0 borders.
0 don't believe in the same things and don't live the same way that you do, you
0 them of all their troubles, and how can you get across to the people that
0 person of empty promises.  You can't, you know.  It's hard, it's hard to do
0 anything, if he, if he gets stability and he doesn't, you know, get knocked
0 of demarcation, don't they call it, and they've already outlined that for the
1 cease fire.  And uh, apparently we don't want to deal with that, but the
0 A:  So there's already some trouble brewing.
0 B:  Anyway, so it's,
0 against them.  Like, you know, that's why the Palestinians were, were rooting
0 --
0 got some more, he'd try again and get some more.
0 seems like he's as bad as Hitler, almost, by the way he, you know, they
0 they're third world countries.  They are like, their people are in bad shape.
0 B:  They keep saying they think he won't make it, but it looks like he's, you
0 know, it's just a matter if he can survive --
0 B:  -- you know, without somebody else, you know a coup attempt or something.
0 before I leave for work.  And then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be
0 find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because
0 I used to get it during the week --
1 always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time,
0 B:  So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work.  Um, the
0 a very different slant on the news.
0 amount of time.  Sort of like the, uh, what is that, A B C's NIGHTLINE.
0 A:  They don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in, in every
1 editorial cartoons about all the retired generals,
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Although, um {pause}.  I-, I'm only twenty-five, so I've never actually
0 background knowledge in, uh, military strategy and, and weaponry, and, and all
0 A:  and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on.  But I thought
0 B:  I will admit it's interesting.  I-, I-, I'm twenty-six.  So I don't have
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah.
0 was seeing.
0 got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the TIMES HERALD, and then
0 the MORNING NEWS, which has a very strong subscription.
1 A:  and I enjoy, the comics are better in this newspaper.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers.  He takes both San Antonio
0 B:  At the present time we have none.  We intend to purchase a pup in two
1 B:  No, we've got, uh, we've been married forever --
1 A:  Oh [laughter].
0 had kids.  That's why I thought when you were saying, you know, we're going to
1 have one in two months, or something, perhaps that you were newly married
0 A:  That's what, that's what we have is two dogs. 
0 A:  And he's been, it was alright, before we had our kids, it was, he's just,
0 B:  Goodness.
1 {whispering}, he weighs about forty pounds.  And then Pepper is a year younger
0 A:  Absolutely.  I never wanted, my husband wanted indoor dogs, because he'd
1 B:  And the scratches, #and the smell, and the, uh, wherever, yeah.#
0 B:  And, um, and we had our Danes in the house.
1 A:  Oh my goodness.
1 wound up getting uh, getting rid of the mom, selling the puppy and just
0 B:  Yeah.
1 about ten or eleven, I guess, my parents decided that dogs would be a good way
1 next to last litter, we kept, we had one, one we never could get rid of.  He
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 there were four of them that survived.
0 A:  Oh she didn't.
0 B:  No, she didn't even, she did not even take the sa-.  This is the laziest
1 A:  That was like, oh boy, they are so messy when they're little, too
1 [laughter].
0 And I had a few, until,
0 to have these, um, this was a box, and it was originally, it was made like an
1 A:  -- that you could get water out of it, you know, keep cold water.
1 if I didn't keep the lid on it the fish would, uh, swim out and flop on the
0 A:  Yeah.  Those have been, I mean, and our dogs, now our dogs, with our kids,
0 some of the, uh, responsibilities.  A three and a half year old,
0 B:  take part of many of the responsibilities.  Maybe feeding them.
1 wants to poke.  My older one, our older son's pretty good about it.  He'll pet
1 B:  kids trying to figure out, you know, what's going to happen, and it will
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  I think, when they're really little, like the eighteen month old, it's not
1 B:  But we, uh, 
1 B:  What kinds of things have you done?
0 A:  Um, well, I've made a lot of baby gifts [laughter].  
1 B:  Do you ever keep any of your stuff?
0 B:  I do crochet and a lot of, uh, things like that, and I have very little of
1 B:  Oh well, can you do it (( ))?
0 B:  Was, was the whole face done or just the numbers, and, and, like minute
0 minute marks are done, they're like hearts.
0 B:  Oh.
0 colonial times to, uh, uh, to upholster chairs, and so forth, as well as the
1 A:  Yeah,
1 B:  Me, too.
0 make them, they like.  I don't know how to explain it.  They make them hard,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 questions, but she has three kids all under the age of like six.
0 Victorian type --
1 would, how they would last.
1 B:  Do you know what my concern is?  How will I dust this thing?  [laughter].
1 A:  No that's true.  That's funny.
0 it, because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth, but it's
1 such a dust collector to be out, and so forth.
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].
0 A:  I know.
1 B:  So first thing I think of is how easy would this,
1 B:  Oh, you don't have time.
1 B:  And so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all.
1 swore I was going to finish for somebody for Christmas.
0 demands my tim-, my, my total attention.
1 even starting it, because I have a feeling I'm never going to get it done.
0 A:  No, that's true.  I, I just don't know when I'm ever, it just seems like
1 really hard.  But I really do en-, like I said I really enjoy it when I do.
0 A:  And then I buy the bibs separate.  Usually I think it's a little bit
1 A:  There's yeah, there's a few designs I guess I've done myself, but not very
1 was just the ink, and then I made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth.
1 A:  Have you had any, uh, major, uh, car repairs done recently?
1 how much they,
0 A:  Uh, I work on my own.  I've got an nineteen eighty Trans Am that I've had,
1 replace the water pump back in nineteen eighty-three.
1 B:  I don't think that's the kind of thing you can do yourself, is it?
1 signal fixed.  But, uh, other than that, for passing inspection, uh, they gave
1 me a shopping list of things I needed to get done [laughter].
1 A:  I never did get it fixed.
0 B:  Yeah, somebody said that, um, that, uh, there mus-, there's probably some
0 B:  So it's just one of those weird things.  I mean, he was willin-, he said,
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  I  won't buy a Dodge.
0 B:  Oh, really.  Holy mackerel.
1 A:  Nothing but problems with it.  So he finally traded it in and actually
1 bought a Ford Escort [laughter].
0 start first time every time.
0 buys a Lexis.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Right.
1 B:  He doesn't really have anything else to spend his money on [laughter].
0 have a hard time justifying spending that kind of money on any car.
1 B:  -- to get his oil changed.  I'm going, I don't think that's worth it
0 time, many years ago for an oil change at the dealer and they charged me
0 B:  What?
0 all.
0 B:  Oh yeah.  I'd prefer to do it, but the Escort was very difficult for me to
0 get under, and I didn't want to put it up on ramps or anything --
0 A:  Right.
1 A:  Oh yeah.
0 A:  But, it wasn't a real problem.
0 hassle.  I think that if I had been nicer to my Escort and been more diligent
0 going to keep it.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Uh, I get offers [laughter] every now and then from,
0 B:  Right, right.  Well I bet you, I bet, I mean if it's in good condition and
0 A:  A new car?
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Oh, I'm no-, I don't think I'm in the new car market [laughter].
0 necessity in business and so forth, I, I try to refrain from their use as much
0 B:  Plus it, uh, has, you know, from an economic point of view it has increased
0 A:  Well, we, uh, me and my wife, when, when we have like extra money that we
1 something cents interest,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  But, uh, for hotels and, and so forth.  But, uh, but I knew that it was
1 A:  Right.  That's good.  I've, I don't think we've gone that far (( ))
1 [laughter],
0 B:  -- for hotel bills and so forth.
0 B:  Plus I would, uh, when they, uh, would send the bill, they would
0 changed drastically.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 drastically.  And whe-, when I finally got over there, it had fallen, uh, two
0 A:  Right.
1 A:  Right. Yeah especially, 
0 know, lavishly, in that regard.
0 B:  So you're from Dal-, okay, I'm from Maryland.
1 A:  Oh really.  
0 A:  Wow.  Do you work for T I?
1 very exact.
0 A:  Right.  I work in (( )).
0 B:  Oh, really?
1 B:  I guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the
1 recording [laughter].
0 B:  Alright. Okay, fine.  Well, you have a good evening.
1 an American made car.  Even though sometimes the foreign cars are better, but
1 out of jobs as it is.  So I'd probably buy, I've always own American car.  Uh,
0 Continental, the Lincoln Continental.
0 A:  Yes, it's a matter of time.  It's probably going to be another two to five
0 B:  Yes.  She finally, she wo-, she had a, she's got a Honda, not a Honda, a
0 B:  #But, it,# I think what it is, the American public had made good cars at one
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 regular Taurus I think is twelve or thirteen.
0 A:  Well that's not too bad in price.
0 A:  Um.  Their durability is a lot better, I understand, than most other vans.
0 A:  Right.
1 B:  You know, in, in Germany it would probably be alright if you put it on that
1 Autobahn [laughter].  But over here, nobody should be going that fast to be
0 someone off the phone}.  Excuse me for a moment. {On phone}.  Right, I'm
0 fixing to get them right now. {Off phone again}.  Excuse me, I had to, uh,
0 B:  Oh right.
1 B:  Boy, you're, you're right up there about where I am.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  So you find yourself --
0 B:  Well, I'm, I'm getting better about hitting them straight, but where I get
0 A:  Oh.
0 A:  Well, we speak of the three games of golf here.  
0 B:  Yes.
0 A:  So.
0 down the middle he usually wins about a quarter a hole because they've been in
1 way.  All of us young bucks get out there and hit the ball,

0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 year to belong to a club,
1 B:  There's a few of those here, too.
0 B:  I mean, I've, I tend to stay pretty busy at my job --
1 B:  -- and it's hard to get on a regular schedule.  And then we're pretty
0 A:  Uh-huh.  And you probably have children at home which takes up a lot more
1 B:  We have two miniature dachshunds and ten fish.
0 about the only two really cold months --
0 B:  -- that we had.  It was up in the very warm temperatures even in December
0 town a lot of people go to Arizona or Florida for the winter, and they're able
1 @B:  Well, it is, it is, but, uh, in a way, and in a way it isn't.  Uh, our
0 A:  And use the U N as it was set up to be.
1 Schm-, I can't pronounce his name.  I give up.  The general.  Stormin Norman
1 [laughter].
0 B:  Oh yes,
0 before.  But I think, uh, that, I really think that we should let the U N take
1 B:  No, like I said.  That should be the job of the U N, not the United States
0 need is guidance and how to handle their civil wars and their, uh, their
0 A:  And I mean, the countries ahead of, ahead of us that the babies live longer
0 and are more healthy are rather embarrassing.  I mean there are some countries
0 A:  And, and I've found,
0 B:  Uh, yes.
0 A:  I couldn't live on two hundred and thirty dollars a month.
0 A:  I can't, with my family, and I have a small family.
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah.
0 to cash them in.
0 A:  Well Dallas politics are rather strange, you know.
0 B:  Um, yeah.
0 A:  Anywhere they're stran-, down here they're strange.  I can imagine from an
1 outsider's point of view.
0 get, but that is kind of sad that when, when the focus is more on the other
1 A:  Well now that we've solved the problems of the world.
0 that, but they say --
0 A:  -- you shouldn't do that any more but, um,
1 A:  Oh yeah.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 Usually I just leave a faucet dripping in a bowl in the kitchen.  And I've
0 don't smell as bad [laughter].
1 B:  Well (( )) if you don't keep them clean.  My friend had gerbils and you
0 something that, um, I had to like learn to --
0 their little cage --
0 grew up having dogs, and I would like to have a dog, but kind of like for the
0 leave a cat.
0 lot more expensive to get.  Now my cat, I've had her for eight or nine years.
0 whenever I've had a dog, you know, something always, they're always getting
1 B:  Yeah, that, yeah, I don't know if that's such a big problem here in Dallas.
1 A:  That's true.  They are a lot, I guess that's the number one reason why I'm
0 B:  Yeah.
0 and --
0 A:  A long time.
1 them, and how to, you know, to clean them.  You know, the thought of cleaning
0 A:  -- and you, supposedly you don't have to change all of the, the bedding and
1 A:  Oh no.
1 B:  (( )) [laughter].
1 B:  But you don't really know?
1 A:  I guess we won't know unless they never have any babies [laughter].
1 A:  Well, you know, the people that sold them go, well, it's hard to tell, but
1 we think {speaking as the sellers did} [laughter],
0 B:  [Laughter] That's funny.
0 B:  Okay, well it was nice talking to you.
0 A:  Do you have, 
0 A:  -- um, clone. It's not the T I P C --
0 thing at work.  I have a three eighty-six S X which is T I computer, but
0 A:  but I work at home.
0 B:  I was amazed when I took our taxes to our tax person and she works out of
0 personal things.  We di-, for us it really took, you know, a business
0 application --
0 B:  Oh, definitely, definitely.  I know my stepfather bought my mother a little
0 don't think she's ever touched it --
1 home.  You know, she always seems to have better things to do than to try to

0 envelopes with the windows in the right places --
0 over there, and, and he paid his monthly bills, and he just, you know, wrote
0 B:  -- and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes and there they

0 A:  I mean, it was like a necessity.
1 A:  Yeah, any more I don't even know if they have, if a college kid would have
0 A:  I mean, and then of course you have some changes to make, and do the whole
0 B:  Well, we'll try this out and see what it looks like.  Yeah.
0 letters am I retyping for whatever reason.
0 A:  Right,
0 be able to play with it.  So.  I know, my father had a P C, and when we were

0 quoted statistics that I just about, my throat just about fell into my toes.
1 usually those people that go into education.

0 A:  #right now# if you ask my friends t-, put twenty mothers in a room and ask
1 A:  Oh, no.  #Nobody has, nobody has a nongifted child.#

0 A:  But our black cat has never, never once been outside and has no interest in
0 B:  Yeah, most, mine generally stay in the windows.

0 A:  No, not if they've never been out in any ((weather)),
0 B:  And I suspect somebody had just had him and moved on.
0 B:  It's sad.
0 B:  Strange mixture.  He was, uh, the best I can figure, he was part Lab
0 B:  Had the bloodhound mouth --
1 B:  And so after she had chewed up my, my redwood furniture --
0 A:  Yes, I've seen that.
0 A:  I bet she did.
0 B:  She'd grab that thing in the middle,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  and she'd drag that thing around the yard.
0 our new family is the, you know, our two cats and our dog.  We never really,
0 A:  They keep you entertained.  They sure do.
1 and bring the dog.  I think she's more happy to see the dog than she is us.
1 Kisses, you know?
0 A:  You really shouldn't feed chocolate to a dog.
1 A:  So I kind of have to watch her,
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  I guess so, yeah.
0 B:  Well, of course, Da-, and Dachshunds like chocolate.
0 A:  Yeah, they love it.  They really do.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Like, you know, what are you, a fool,
0 A:  That's right [laughter].
0 B:  I just, I usually --
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  But then I also have department stores,
0 department stores, I guess.
0 A:  Just your Visa, yeah.
0 sure is hard to get it --
0 of fact,
0 A:  #That's good.#
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  So you haven't been tempted ((uh)) to, to call any of these nine hundred
0 B:  you know, and you can get your gold Visa card or gold MasterCard.
0 can,
0 B:  Well, then they, sure they won't turn you down,
1 A:  #Sure, they've got your money already.#
1 B:  Yeah.  But that's, yeah, I know that's the way some of them work, anyway.
1 B:  Right.
1 seem to have cash.
0 A:  #for gas,# but other than that, it's, it's a good deal, I think.
0 B:  Yeah, but they're, of course now they're beginning to, to get the picture,
1 price back to the cash price or raised all their prices,
0 B:  #up to the charge price.#
0 there we usually fly.
0 B:  You know, you can fly just about as cheap as you can drive.
0 B:  Okay.  It's nice talking to you.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 The, the, whole goal of the Marxist, Leninist theology is world domination.
0 A:  -- and all this, and so no, I don't trust them a bit.  I think it's a big
0 B:  Think so?
0 him off.
0 B:  Their people are starving.
0 A:  But when you, anytime you see a (( )) go in and just overtake it, and it's
0 A:  -- it's a, I believe it's a spiritual thing that happens and it's like a
0 a lot, too, I know.  It's not necessarily, I don't think this is the greatest
0 A:  theology.  They deny God, they deny any creator.  They've forbade
0 B:  Yeah.
1 and so they're preparing for the trip, you know, and, and it was, I sat behind
1 oh, that's cool.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  I don't know.  I just, I think they want a one world order, that's what I
1 B:  Yes.
0 B:  Oh, yes, oh, yes,
0 B:  ca-, that, that, we need to take real advantage,
0 B:  -- to, to pull their satellites away from them.
0 I think, I mean just look what we did to Iraq, I mean,
0 A:  but I still believe they've, uh, they've probably got weapons we ca-, I
1 A:  I wouldn't be surprised if Gorbachev wasn't a s-, wasn't a satanist.  I'm
0 A:  Exactly.  Even, you know, in our own country, I mean, Bush was in the scull
0 him,
1 B:  {Background music}.
1 A:  You'd be crazy if you trust them, but anyway, call it, what is it,
0 we've not done near the atrocities they've done.  And we need to maybe do that
0 B:  ((Uh-huh)).
1 A:  I'm not saying that either, but that's not what the question asked so
1 [laughter],
0 B:  No.
1 B:  Uh, I don't know.
0 A:  Well, I didn't get, uh, [talking] {in background} into football until 
0 A:  Uh,
0 B:  The Broncos, oh, yuck, I hate them.
0 B:  So who do you think's going to win this year?
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, I can't remember his name either.
1 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh, shoot, I can't even think who's quarter-, uh, the, uh, darn, uh, coach
0 B:  Yeah, that's it.
1 A:  The what?
0 A:  Now, who, who was this?
1 A:  Oh, okay.
0 goes walking up to Mike Ditka to talk to him and Mike Ditka just turns his
0 back on him and walks away.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 tail with her foot and said, you know, pointed that finger and ((went))
0 A:  Yeah, well, it didn't hurt and she was more, you know, we was in a, uh, it
0 B:  Huh.
0 A:  I'm trying to think where we were.  I don't remember where we were.
0 A:  World League?
0 combined.
0 A:  Yeah, well, well, uh, that's how I got to liking Doug Flutie.  He was
0 remember their names.
0 A:  Put it in my head and kept it there.  But, uh, I don't know.
0 A:  Yeah, well, I, that, the London Knights, I think, is who it is.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 mean.
0 A:  So I guess they would take it serious.  I, I never thought of it like that.
1 A:  That's a good come back, thank you.
1 B:  All right [laughter].
0 B:  Kickers?  Huh, I don't know, I hadn't thought too much about that.  I
1 B:  My da-, both my mom and dad went to Penn State so,
1 B:  Huh.
0 involved?
0 B:  Well, well, speaking of that kind of issue, have you kept up with John
0 B:  I agree with you but did you see the map they drew up on, uh, on how they
0 B:  Yeah.  You can disagree with, uh, what they're doing and what they're
0 @@B:  I, I have got to run to a meeting.
0 B:  It was good talking to you.  I don't think we've gone our, our ten minutes
0 but I think we've, we've talked long enough.
0 A:  Okay.  Good talking to you.
1 A:  [Children] Yeah, uh, well, yeah, living in Texas especially I see it
0 B:  Well, it's not just that.  Are there enough jobs for people here now?
0 A:  Yeah, from everywhere, too, not just from Mexico, you know,
1 do as they wish, when they wish.
0 know, thinking that they're going to have money and jobs and success and
1 above middle class incomes, whatever that is in the United States now.
1 B:  Well, yeah, you work for T I.
0 A:  Well,
1 B:  Huh, none of us would.
0 A:  [Noise] {cracking}.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  But then you know, too, on a, it's, uh, of course, what I
0 B:  Yeah, you can't stop them, and once they're here, to some extent we support
0 to hire illegal aliens and all this, and whether that's working or not I don't
1 illegal.
0 B:  It is in Texas, too.
0 B:  Yes.
1 B:  Well,
0 B:  Yes.  And I don't hold it against the people.
0 signs saying, I'll work for a meal, but I'll bet you if you stopped and you
1 B:  Or, now that's not true of all of them.  There are,
0 and times are hard, not everyone's that way.  You know, good people are being
1 A:  I don't know, I haven't heard any-, I don't hear much about Colorado
1 Springs.  It's kind of like they're kind of trying to be invisible, [laughter]
0 B:  Yeah, so you're in division what now?
0 A:  division nine.
0 A:  so wha-, what's your favorite exercise?
1 because I'm, I'm too old for it now.
0 B:  Uh, this last tournament I was in I walked nine holes and almost dropped
1 so,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 what they do at lunch time.  They go out and run around the building.
0 A:  Yeah, I just sort of hated it from that point on.  Well,
1 B:  Yeah, but, uh,  
0 good ankle brace I'm going to start playing some racquetball again, but --
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  I'm tired of running around on crutches for two months at a time.
0 B:  [Laughter] Huh.
0 A:  Um, trouble is I can't get them tight enough --
0 B:  Tight enough to really support your ankle?
1 A:  Well, I guess that's about it for exercise.
1 A:  Well, that's, that's good exercise, and I don't do enough of that either.
0 B:  Yeah, cheese is bad for you, I know but,
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, I heard about it.
0 overweight and I smoke, but my blood pressure is about, my last reading was
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Jeez, I'm not worried about it [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, exactly.  And, and, and even then you've got to watch the bread and
1 B:  Yeah, it would have to be a diet bread.
1 A:  Yeah.  You never know what's in the water, either [laughter].
0 A: #And that's# the way you're going to dedicate yourself to, to that,
1 what am I going to do,
0 you know, the volunteers to do that.  And maybe they could, uh, spend a little
0 A:  Well, the-, I don't think there's any way it can, you know, like they say
1 all, I've never heard of it until this, this phone call, you know.
0 B:  Right [laughter].
1 you, crazy?  I mean, ther-, --
0 a prominent, uh, predominant re-, uh, religion.  So I know, I don't think
0 A:  And so if your number is below four hundred, you're not going to have to do
0 B:  I see.
0 depending how many people are in your class, and, you know, and like you, the,
0 B:  Right.
1 physical training,
1 A:  and then he got to serve all these people.
1 sorry, I don't get paid, you know?
1 A:  ((It's like)) please let me ride for free.
0 my B S, you know, it's like, by the time,
0 read the newspaper that much, but I never heard anything about it, so,
1 A:  And, but then you won't have to do it. 
1 A:  Just imagine sometimes your kids, you'll be saying, well, it's your job, go
0 B:  That's right [laughter].  It's easier after you, you don't have to worry
1 A:  Yeah, really.  Then you'll have to say, ((see in my age)), I didn't have to
1 A:  (( )) yeah,
0 students, uh, that were non,
1 @A:  W-, we're on finances, have you, have you retired or, uh,
0 of finances, it is tough.  Uh, I've been with T I, I'm just going to be
0 than, I, I don't have a budget.  That's one of my goals for this year is to
1 A:  Well, you, you, you deserve an honor for that, a gold star for that, I
1 guess [laughter].
1 A:  and I said, I've been a happy man since I haven't,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  fooled with that checkbook, you know [laughter].
0 problem in our marriage.  What I have always identified is I am basically good
1 B:  think that comes from never having enough.  You know, I'm always afraid
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  Uh, band.  She got, you know, five hundred dollars at a, at a clip through
0 B:  Oh, goodness.
0 A:  Right, uh,
0 B:  What, what I did is I was approached and, and I've, I went to T I just
0 C U.
0 A:  Yes.  So --
0 B:  Well, I like Mike Ditka.
0 B:  Yeah, I was kind of, I was, I was disappointed.  They came along pretty
0 B:  Tomczak was, was trying hard, but he just can't do it.
0 Walsh.
0 with a longterm six year contract and they were paying,
1 B:  You still got them?
0 we go a little bit further than that, uh, [swallowing] and I, uh, uh, I was
0 A:  which is now the Kansas City Chiefs, and I, and I may have been the only
0 L, uh, when, when the Chiefs, when the Texans were playing, they would give
0 the scores of the Cowboy games and the N F L games, but the N F L refused to
0 B:  [Cough].
1 and fifty dollar bonds and thousand dollar bonds that you had to buy
1 if)) that guy that's in the eleventh row, see, he bought thousand dollar bonds
1 fine, take them.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  But, uh, the, the funny thing about the Cowboys is, is that everybody is
0 A:  Yeah, well, I heard Jerry Jones say something interesting and I, and I, it
0 A:  No, no, no, but, but, you know, that's where Bob Hayes was in his early
0 Dallas in, of course, I worked for T I, too,
1 B:  -- that it just kind of turned me against them.
0 in the last second or two.  But, uh, I mean, in the seventies it was play-offs
1 and stuff.  And then everybody would wander into the stadium, you know.
0 B:  Is it that much (( ))?
0 A:  that's a hundred and sixteen dollars,
0 get more seniority on earth --
0 less, taken on from each side.  Because they're getting it from, like Turkey
1 A:  uh,
1 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- unless the people have proof that they're leaving --
0 B:  No, that would solve our own problems.  I don't know, I think the war was
0 A:  A lot of their, their civil problems where they've got their, uh, Baltic
0 A:  -- where, where ethnic groups were split up and, and our, and don't
1 @@A:  So, well, I think we've taken up at least five minutes.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 me.  And what happens if it, you know, if it, if they catch it, they think
0 be set up to avoid that.  For example, that one, uh, positive would not be,
0 circumstances, that could come up with, with, uh, false positives for certain
0 A:  drugs.  I mean --
0 next to you --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 taking drugs.
0 know of a number of other people who have, you know, gotten all messed up.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Most of these are young people.  I work in the education system and so I
0 this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking --
0 thinking that, you know, he, he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide
0 makes me realize what it could do to people, you know, in the work force as
0 well.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Pard-, yes, right,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  There are lots of things that are involved there, um, such as, perhaps,
0 need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination --
0 B:  Yeah.  I don't,
1 B:  would be some measure of protection.  But the bottom line is that, that
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  I think we, I think we did pretty good.
0 B:  Well, I'm sort of an exercise fanatic.  I'm big on swimming.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Wow.
1 B:  Well, it winds up being a little stress on the shoulder joints after a
1 while [laughter].
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  It's Olympic size, yes.
1 A:  What,
1 B:  which is, which is another Dallas company [laughter].
0 B:  Huh.
0 get home, that's it, you know.
1 know, all the nautilus machines and all that sort of stuff.  We're not, we're
1 B:  Huh.  Well, I get to put work after work.  I, I have to,
1 B:  Huh.
1 A:  Aerobics you don't forget [laughter].
1 A:  It's a, it's a lot quicker and, and that way it's completely low impact.
0 A:  Yeah, we have one of those, too, but it's boring.
1 that that's, uh, boring.
0 B:  while I'm swimming.  So I, I can write letters to congressman and,
0 you sometimes have to force yourself until you get started?
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  It seems like, [clicking] like the, the, the less you exercise, the tireder
0 morning, uh, I get an urge to go back and swim again at lunch time.
1 jumping in, swimming some sprints or something like that, and then running
1 back again [laughter].
1 A:  But.
1 B:  Well, I've, I've lost most of my hair so that's no real problem [laughter].
1 B:  Then nobody really complains if I, uh, if I come in sort of half wet.
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  -- and, uh, she, she twisted,
0 B:  She did water skiing when she was, uh, young.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  And the other two got jealous and they went out and says, well, I'm going
1 to go and do it, too, so [laughter],
1 B:  So they learned, too.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- [Swallowing] and got started, and so she grabbed me by the ear and made
1 me do it this year.
0 A:  Really.
1 A:  (( )).
0 A:  Yeah, well, I don't know, I told my husband, I said, you go out some to
0 work on the car, it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at
1 each other when it goes wrong.  I says, you go pay to have someone do it.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah, yeah.
1 B:  Yeah, I had, I had a cousin that was stationed there, Plattsburgh for a
1 us, I really don't.
0 A:  When they start getting rid of technicians,
1 A:  But I didn't want to go to Texas.
0 A:  Well, interesting thing that I do is with, gardening, uh, my sister grows
0 B:  It's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it but, 
0 B:  Yeah, I didn't realize what it was for a while.  I'd walk into a room where
1 some of that, and I'd wonder what is that,
1 A:  Yeah, it is.
1 A:  Yeah, it, it looks really po-, potent stuff.
1 it, but I don't, I, I'm so, uh, timid when it comes to starting a business.
1 end.  You know, after a while you make some stuff, then you start looking at
1 it, go, boy, this, this is kind of ugly [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  So, yeah,
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  and plus it's keeping his marriage [laughter],
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah.
0 hard work.  I couldn't imagine taking lumber, raw lumber and trying to make
1 B:  Oh, man, yeah.
1 we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties --
1 A:  Is it going to be,
1 B:  -- all the shrubs and,
0 B:  ((Yeah)).
1 A:  She's got like, just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and ((mulch))
1 way that, I like the way that idea of the south is, but when I think of Texas,
1 A:  Well, where is it, is it Hous-, ((wasn't)) it Houston's humid?
0 B:  Or that accomplish what they set out to com-, to accomplish.  What are your
1 my lips.
0 A: in some other part of the world or some such thing,
0 we're going to receive, uh, eight billion dollars from Japan for the, uh,
1 it was the airlines then it was banks and, and, uh, um, savings association,
0 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  and whatnot. 
0 controlled.  But, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 uh, holidays as the, uh,
1 B:  Uh, me I'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Oh, uh-huh.  Well, that's my problem too.  I'm, I'm trying to figure out
1 going to get paid.
1 A:  -- pretty regularly and read the paper and all but when, uh, lately, like
1 the last week or two I guess with Easter [laughter],
0 debate or whatever you want to call it that, uh, voted on whether there was
1 B:  -- it could just, they could take off at any moment without, uh, you know,
1 A:  And it was really, what I felt was kind of cynical because it there just
1 hasn't been any peace over there ever [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.
0 ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation
0 B:  Yeah.  The thing, uh, the other thing too, when this all started if you,
0 of Kuwait was just, you know, somebody's [noise] uh, you go back to World War
0 just suddenly popped up.
0 [noise].  Now, something that I [breathing] read in the paper the other day
0 B:  Which is why for centuries or hundreds of years the British and the French
0 A:  And I just would prefer that, I mean sometimes we've said let's keep, we're
0 armaments.
0 A:  stay over there because we just don't want to send our people there and
0 in the back of our minds.  We,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And whether the, the United Nations, I don't think the U. S.  will do it on
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  No.  No,   
0 A:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  No. 
0 B:  that's fun. 
0 A:  I see.  Do you have a garden? 
1 B:  Oh, I see.  
0 A:  That's right.  
0 B:  but, uh,
0 B:  I said, I sometimes I wish I had more space --
0 B:  #like that.# 
0 B:  the place, don't they,
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  and keep them watered and I, I don't think I'll do it again [laughter].
0 B:  and I push them on swing. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah, you can have it come on just early in the morning.
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  I'll have to admit I don't, I do my own yard.  I, I really don't enjoy
0 A:  I had a lawn service to do my yard for me --
1 A:  -- during the real hot summer months, you know, until I retired and now I,
1 I've lost my excuse for that so I have to [laughter],
0 A:  It is kind of expensive, it is. 
0 I really don-, you know, don't,
0 A:  Absolutely.  They really go through it,
1 A:  they really do.  
0 A:  You know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too.
0 shape, so I got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just
0 B:  Well, the good stuff. 
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Right. 
0 A:  -- and, uh, I've got carrots, I mea-, yes, I've got a few carrots up and
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  they were.  
0 A:  makes a colorful salad too. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Yellow peppers, huh. 
0 B:  Some beet, uh, potatoes 
0 A:   Yeah.
0 B:  -- uh, pickler cucumbers and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our
1 A:  I don't know unless it,
0 B:  I guess.  
0 B:  Well. 
0 A:  I got my first one.  I've been at T I forever and I found an engineer
0 B:  Ninety-nine, ((I mean)) or som-,
0 B:  My goodness ((gracious)) [beep].
0 A:  Well, now,
0 because it's the slickest machine you've ever seen.
0 A:  I'll be darn [breathing].  When I, uh, I'm in, uh, Plano, right now but,
1 A:  gone, thank heaven.
1 B:  [Laughter] Well, you're not supposed to admit that [laughter].
0 A:  it was fun ((leave)).
0 A:  no such thing.  I mean --
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  You know I don't really know.  I knew,
0 B:  And then, then, then if my parents have the same kind of computer, which
1 A:  Get out of here.
0 A:  I'm familiar with Commodore.
0 A:  Oh, I see.
0 main frame.
0 was sitting there and I was pushing another floppy into this little slot, uh,
0 A:  So your kids were having a good time and you were working?
0 A:  That's marvelous.  
0 work?
0 B:  look at the Amiga, a lot of people think it's a toy and a game machine
0 A:  -- and I sit in on all this stuff.
0 output that you can get on the machine, put it right out to a, uh, vi-, video
0 tape and just cut you a video tape by, uh, by running it,
0 be put right out of the back of the machine to a common V C R and recorded on
0 running.
0 satisfactory done, you can then take it and play it back out of the machine
0 A:  whole operation.   
0 B:  Okay.  Well, 
0 hundred dollars and that's made by a commercial company just for the Amiga.  I
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Oh, yeah, 
1 A:  well, you eat them dead but,
1 A:  don't eat it.  But, um, you just put some Cajun, well, lots of pepper
0 them too?
1 probably, um, sh-, shell them or at least disconnect them from the head
1 A:  there's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head.  So, um --
0 B:  Sure.  
0 the subject of crawfish, lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like

1 B:  try to be, 
0 B:  or, uh, it was a lot of fun, you know it's something unique, you know,
1 B:  -- or, um, sometimes it would be, uh, [smack] oh, I don't know, maybe an
1 outback or something.
0 A:  Well, that's, you know, that's fun.
1 ridiculous,
1 B:  and terrible just, just to, um, make sure that they didn't have to do it
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Maybe,

0 B:  Well, that's nice.
1 she cooks everything with alcohol but [laughter],
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.  It's, um, it's in the other room I don't know,
0 B:  Sure.
1 because,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  I hope to have lots of dinner parties [laughter]. 
0 company and I know that my future husband will be, you know, he's going to be
1 B:  -- meet friends, invite, invite the boss over and,
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  Have to impress the boss [laughter] --
1 A:  and all the little bitty things that I didn't even know, 
1 been doing a lot of things wrong I didn't know about.
1 interesting information about crawfish.  I'm (( )) in fact,
1 B:  I do all my own maintenance, as a matter of fact I just finished putting a
1 A:  Wow.   
0 on a vehicle,
0 A:  Boy I'll tell you, I just got my car back from a dealer, and when it was in
0 dollars.
0 B:  Oh, sure, sure.  The, the price is astronomical, but what I do is,
1 A:  How many miles ((has it got)),  
0 B:  And it, it drives from the crankshaft, it drives, uh, a chain that drives
1 Saturday, and, I just put it in, in the garage and worked on, I, I have I new
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah.   
0 find anybody here that's willing to do that type of work.
0 B:  -- anymore, so, you know, your, your, your, your almost tied to the dealer
0 A:  -- gosh and then I went to,
0 A:  you have to remove the dash, and the fuse box to get to the motor --
1 A:  Yeah, so it's terribly engineered [laughter]. 
0 fortunate with the older cars, we can work on ((them, what, uh,)) --
0 antenna's there, you know, the antenna, the replacements parts,
0 B:  Sure.
0 A:  all that kind of thing.  But when it came to ever giving any kind of tune
0 not a big deal.
0 A:  Well that's good.
0 B:  And they really, really, they come down and pound you real hard if they
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 where I could)) trade my car off every two years.
0 with the company so, [breathing] uh, I'm a senior engineer for them, so,
1 to talk with you folks from, from down in the the main office area,
0 B:  yeah sure, how's your weather?  It's pretty good?   
1 B:  Okay sir, thank you again.  
0 to re-, retire.  And when we retire we're going to buy us, a, you know, a new
1 buy a van.  Or we're going to buy an economy car, how do you like that
0 B:  Well, have you been listening to ((Iacocca's)) arguments that, uh, that
0 A:  Yeah.  It sure does.  I really would like to have something like that, and
0 B:  [Breathing] that really sc-, I, I guess, I, that, that a little more than
1 scared me, that irritated me, uh, that, because it, it, it surely didn't come
0 A:  -- then they were like paraplegics.   
0 particularly with, with back seat, uh, with some, where kids, were, were
0 into the front seat, and there was enough stretching, [breathing] the
0 A:  Yeah.   
1 B:  Yeah.   
0 A:  -- Uh-huh [lipsmack].  And we wanted to travel, well, that was really nice
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 went on down to Disney World, and it got better than, I think twenty-two,
0 bigger vans, uh, they're, uh, my boss just bought a, a pick up truck, and, uh,
0 what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in?  Ford.  A what?
0 well of course, Oldsmobile has got one, and Chryslers got one, but they drive
1 B:  Yeah but, the little, thing etched in it, say objects are, are closer than
0 inches across not nearly a foot high,
0 A:  well, see that's the reason we couldn't make, really make them, at first
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Oh that would be good.   
0 A:  Oh I think so too,  
0 A:  But, uh, I think it's fantastic.  I wish they required it in everything.
0 B:  Yeah.    
0 wait and let her dump them off tomorrow.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 bag --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  They had tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or
0 A:  Oh, that's a good idea.
0 real cute, you know, with a bunch of big old flowers --
0 the tickets, though.  {talking to someone off the phone} What do you get for
1 since we're doing this thing called Operation Desert Shield, we're sending
1 around to it.
1 B:  Do you all have can banks?
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well they're certain places, you know, where down there you can
1 B:  I don't know.  I'm trying but,
0 B:  I'm not that dedicated.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  So.
1 B:  Huh.  And I don't want to go with those canvas bags right now, I'm sorry.
1 I'm not that European [laughter].
1 A:  I'm a finance major.
1 B:  Well, that's why I did what I did.  I went into teaching [laughter].
1 the smaller ones and make it more equitable.
1 one?
1 A:  Yeah [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter] I'm not looking forward to it, but something's got to be done.
1 A:  Yeah.  Oh yeah, we've had one as long as I can remember [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] Well, it's going to hit us.
0 B:  But other than that.  Well, can you think of anything else we need to talk
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Oh, I don't [laughter] know [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] Have you thought about that?
1 A:  No, I never really thought about it [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  So she's into this.  
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].
1 A:  I know. We went to (( )), well whatever in Plano, and the emergency room
1 was like a bad comedy show [laughter].
0 one and he just put a big old cast on it.
0 said, he said you'd be surprised how many basket-, how many people come in
0 here with things like that because they are active.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Because I got up and started jumping on it again.
0 about five years ago.  I broke my heel.
0 B:  And, uh,
0 B:  -- the normal cushion that you have there.  
0 like, not running, but playing a little bit of tennis, or can you not do stuff
0 B:  Uh, well I haven't tried that.  I don't know.  It's been I bet it's been
0 thirty years since I played tennis.
0 A:  That's probably the safer way because I notice in aerobics a lot of the
1 A:  -- I'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coro, coronary.
1 maybe that's a handicap access, and then I said no,
1 A:  And my husband being a T I engineer, I said a few things to him when I got
1 home, I said, who has engineered that?  [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah really.
1 A:  [Laughter]  Yeah but,
0 He said that, don't worry, he says, even if you weren't doing anything your
1 body would start, that would start to happen to you.
1 A:  I said, uh, why do I feel like I need to start pushing myself more.  And he
1 goes, human nature [laughter].
1 A:  And then, you know, you see these little girls in these little bitty
1 A:  But luckily at (( )) there's a little more diverse clientele.
1 B:  Yeah.  I try to go real late or real early before they get there
0 ask, I just feel like, boy, am I stupid or what.
1 A:  It's terrible.  I don't know if the Dallas location, it just seems that,
0 A:  Yeah, but if you don't live near there that's not worth,
0 it's all the same to me.  Richardson, over on Campbell and Park Hill there's a
1 A:  And as we were doing it, too, everybody noticed that there were all these
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 in some kind of immobilized walker, because he doesn't like to put casts on
1 A:  -- adjust that.  You know more about this stuff than I do, obviously then,
1 the other side.
1 A:  [Laughter] (( )).
0 I'm afraid to use it.  But, uh, I bought it for target practicing and, uh, and
1 A:  An-, you know, I do like to have my guns.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.  Uh,
0 A:  And, uh, they had a waiting period and, uh, we bought it there.  #And,# 
0 uh, I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun [laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 loose as loose can get.
0 A:  [Child_talking] Yeah.
1 [child_crying] that thing one time.  Almost knocked me down.
0 you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know
1 A:  That's a good, I've never thought of that.
1 B:  Wow.  He was fortunate.  He could, [laughter] he could of hit something
1 else #[laughter].#
1 It was about four or five years ago.
1 B:  #[Laughter].#
0 A:  Well, see, uh, my husband has a thing.  If they go to, uh, regulating, uh,
0 [sniffing] all right, uh, banning guns.  Pri-, pri-, pri-, private cit-,
1 A:  -- this, my kid is jumping on me.  I can't hardly talk.
0 they're making you, uh, uh, get one at, at birth.
1 A:  [Swallowing] Yeah.  And everything about you.
1 uh, probably your, uh, my kid is banging.  I was seeing what they was banging
1 what time you go to the bathroom.
0 A:  #No, that's# that's a little bit extreme.  But they could know anything and
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  And there's, there's no waiting period on that.
1 A:  No.  None whatsoever #[laughter].#
1 A:  Uh, we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have.
1 the money, so I can't complain too much.
1 NINJA TURTLE movie [laughter].
1 B:  Right.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well, what other movies have you seen then lately?
0 A:  You know, it wasn't impressive necessarily, but it was better than it could
0 childish.
1 A:  -- you ought to make it at least semi-,
0 B:  It's pretty good.  But we take her to just about every movie, and, she, uh,
0 B:  So, if and when we ever get a baby-sitter, like we did with SILENCE OF THE
1 B:  [Whispering] {sort of to herself} Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw?
0 B:  That's neat.
0 A:  And you could tell it, and I guess that I thought was a real good acting
1 A:  I really enjoyed it.
1 A:  -- because I had just gone overboard the first time.  I don't know but,
1 AND A HALF is coming out.
0 A:  -- I love those movies --
1 B:  -- because that looks hilarious,
1 A:  That's exactly what,
0 B:  I know, because we can go spend fifteen dollars --
0 B:  -- the three of us.
0 popcorn is not that expensive.
0 B:  So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn
0 A:  -- of like when the buffalos are, when they're chasing the buffalos and
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 times.  You know what I mean, you know.
1 A:  Yeah, but, well,
0 --
0 said, there are certain things you can't do with a video --
1 A:  Oh, I do too.
0 A:  Well, I can understand that.  It's that time of the year.
0 A:  I guess, in the, since I got out of college, which was about five years
0 B:  -- in terms of, you can watch every week.
1 A:  -- like, like on T V, because, it, like, it gets real aggravating if you
0 exhausted and they wanted to watch, and we said okay, well we'll sit down and
1 A:  Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V, you know.
0 A:  And then all of a sudden, I started paying, paying attention to {very soft
0 A:  -- you know, you watch some of the cartoons, and kids --
0 when our children were younger, when they were like four years old, three
1 studies that they do that show, you know, that everybody's I Q has dropped
1 regular T V that we watched, we had to watch an hour of public T V
0 B:  That was just the rule.  And if they saw us watching the, something, they'd
1 A:  I can't handle it very long.
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 A:  But, [noise] uh, it, it's, you're missing an awful lot.
0 A:  -- you know, things like that.  But I don't follow any team.
0 that suffices me.  But,
1 comedian comes up.  You know what I did.  There was a time there where I could
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  In fact, it's, I think it's on tonight [laughter].
0 A:  You can tell, they pick up the words every once in a while.
1 A:  I try to.
1 B:  Yeah, we try to stay up, too [laughter].  
0 B:  Yeah, it was, we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle
0 B:  It's funny now, and it's better, but it's real different --
0 A:  That's right.
1 be outrageous.  So,
0 are a few things around still but,
0 B:  Well.
0 A:  Oh, really.
0 A:  Oh yeah. 
0 There've been some interesting subject that they've called about.  How many
0 B:  Oh, about ten or eleven calls.
0 B:  As far as the number of drug users, you mean?
0 that are worried about it or are taking drugs, actually go and then usually a
0 lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything.
0 A:  Yeah, and our numbers have been way down.  I don't know what they were.
0 A:  But, uh, they say that there, it's almost down to zero where people come
0 few mistakes, and that, of course, has got to be critical.  It's got to be, if
0 know, first class, totally independent agency.  Not local of course.  Ours, I
0 B:  So yeah, I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that.
1 A:  No, no, I don't care about that, she'll be on the phone all night.
0 A:  Do you have children?
0 [clicking] Austin, and one at home, and I always say that I've learned so much
0 B:  Yeah.
1 you're cool parents and all that.
0 that they're very cheap until they get to start driving.
0 drive this summer, so kids are, cost you practically nothing, because you
0 expensive.  As they get older --
0 B:  No, I can't think of anything else to say about that either.
0 drive one to do that are appearance or general health or some, some need for
1 A:  -- and I haven't been cursed or blessed with either,
1 up on occasion.
0 A:  When uh, I got married, I was working a summer in college in construction
1 A:  -- and twenty years old, and I was just this little toothpick up there.
1 A:  Had to buy a new suit for it, just to fit in there.
0 managed to keep some weight and not lose so much during the summer.  And I
1 B:  Well, to give you some perspective, my brother's six two and weighs about
1 bigger than me, for the most part.
0 B:  Um.
1 A:  Right.
0 could sure tell the difference though after the first year or so of being
1 or two,
0 A:  those ten speeds and their unforgiving seat that I sit on, but they tend
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
1 way back up.
1 push along the way,
0 A:  I sat down to, one of the nurses did the, oh, they do that um blood deal --
1 control.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  -- and we're trying to cut down on meat, and, you know, we're doing all
0 Cadillac up there on Central Expressway --
0 B:  -- that, uh, {pause} in addition to getting a new car there, they can get
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  And it's been a real good car --
0 B:  The guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes.  He says it'll
1 probably be gone in a done, and it's probably gone by now.
0 A:  Oh no [laughter].
1 you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it.  Is it a
0 B:  And then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting.
1 B:  No, huh-uh.
0 A:  It'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car [laughter].
0 was picking up, uh, some background noise, so I just switched the channel up
0 B:  Right, right, that's fine.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Eventually.
0 cars, and I've always bought them new.
1 B:  {Pause} But, uh, {pause} my car is using two quarts of oil a week now.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  So she's going to sell it rather than trade it in.
0 forty-two hundred.  So,
0 A:  What I think.  So,
0 get it for in Arlington --
0 especially if we add on the equalizer --
0 B:  And you laughed all the way to the bank.
0 sure enough I saw that guy, and he recognized me.
1 A:  And the next day they pulled the white car and took it to Arlington.  So
0 B:  I'll bet you did.
0 A:  I have a Hyundai.
1 but if my financial situation was different there's probably other cars I
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah, and then, oh, they do ride nice, too.
0 A:  In fact,
1 B:  Oh.
0 with that.  I think it's comfortable.  I'm really sold on (( )) you know.  I,
0 A:  See, I used to work at Lemmon Avenue, so I, that's right across the street
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah, got to see them all the time.
0 figured it was going to have to last me a while, you know.
1 A:  So I decided, no matter what, if I had to let a bill go,
1 that had one.  That's good to hear.
1 A:  There's a lot of people at Lemmon Avenue that have them.  [laughter] I
0 A:  -- they didn't take it in and have it serviced when they were supposed to.
0 B:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.  Luckily my husband is real good at that, and he knows how, and he
0 B:  I know.
0 would want a sun roof.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Oh, I see.
0 B:  Well, that's good.
1 A:  Boo.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
1 B:  the vinyl, you know.
0 B:  Those are the best, supposedly the best built cars.  So,
0 B:  The little Volkswagen he has, he's loving it.  Well,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Right [laughter].
0 B:  It'd be gone in a week.
0 B:  too.
0 B:  Is that right?
1 B:  I bet.
0 A:  Do #it himself.#
1 it [breathing].
0 everything else, I decided, uh-huh, time to settle down and do something.  So
0 B:  Uh, working, clean up the roadsides --
0 unemployment division, and his sole job was just tracking down people who were
0 B:  I mean, I was astounded.  I don't even make that.
0 that amount being spent on the bureaucracy.
0 B:  Yeah, no doubt.
0 A:  Yeah, I mean, this is the kind of thing you look at. 
0 can't read --
1 and they, they did it better than we do.
1 A:  I know.
0 know, when I's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math, I
0 A:  You know, we need, what's more important, picking up the garbage or
1 educating our kids.
0 A:  Yeah, they, they, sure.
0 And they wouldn't come back, so they went bankrupt.
0 B:  And, and they all lost their jobs.
0 going out at the same time.  And, well, that took care of that industry --
0 stopping car manufacturing in this country.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  That's about right.
0 it is.
0 A:  same old thing. I mean,
0 B:  that's right.  That's like Eagle Scouts.
0 A:  All right.
0 A:  Um, I run occasionally.  Let's see what else do I do.  Play golf some, and
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  We used to try and belong to clubs or the Y, stuff like that, but it was so
1 week, but the last little while, for one reason or another, we haven't been
1 B:  And we've, I had, having both of them natural, the first one was natural
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't
1 A:  -- or be real sore afterwards.
0 A:  Been good talking to you as well.
1 ==============================================================================
1 A:  In Dallas, about another block over, I'm in Garland [laughter].  So,
0 B:  I thought ten was the maximum.
1 B:  My husband does.
1 A:  Unofficially I'm going to go work for a supplier of ours.  
0 A:  Yeah, well the Vice President for Operations for Onum stationed in Korea is
1 to retire and go to work for him.
1 to have three, 
0 A:  [Laughter] there by September.
0 B:  Well, how did they decide which colleges to go to and what'd you tell them.
0 living on a campus.
0 something like that.
0 wanted to come home, I got in the car, hopped [laughter] you know, I was home
0 in a couple of hours.
0 home body, I mean, this was a kid who, who when she was little and went to
1 stay over at somebody's house at night, I'd always know I'd get a call at ten
1 been away before.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 to be in a more of a small, small school environment.  So we went down one,
0 interviewed, and it just kind of met her, her criteria.  It's a school of
0 they would get out, but they got, they ended up getting more or less the same
0 A:  -- because after all the degree just gets you in the door.
0 do, I think that would be important to deal with too, because, when, then when
0 daughters, that started off (( )) My oldest thought she wanted to major in
0 A:  And fortunately, as a, as a freshman, everything she's taken has been, is
0 there.
0 going to do that until the end of our sophomore year when we wanted, we came
1 wall decision.
1 A:  I see.  
0 speaking from other ignorance.
0 A:  Right.  
1 A:  So, then I had to go back and buy two more,
0 B:  Buy two more [laughter].  
0 we've had done to the car.
0 B:  up,
1 B:  And he had to get two new ones, too,  
1 ((the outlook)),
0 don't know any better, you know, so,
1 real glad my husband knows something about cars,
0 A:  Right.  
1 wants and then he'll stay, well, well, call my wife if there's anything else
1 that needs to be done [laughter],
0 A:  I see.  
1 we've got some good news and we've got some bad news,
0 A:  Right.  
0 A:  I see.  Well, I, I wish I would have been paying more attention when I was
0 out messing around with, uh, my Dad when he was, uh, out looking at the cars,
0 A:  it should be going, 
0 B:  All that scheduled maintenance ((right)).
0 A:  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah, that, uh, thirty or forty dollars you
1 showoff,
0 one day I had told my brother, I said now, I know everybody's suppose to
1 A:  Oh, Lord [laughter].  
1 me for the rest of my life with this jack attached,
1 conditioner was on, the door was closed, and I couldn't knock because I had to
1 B:  I finally, with my elbow, rang the doorbell and mother came to the door
1 and I wouldn't let her touch me [laughter],
1 down pretty quickly and it didn't take him long to extricate,
1 A:  To, to get that jack out,
0 A:  that's all right.  Oh, that's a funny story. 
1 B:  So, that's, that's how mechanical I am.  
1 B:  I, I've not tried it since. 
0 side,
0 A:  Oh, Lord.  
0 A:  any time, that's right.  Well, that's, uh, that's the way I feel, I, I
1 somebody to take care of my cars.  So, um,
0 A:  Yeah, um, up here some of the state parks are really nice and some of them
0 B:  Yeah, it, it was pretty early in the year. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Yeah, we, we have, we have a dog and that's just about as bad as a kid
1 and, or what he wants to do, we had brought his friend along, was play in the
0 B:  Huh.
0 B:  Yeah, or, or get, my brother has a real nice pop-up. 
0 in the back of the bed.  Um, and they sleep in the pop-up.
0 B:  Yeah, he did have a problem, uh, when he went camping last year in Beavers
1 heavy and they were all, everybody was trying to flee the campsite,
1 A:  But it took them a little while? 
1 though that were, that were stuck.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 and I have worked in El Salvador and, uh, we visit Mexico occasionally, so,
0 than,
1 anything that's, that's anti-Communist, you know, we kind of had a tendency to
0 B:  I didn't feel that we really ex-, exploiting them any.
1 only thing that they had a great abundance of was, uh, you know, human beings
0 there, I stayed quite a, a bit at the, uh, uh, one of the big hotels ((San))
0 B:  uh, oh, you know, it's, it's the, uh, the almost stereotype, you know,
0 don't believe that we were quite that bad, but yet they were having to deal
1 quite as much of that sort of thing, as Panamanians are just about as
1 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh {very faint}. 
0 Corps, uh, that I knew of, did marry Peruvians,
0 too, to get that going and spread and then, of course, Peace Corps bowed out
0 of that because that's, uh, uh, something that nationalized very quickly.
0 and then have it,
0 you know, like,
0 I did teach economics at the university one night a week, and the textbook was
0 A:  because I'm pretty frugal about things like that. 
1 B:  And, that's, I, I know people who don't have any credit cards at all and
0 I'm always amazed [laughter], because I don't know how they can get by
0 into a motel.
0 B:  Uh-huh {very faint}. 
0 kind but,
0 come up with but, um,
0 B:  medicines.  And then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it
0 enough time for the insurance to get back.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 but they were still paying their minimum,
1 you,
0 marriage, 
1 A:  think so, they've been married almost thirty-five years so,
0 credit card again,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
0 A:  Well, as you say, when you're taking children to the doctor,
1 B:  Oh, isn't that silly?  
0 during the year and what we un-, and I think we got back fifty cents or
1 something,
0 A:  Uh-huh {very faint}.
0 B:  and I sent it through, you know, sent it through the check, through the
0 B:  for a returned check,
0 B:  so, now, she's already doubled the price of her check and I've sent it
0 A:  For one twelve dollar check. 
1 A:  I was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing.
0 A:  and, uh, we, it's very difficult to find their stations, so, I guess that's
0 your credit card and Texaco and Chevron and somebody else, is not anymore,
0 they'll take it, you know, at the cash price, or you, they'll now let you
0 A:  So, what they're doing, they're discounting for cash is the way they're,
0 A:  because I think it is illegal to add a surcharge, so, that's, that, they're
1 B:  Right and, and they've changed that now. {Talking to someone in the
1 A:  it's going to cost us money, we don't ((though)) [laughter].
1 States,
1 who charge it up to ten thousand dollars,
1 credit card business.
1 B:  We need to start our own credit card. 
1 A:  That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?  [laughter]. 
1 A:  Sure, sure.  
1 A:  Well, this should be very interesting,
0 B:  I believe that's correct, uh-huh.
0 A:  with, uh, uh, they should have, have pride in this because it's, it's a
0 A:  so that, uh, it, [breathing] uh, the police could check up on you.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  -- well, we seem to be one in favor and one against.
1 A:  Although neither one of us are, are, uh, really uh, uh, dyed in the wool.
1 A:  They're liable to tear up my membership.
0 B:  Yes, I did, uh-huh.
0 B:  Sure, I can understand that.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  That'd be neat.  Sure would.
0 A:  Really?  Yeah see, I didn't, I don't, I thought, uh, I thought, I lived in
1 B:  so, uh, you know, I, I forget from year to year.  I'm getting too old.
0 B:  but I guess, you know, we're just out of March, and, uh --
0 B:  -- will bring the rain in, uh,  April.
0 A:  Yeah, I know.  It's been bothering me a lot, but yeah, I think, nor-, I
0 A:  Uh,
1 and it's beautiful, and all the trees are pretty, and I wish it would stay
1 [Breathing].
0 they'll consider,
0 now is the result of that [breathing].  If they can get the army,
0 far as diplomacy is concerned [breathing].  I think it's been a good, a good
0 B:  It, yeah.  Tha-, that's incredible but they had to, uh, go in the direction
0 floodgates, as far as with glasnost and poistro-, perestroika and stuff, and I
0 A:  Yeah.  Uh, I understand.
1 [breathing] you know, he's a tough guy, I mean, he's been through it
0 makes the problem most severe, and makes him look, look worse that what his,
0 A:  [Breathing].
0 mean, there's revolution.  You know, and that's [breathing], 
1 A:  It seems to be headed in that direction too.
0 cellular phones, and [breathing] state of the art equipment that we are so
1 A:  [Lipsmack] Yeah, I'm sure a lot of them are missing those [breathing]
1 household items [breathing] [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah, the major conveniences of life [laughter].  
0 there and what, you know, what you have and what you don't have.
0 A:  [Lipsmack] Yeah I agree [breathing].
0 A:  Yeah, I can go with that answer too [breathing].  The only yes I could go
0 nonfeeling machine type people, and they're people just like us.  I mean --
0 B:  Now that's it's all over with, you know. 
1 involved is the, the reports that I hear back and of course on the news I try
0 to listen and also read between the lines you know [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 like the first, first priority ought to go to American businesses, which I
1 A:  But, I, you know.
1 A:  Boy, don't you know, I mean we don't seem to slow down even when there is a
0 B:  Go over there and rebuild all those.
0 B:  I think it's such a shame that the Iraqis had to just go destroy
0 A:  I do too. 
0 B:  I mean, what's, what good is that?  If I can't have it, you can't have it,
0 you know that sounds like something a little kid would do. You know.
0 B:  Yeah, to help out.
1 the fifth largest army.  Well, he may have but you,
0 A:  You know, I know they tried to turn it into a holy war, because to them
0 B:  Saddam Hussein is not a religious person, but he uses it. 
0 A:  Sure. 
1 A:  but I don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have
0 know, there's this United Nations or world government or whatever they keep
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  who has had to go through all of this and the suffering.  I'm sure with
0 A:  Yes.
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  I know, isn't that amazing the way that they will find their cause no
0 A:  But, see you are also getting back to the ages old problem of Arab-Israeli
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 is the way that women are paid.
0 B:  that when they make like, you know, sixty cents,
1 B:  on the dollar for what men make for the same jobs, and tha-, I mean I can
0 so much in my job, but I know in other professions, uh, 
0 B:  And, uh, just, you know it's just not fair [laughter].
1 B:  I don't know what to do about it.
0 A:  do what you want to do.
0 get stuck with most of the, you know, running the house type chores.
0 B:  You know, taking care of the kids, and you know, arranging their schedules
0 B:  It's just a real shame, you know, I think when you look at the changing
1 the kids are dirty and,
0 A:  are, are a little more in touch with the household chores and duties and
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  So it will be my children who really make big changes, I think, because
0 their mothers.
1 B:  But, uh, I guess, as long as you are single, you have to support yourself
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  a long time to, to get up to the pay scales of the white man, and now I
0 B:  In San Antonio, well,
1 A:  We have a woman mayor.
0 A:  Well Texas had a woman governor a hundred years ago.
0 governor, and he died or something.  
0 you know, especially in a state like Texas would elect a woman governor.
0 B:  And, uh, like I said, I really have [laughter] no interest in politics,
0 handle.
0 A:  but the world.  Several major countries in the world that we deal with
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 coffee or something.
1 A:  with too much risk. 
1 A:  Now, as to the question of what to do about it. 
0 B:  Oh, heavens [laughter].  I would, 
1 A:  Uh, it has to be government regulation. 
1 A:  I don't either [noise].
0 B:  #Oh.#
0 A:  Well, yes, but he's in very poor health, so you know,
0 B:  Oh that, well there are too, I think there is too many savings and loans
0 then it, it just snowballed.
0 right now.
0 Missouri and there are, you know, mostly banks and maybe a couple of savings
0 B:  I mean, I have never seen so many as there are down here. 
0 A:  Oh, really.  That's interesting. 
0 B:  They're, they're, they're just everywhere.  A-, and, you know, set up
1 A:  Oh, yes, yes, #this is true.#  
0 a while before they built the little building.
0 millions a lot, a lot better than they ar-, have been.  Dickson is the only
0 Dickson is the only one I even heard of.
1 mess.  That, the, the stealing, because, uh, stealing and leaving the country
1 probably they ca-, they probably can't find them [laughter] so what the deal 
1 A:  You know, you've got a good point there. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  And how many of them have, were invested in [laughter], #how many of
1 them have invested in a savings and loan?  [Laughter].#
1 look at the I Thirty condos. I know somebody at T I that bought one of them
0 loans out to dry #on the,#
0 extremely touchy, picky about my credit, bu-, but I know people that just
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  [Laughter] Have you been talking to males?  Yeah, yeah, this is, this is
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh, yes.  They are getting older now,
0 then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah, it's a tough one.   I mean, I've done some of both. 
0 things.
1 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  [Laughter] You know, the money was the issue.  
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 future, I mean, do you think things are going to change, or are we going to
0 A:  Uh, and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with
1 they, I don't know, I, from speaking from my children, the-, they aren't real
0 B:  Oh, yes, the, the numbers are still very skewed to say the least.
1 A:  It's horrible things,
0 him that's, that's the thing.
1 A:  Ha-, have you ever gone back? 
0 B:  yeah, it was, it was really nice.  We've got some nice, uh, uh, Persian
1 B:  That we still have.  Those are very nice. 
1 B:  Well, you ca-, you can, but they're expensive. 
0 out of there any more.
1 the handmade ones are very easy to spot because you have the same, uh, you
0 am I trying to say.  Not the picture, it's the, uh, way it's woved,
0 B:  You know, we-, woven,
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 to get a couple of them for myself.
1 B:  Yeah they,
1 B:  (( )) I don't want to wait until your dead. I mean,
1 B:  Yeah, just to spite us, you know. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 of them over there.  A lot of them, a lot of airplanes, a lot of ground
1 aircraft against the Kurds we're going to shoot um down, okay, well, wow wee,
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  but it's pretty gruesome,
1 sitting there surrounded by hostile Arabs and to maintain this is our
0 A:  last week, 
0 A:  you know, the, about the migration ((has)) shift and, and, jeez, I don't
0 know what their doing with all the people.
0 their, their, their filling up to fast and their, their just getting to many
1 B:  and so I keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain, it's going to rain,
0 A:  And we have a lot of trees in our yard and I probably, they're pretty old,
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 a cave all the time,
1 B:  Yeah.  Well, my three and half year old, he really wants [children] to have
1 A:  Well, yeah. 
0 B:  -- any day, I mean all Winter long [laughter] he's been wanting a pool in
0 everyone kept saying, oh, you're going up north it's not going to be so hot,
1 it's not going to be so humid,
1 A:  -- has been, 
0 B:  -- gosh. 
1 A:  the stress, and the heat, the record heat, and, you know, I was worried
1 B:  -- he's just wa-, he feels like he's burning like he's been baking for an
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 get all muddy,
1 [laughter],
1 B:  Yeah, we have a dog too so that adds to it --
0 A:  Well, I don't know, do, the nice thing I'm looking forward to is, uh, not
1 B:  Oh, yeah, because Houston was really hurricane alley, wasn't it,
1 B:  Oh, boy. 
1 A:  That's right. 
0 A:  Well --  
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  hurricanes, so, 
0 A:  -- have, were here last Summer that, 
1 B:  And I can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that, I just don't
1 even want to go out, you know, of the house to get the mail even [laughter],
1 A:  That is pretty bad. 
0 A:  Oh, I know. I can't imagine. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 air pollution and one thing it kind of hits the old pocketbook a little bit
0 uh, letting them rundown and use a quart a oil a mile like some of these smoke
0 because it's fast, it's clean, it's really efficient and its, it's actually
0 A:  That's true, yeah. 
0 energy policy, period.  And, our energy policy is just nil, just is
0 nonexistent.  And, uh, if we had one, you know, striving to meet certain
0 standards and certain goals and really to push it and, uh, let the
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 other suburbs suburbs and run the DART system throughout the suburbs to
0 A:  And it's a large place.  I mean we're talking about,
0 it, 
1 it keeps firing and dumping and I just, blew me away.
0 for me and people who do know that we're drug clean, if you will, that, uh,
0 is a nurse tells me that there are a lot of drugs, prescriptions drugs like
1 test them.  Uh, I don't know.  Uh, I'm not in the medical profession,
0 B:  Well,
0 same as yours from that standpoint.  I spent thirty-four years in education,
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 B:  uh, you know, and then I see, um, um, the, uh, the problem with testing,
0 A:  yes, steroids, #right.# 
0 A:  It just seems to me the idea of having random, and I agree with the idea of
0 A:  Base, uh-huh.
0 habituating drugs that are used [barking],
0 thing that somehow legislatures do to pressure from the private,
0 B:  That's right.
0 B:  seat belts,
0 B:  as I'm sure your wife will tell you of age. 
0 in a work place where they can be randomly checked when it happens then they
0 stand a chance of being turned in and you got ways now of cutting the whole
0 B:  Right, right.
0 A:  that kind ever pressure. 
0 that perhaps they, uh, money is spent in the wrong spots.  Uh, I, th-, I, uh,
0 the level where you need to have it.  You can't wait until their already in
0 doing for themselves,
0 I will keep in, in touch, with maybe, like who's in the top five of hitting,
0 A:  Well that's true, they don't have the offense to, uh, to get out, or to
0 statistical, gee, how can you draw a conclusion from it, but they find that,
0 that the following year, you'll have a bad year.  And they, they've got, um,
0 wait and wait and wait and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run
0 A:  I think the Royals will do okay.  They have, they have several pitchers
0 B:  Well I go to Saint Louis from time to time and I watch, I, I watch their
0 here I think.
0 A:  I lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis, yeah.
1 B:  Ye-, everybody does, right.  
0 A:  Yeah, oh yeah, I, I definitely do, in fact I've got family that still
0 training so far.
0 the people that they're going to play, then that might be pretty good
0 need to do to win though, is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has
0 A:  and just kind of assume that, you know, so-, one of them is going to
0 career years.
0 A:  No.
0 B:  -- a, a local commentary and,
0 B:  Well didn't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their --
0 A:  Oh yeah, they, they spent more money,
0 A:  It really doesn't, so.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 @B:  Fantastic. Well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, uh, about
0 the problems.
0 they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready.
1 for, for what, you know.
0 A:  Yeah, he's going to be going to kindergarten, so.
0 A:  So, you know, we're, we're thinking about that.  What's that going to
0 suicide.  
0 B:  Right.
0 uh, people, I think.
0 B:  So, uh,  
1 that never happened.  You never heard about that.
0 A:  No.  And now, you know, what do we have now.  You know, got kids that,
0 being a student and think what, what's it going to be like for my, my
0 youngest, an my oldest son, when he goes to school.  What's going to happen?
0 I mean I, I'm afraid for him to go.
0 active and everything in school, but, uh, you know, with all the peer pressure
0 that's going on, with all the negative things, it is, uh, it's a tough
0 was, well I was, I graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine, so.
0 problems as they come up.
0 problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or,
0 or your parents. 
0 B:  Right.
0 them at the home.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh, ((Delford)) have you ever heard of that? 
1 A:  Right, uh-huh. 
1 B:  Oh, but it's bound to be beautiful [laughter].  
1 A:  Well, it's pretty good, yeah [laughter].  Uh, there's quite a few children,
0 regular basis.  And there's mostly in my wife's family, uh, my family's very
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Oh.
0 A:  Where in New Hampshire?
1 A:  I said, I'm from Maine originally. 
1 B:  Oh, really?  [Laughter].  
1 B:  Yeah, yeah.  Seems to me, well, the, the, the, uh, main event, of course,
0 it's, it's sort of a high-class potluck, I guess you could say.  And, uh, it's
1 try something new,
0 She's got, uh, ten acres of property that go with, uh, with her house.
0 B:  and, and the parents can,
0 A:  What time of year do you, do you have it in the fall, like after,
1 they're all going to be there with their children [laughter].
0 that and then her stepfather has, uh, a daughter and a son and the son has
1 B:  So, they, I mean, they don't need much, uh,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Of course, the new thing is the Nintendo.  And, uh, all the kids seem to
0 A:  Yeah.
0 um, oh, and then we always video tape.
0 A:  Yeah, that's interesting.  That's a good idea.  Yeah.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Colorado is beautiful.
0 B:  and, uh, a bunch of us got together, 
1 drive in from New York so, uh, it's usually some kind of, uh, semireunion,
1 A:  I ((have no idea who)) listens to this. 
1 B:  Oh, God, close, Johnstown. 
0 A:  Ha, we're not suppose to do this [laughter].  I, I can, I'm from,
0 federal government and, uh, I'm a civil engineer but I'm taking a year off.
1 B:  I wasn't ((total)), I'm glad it was you because I was afraid I'd get some
0 thing or a mandatory.
0 A:  Yeah the way the, the way the voice ((might have)) worded it, it sounded
0 A:  Right.
1 long ago you went but,
0 A:  but I don't know how any, I mean, the whole thing sounds a little bit
0 B:  ((drives)) in school for this type of thing already, you know, not nec-,
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 if you,
1 B:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  That's quite different from up here, I guess, yes.
1 A:  Yeah, really, (( )), Pennsylvania, [laughter], (( )) listening, you know, I
0 just talked to my ((brother)), it's like really weird [laughter].
0 think that things that your talking about like anything that emphasizes the
0 B:  I think they can integrate maybe a short period of time in with high
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  Um, and they really, that's a good way to put it, I know, I went to high
0 Illinois,
0 A:  that kind of thing.
1 we call in this area, yuppie area and people,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  you know, but not that specifically but things along that (( )) of, of
0 proposes far as what age or, or how they would do this, but I feel that
0 very difficult, maybe by that time they're too, uh, calloused to what is,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Yes. 
0 anything.
1 B:  Yeah, I think so, uh,
1 str-, because I'm not in that part of the coun-, I don't care if they listen,
0 parental divorce in my family but, um, you know, it was always ((shuttle))
0 back and forth, so, uh,
1 A:  Yeah, I lived there in my early twenties, too, before I moved here
1 [laughter].
0 B:  Oh [laughter].  That's the,
0 an S P one thousand which, has a, it has a fast processor in it, a three
0 B:  Oh, yeah, I'd like to have one for the house, too, but sometimes (( )) my
0 B:  Man, there's so, they're, I learned so many things that they, they do,
1 they're into so many different things, so.
0 B:  Software design engineer, so, as they call it, so.  But I have a degree in
1 B:  So, but I've been at it for, you know, five years, so.  Everything's
1 A:  So that kind of reeks havoc with plans,
1 pocket change to a lot of people [laughter].
0 B:  Um, all I, the packages I, I don't really use, I (( )) what I use that
0 (( )) outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been
0 A:  Yeah.  You probably use (( )) or something like that, 
0 B:  That's right, you know, it gives me a paycheck, you know, it's only like
0 television ratings don't come out, you know, all the time.  They only come out
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh, will they let you take a computer home to work? 
1 B:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah, my hu-, he took one home when they, when they had it,
0 B:  But I, you know, worked, I know most of them, well, I can't say that, a lot
0 know who they are, you know.
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  Yeah, you just know them by the telephone, so.  But, well, it's been good
0 @@A:  Yeah, we sort of stayed to the topic anyway. 
0 A:  Your name is Lynn?
1 read that?
0 A:  Uh, I haven't gotten through [laughter] it yet.
0 like a Christian book store.  I don't know what the chains are down there.
1 reading you've been doing, or do you, have you read any good novels lately?
0 B:  just joy reading.  Yeah.
1 B:  And I just realized I had never read it growing up.  So, I just finished
0 have the time to do --
1 B:  Just like, (( )) I want to read that and I write it down.
1 the ILLUSION, and A BRIDGE OVER TI-, A BRIDGE TO FOREVER.  Those are (( ))
0 But, uh, they, they were fun.  They were real just books for fun.
1 A:  -- just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with.
0 A:  Um.  Trying to think.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 some things like that.
0 A:  You, too.
1 A:  Huh.
1 house, and I'm a half hour, and so my transportation costs have gone up by,
0 B:  I'm exempt.
1 A:  Wow, must be nice.  
0 A:  Part of the high price spread.  Uh, no, well, we don't, we do, but we don't
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Not at all.
0 B:  Yes sir.
0 here in (( )).
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yes.
1 A:  -- or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar.
0 A:  I've heard of the book.
1 A:  And that includes everyone at T I.
1 A:  But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter.  
0 B:  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I, uh, when I was in Dallas I was supervisor,
0 B:  And, uh, I was appalled at what, how they were paying them.  I just

0 A:  Oh, my parents have a New England accent, but I don't.
1 A:  I've got a Texan wife and three Texan children.  
1 B:  [Laughter] You're still (( )).  I myself am a native Texas. 
0 A:  Right,
1 looking for?  And, uh, no, they'd say no.  And I'd be, well then shut up, you
0 I went to his house for dinner.  And they had a young son who was probably
0 British school and spoke to parents.  And after it was over she said, I went
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 voting.  And Margaret Thatcher was embarrassed that Janet would think she was
1 going to ask her [laughter] how she was going to vote.
1 A:  And her husband kept looking at her and said, I can't believe you could be
1 so dumb [laughter].
0 of peop-, if everybody says, oh, well, my vote doesn't count, you know, then,
0 A:  You know, the thing that, that I, surprised me even more, you know, if we
0 A:  Right, and it's, it's like a school board election.  You know, those of us
0 and too difficult decisions.  And I think of that every time I go find one of
1 these ballots.  And you not only get it in the presidential year, where you go
0 that people are just lazy.
0 Women Voters.  I, I don't know how long they've been around, maybe a long
1 and then I, I read a lot.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  I like to read, too [laughter].  I was trying to think of some
1 B:  Oh.
0 --
0 A:  Reading is a little bit easier to work around.
1 neglect what I should be doing.
1 A:  That's true, I do the same thing [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] You get so involved in what you're reading.
1 strictly by hand, um, sewing and quilting and, um, {pause} what else have I
0 B:  -- or give away as gifts.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  So.
1 A:  And I enjoy doing that.  It's just the same old thing, it's just getting
1 --
0 was, I was making some little things for Christmas, and I also made a little
1 thing for a baby gift, and, uh, I thought, Oh, I can do this while I watch T
1 V.  Wrong [laughter].
0 A:  -- I was wrong.  It took. it took a while to do.  But, it was fun, I
1 and, and, it was just too much to begin with.  And I think kind of discouraged
0 A:  Yeah I do, I do like to go to movies, and I have a V C R, so I like to rent
1 of tapes now, and whenever I go visit my parents, they're always saying, Well,
1 bring some of your tapes [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah.  I don't know too much about it either.  Mine's pretty limited to my
0 tomatoes and things at the house.  And I'd, I think when I was real little I
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  So.  I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the

1 that a hobby, but I have two cats, and I gave them a bath tonight, so they're
1 a little bit angry at me [laughter].
1 is not a hobby of mine.  So I thought,

1 A:  There not as likely to as a dog might, I guess.  But with little ones, I'd
0 B:  And if I was a cat or dog, I'd respond probably by biting or something.  I
0 B:  That'd be my self defense.  But,
1 B:  Well, I think we probably reached our time limit.
1 anyway.
0 uh, maybe a higher grade one, maybe the, the economics and the payback of
0 B:  I share your, your, uh, sense when you change job to work, or job to home,
0 Lotus product,
0 access at home to things like Works and WordPerfect, uh, but I, I do no-,
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  Ec-, I don't have {pause} a concern too much about the speed, however,
1 A P A printers.  And so I get frustrated, uh,
1 A:  [Laughter] [throat_clearing].
1 when I,
0 B:  got my first home computer, but i-, it would be, I think, a d-, a
0 I do at home, uh, and as a result, I don't get the comparative feel.  Uh, I
1 probably have never been in, noticed how wonderful it might be.
0 B:  Right.  Right, I, I do have some, uh, retirement modeling that I've done at
0 part of the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms
0 A:  I mean, not, not to this large scale as Iraq, but that,
0 A:  about, uh, like you say, using them, yo-, our interest there is, you
0 problems that we've fought for in other countries, you know, that they have
0 B:  Right, and the, probably the bigge-, biggest problem down there is that's
0 we can't get a handle on that through some, through some, uh, method, I don't
1 their money and so many communities have, uh, have to have that for farming
0 B:  Very much so, except when we need them.  You know when they found oil in
1 Mexico, then we got very friendly with them again.
0 A:  Ri-, recently [laughter],
0 B:  You too, dear.
1 mine is, is a, is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce,
0 A:  Uh-huh, great.

1 B:  And, I, we're big broccoli fans.
0 broccoli down on mine [laughter].
1 food cake and the blueberries and then that topping.
1 B:  What time should we be there?  [laughter].
1 A:  Right.
0 crust, and then you, you bake that and then you, um, take things like kiwi,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  it's real light and it, depending on the fruit you use it's, you know,
1 A:  Right.  That would be pretty.
1 [cough] [static].
0 A:  turkey breasts.
0 A:  No.
0 A:  Yeah.  Well ma-,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  No, uh-huh, it keeps a long time.
1 B:  Man, I'm going to have to think of that.  We're getting company tonight,
1 B:  -- lots of vegetables,
0 B:  to make up for the lack of meat.
0 A:  and just a little bit of, um, basil,

0 A:  Um.
0 take my raft and float along behind the boat and get a suntan.
0 B:  and then, uh, we sometimes get crickets and they, they fish for brim
0 B:  Yeah.  #You haven't?#
0 B:  Uh-huh.  And, um, also they have these, uh, wasps, the, the, uh, larvae,
0 A:  {Pause} [Clicking]  So, anyway, uh, uh, do you ever tip fish for catfish?
1 A:  #Uh, you know,# it's, it's sitting there on the dock and you go an hour,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] and nothings happening.
0 A:  We're talking about fishing Daddy {talking to someone in the background}.
0 A:  [Noise] Oh!!
0 he's actually prepared and ate what they caught.
1 B:  But, uh, we, you know, we started with just rudimentary things like worms
0 the, uh,
0 have calm days without a lot of wind, they seem to be a, far more prevalent.
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  But, you know, at, at Texoma, it's such a big lake, and we don't have a
0 A:  Oh, #great.#
0 A:  They are so expensive.
0 B:  that we used to ski, ski behind,
0 B:  #and, and, before# our, our children came along --
0 B:  Yeah, not in the summer?
1 A:  Um, {talking to someone in the room} Daddy, what's the nearest big city 
0 B:  How, how long does it take you to get there from Shreveport?
0 a two day trip and between appointments I got a chance to walk around and see

0 B:  #And I# know, it's getting off the subject a little bit, but, I, I, do you
0 A:  Yeah, they are.
1 impressed with them.  What, what year are you in at L S U?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  No, I'm going to go to, uh, I'm going to check into the University of
0 A:  I think it's thirty-six, yeah.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  #And,#
0 A:  Yeah, down here.
1 time I'd have the top down and maybe it was sixty in Dallas and then I'd drive
1 A:  I'll be darn.
1 B:  -- and so, I'd like to, I'd like to get the rain because I'm getting tired
1 of watering [laughter].

1 A:  Oh!
0 lot of them into work, because, hey, you spend a lot of time at work and so

0 A:  Oh, my gosh.
1 have a big yard though to be able to put,
1 B:  Oh, no, we have a tiny yard [laughter].
0 perfect yard for it because the sun comes up in the morning and strikes the
0 there and so they're not blowing as hard and, uh, then we get the eastern sun.
0 tree, I planted a big tree about ten years ago in my front yard.  It was a
0 fruitless mulberry, and it can, it takes that sun, and then it shades my front
0 A:  -- it was just horrible, but now it's not too bad at all.
1 water those silly things.  And, I just throw water, I don't do anything else
0 they'll be okay.  But, the problem, I think, most people have with African
0 Violets is that they water them too much and, uh, they are susceptible to
1 B:  #That's,# that's what really kills them, if there's too much water.
0 B:  I mean, you know, I've used up all my water give me some, that type of
0 A:  Yeah.
0 lot of little baby African Violets and stuff, because I break off a leaf and I
0 already established a root system, and you can take the little bag off and
1 B:  Yeah, it works great, you know, I've got, and my problem is I've got more
1 than I know what to do with [laughter].

0 have the choice.
0 A:  Right.
0 work, I want to stay home and do the child rearing, my wife has a good job and
0 B:  Yeah.  I've seen more and more companies that have, uh, parental leave, not
0 they have for the first couple of weeks.
0 A:  But, I don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do
0 have a paternity, he put paternity leave up there, but it might have just been
0 him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for

0 A:  Yeah.  I agree [laughter].
0 A:  and, be a mother for awhile, and then once they've gotten to school age

0 B:  Yeah, we, we have, that is, uh, as a matter of fact they update it once a
0 fairly frequent basis, over a, over a gin and tonic sort of thing.
0 than, than the paper would have anyway.
0 A:  My wife and I, you know, as mentioned, the question was, uh, do you get it
0 A:  Yeah it,
0 if fact, at T I.
0 A:  -- on the, uh, the news.

0 B:  #his guilt or innocence.# 
0 But, the man was not being tried for capital murder and so that was not even

1 A:  So, you know, I come out pretty good on it, I mean I get, plus my T I
0 A:  The last one I served on I was working at T I and so I got time off for it.
1 day after you go or before you go, so,
0 that,
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  I agree with, boy it's really easy [laughter] to discuss something when you
1 both agree [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].  Well, you know that, I mean I, you have to agree on this
0 that, um, you know, that yes he did it but he wasn't guilty, he didn't need to

0 Christians, and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas, and we got rid
1 impossible to do, but we did, [/noise] and so we don't want them back this

1 B:  I'm under the trees, I'm having fun, {pause} and I'm stopping to drink
0 water, so what's the problem?  [laughter].
1 everybody enjoys it, though.  Everybody has a different thing.  I kind of
1 [breathing] is to get a house where we can have a, uh, garden.  And so I'd
0 garden.
1 know anything about it, I have to learn, and then you'll have to give me a

1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  This is not a good subject.  Um, I, when, the little bit of time I do

0 A:  -- and, uh, so during the week, uh, I don't have much time, and I spend a
0 way away, so,
1 B:  Right.  Right. 
1 B:  Yeah.  That was a good show.  Um, what else do I enjoy?  Oh, my wife
1 know all the lu-, interoffice love affairs, and --
0 B:  -- uh, all that, all that kind of stuff, and you know, power struggles to
0 have a lot of court cases --
0 verdicts, you know, and you're always trying to out guess [breathing] is he
0 you know, twists and turns,
1 B:  twists, 
1 the very end of the case, after it's over, he's talking with her, and he
1 B:  It just left you hanging there like -- 
0 before he was going out to the big news conference, you know, to talk to the
1 guilty,
1 A:  Uh [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  not after that STAR SPANGLED BANNER thing [laughter].
0 B:  -- [Breathing] Bart Simpson's or COACH is another one.  It's a sports
0 girlfriend, the, that broadcasts, the anchor at the local news station, and
1 A:  in a way, I mean, I find it anyway, although, sometimes watching the news
1 the news, early news, and it's like, [breathing] uh, I didn't really need to
1 A:  because I have class tonight, and I would have missed the second half, and
1 B:  Right.
0 A:  [Laughter] you know, outcome, 
1 B:  Right.

1 A:  -- um, that's,
0 A:  -- a piece -- 
1 B:  -- about a dollar less.
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  [Laughter] But uh, uh,
1 with cable, though, is it's, it's, is that they show the same one over about

1 A:  so, uh, uh, you know he enjoys that but, uh, um, I, [laughter].
1 B:  [Breathing] Well, [breathing] I think we've probably talked long enough
1 [laughter] about this subject.
1 A:  [Laughter] Uh, yes.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  and just go in and just arbitrarily voting all --
0 B:  But, I understand why, I, I know one problem is, uh,

0 A:  Yeah, that's true, that's true.
0 A:  [Breathing] Do you ever or have you ever or do you ever actively work for a
0 A:  My wife and I were [throat_clearing] pretty heavily involved in [breathing]
0 B:  Yeah it's, I, I would imagine it would be pretty, I, I have, uh, a friend
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  so what, so do you think there's any, what, what could be done to improve
0 the,
0 B:  I don't know.  Well, I know, f-, for, you know, my son who is of voting age
0 off from work,
1 A:  Yeah, I don't know, really know what a solution would be.  I really don't.
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  I really don't know [breathing].  Well, maybe some other genius can figure
1 this out [laughter].
0 A:  I don't know.
1 gave, said, Oh, it would take me about, just about four hours,
1 there, [breathing] and he said, Oh, it's going to be just about four hours.
1 Well, [laughter] he was gone the whole day, and he said, Well, all I got done
1 A:  Isn't that amazing?
0 A:  because I put these beautiful French doors in --
1 A:  It took four days. 
0 A:  -- and pretty soon, before you know it, you know, he's run into so many
0 problems, and it's just, there's nothing there to be a problem I thought, but,
1 [laughter],
1 B:  Yeah.
1 it in a day.  Oh, right.  [laughter] so the whole project basically took a
1 B:  Oh, I know,
1 A:  Funny.  And I go what makes you a professional?  [laughter] You know?
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  [Breathing] No, and it really, like you said, always takes
1 B:  [Breathing] That when he actually got down to the painting part,
1 [breathing] [laughter],
0 B:  he, it was like [laughter] ten times longer than he already thought he
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  This was a, and it was a major project getting the money together
0 was kind of apologetic that it took so long.  He really came over here to
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Oh, boy.  
1 A:  [Laughter] And, yeah.
1 B:  Well, I don't recall my parents having that much trouble [laughter].
0 B:  I mean, you know, they painted our rooms all the time, [children_talking]
1 paint the outside all the time.  [lipsmack] and, um, I just don't think, you
1 all we have is like trim around the windows or something, and --
0 B:  -- no painting to have to do. I, [noise] {traffic outside} I don't know
0 that w-, [swallowing] like, uh, [/noise] say, we're freshly graduated from
0 school and things, so we haven't gotten to the point where we're [breathing]
0 needs.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  I tell you what, the fumes that the, the paint gives off makes you wonder
1 B:  [Children_talking].
1 B:  But, still,
1 B:  it's harmful, and they have to live with that every day --
1 B:  And, uh [breathing],
1 A:  Well, maybe there are some professionals out there [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  I guess it's ge-, getting to be lunch time, I need to go take care of the

0 they, they took me out to all of these places, you know, and it's, it's
1 not, but I think the beef down there is out, out of this world.
0 A:  No.  We went to, uh, uh, uh, I, we stayed at the Park, Park Plaza, Park
0 B:  Park Suite, yeah, right across the street, yeah.

0 care over there,
0 A:  Um.
0 most of them drive south for their jobs,
1 A:  Hum.  Well, I speaking of kids I've one hollering at me so,
0 B:  No. 
0 two coats, and are they,
0 A:  Yeah.  Uh, interior's not so bad because it's more fun, it's more, c-, but
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  I don't want it all over the brick and windows and,
0 without to much, uh, wear afterward.  The only problem was when we started
0 B:  Big long strips.  So what had happened is that professional painters had
0 A:  Oh, they just painted over varnished wood.
0 A:  Um.
1 B:  it comes off in strips, I mean not even little bit.  So we still have
0 whole thing,
0 B:  in order to do it again. 
0 A:  Thank you very much.
0 cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  So,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah, 
1 then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader, you know
0 Government, of course, mistreating a lot of the, uh, Slovak countries and
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 you know, so, uh --
0 B:  -- I don't know really what's going to happen.
0 A:  Are, 
0 B:  revolting themselves,
0 B:  it to happen. 
0 A:  I, I agree that, that the communication that now, that communication has,
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I don't mean to, well, I guess I do in a way,
0 uh, because of those co-, countries a lot, you know, where such Catholic
0 factor, as far as keeping the people down,
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 B:  [Breathing] I don't quite understand that.  Do they even understand
0 what's being said?
1 B:  Well, they actually understood, it is in America where it was hard
0 B:  -- is very, very, very close to Spanish. 
1 B:  Uh.
0 A:  [Breathing].
1 A:  Yeah.
0 knowing that, hey, up in other English colonies, or previous English colonies,
0 A:  educated than, than Africa or the Latin American countries.

0 compete with.
0 A:  Yeah [breathing].
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer
1 B:  Uh. 
0 B:  Well, I, I live in an apartment building and, and, uh, and, and, it, it,
0 it's ju-, just not feasible --
1 longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it.
1 Well, after you had an animal for a [laughter] couple of weeks, it's, uh,
1 house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is and,
1 home.  #But she's, she's usually pretty good.#
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, uh, I, I, I typically am not a cat person.
0 B:  I have a friend that, uh, has on occasion, uh brought her cat over for me
0 uh, that I would ever want a cat.  Oh, I like cats.  I just wouldn't want to
1 B:  Yeah.  You, they, they own you --
0 B:  grant you with you their presence, #you know.#
1 dog when I came home, uh, when I come home in the evenings, my dog greets me
1 up to me or to just run and knock me over.
1 A:  -- when she was younger, she used to do that to get even with me,
1 A:  #Uh, and, and,# you know, some people might not believe that but, but, but,
1 protest.
1 B:  #for me.  Looking, looking# at me eye to eye,
0 B:  #all the time while it was doing it.#  All right.  #Have I got your
1 attention now?#
1 staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she
0 he gave me the medication, the same medication that I gave her the last time
1 now.
0 B:  Huh.  Well, that's great, it really is.  I, [laughter] I'm glad ((that))
0 A:  #But what they,# well, what they do is, is they say, well it's going to
0 cost, you know, twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this and, and,
1 you know, and it creeps up on you.  You don't know that, uh, you know
1 all over.
1 plus the burial expenses.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.  Well even the, you know, they, they claimed they did the best that
1 A:  -- I'm, I'm looking for another cat for them.  Uh,
0 sometimes, it turns, it turns out to be, uh, uh, a pleasant experience for
1 A:  Okay.  What is that sound?
0 B:  That's my buzzer at the door [laughter].
0 to come to a party so have a voting party and, uh, you know, like in
0 communities [talking] and have the issues there and then everybody go vote
1 that's the only,#
0 A:  thing that I can figure out because I've heard so many people say well I'm
0 Or it won't make any difference if, if I don't vote [thumping] and I think it
0 B:  as having a party and then all voting, uh, when you have different
0 in the schools and the children from the little ones on up, with the idea of
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- some of ours.
0 And that's the reason I said maybe if you had something like a block party.
0 A:  And I hear so many people saying well I wish this would change, I wish that
0 B:  Yeah.  I, it's the same way with everything in education though.  It should
0 develop good learning patterns and you have some success and want to go on
0 to change them around at that point.
0 everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote
0 A:  [Tones].
1 A:  -- going to have to do what that person says, they would understand
0 Republican, they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and
0 then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat.
0 B:  -- you know, it's going to take the, uh, a whole generation of my feeling,
0 to use those voting machines and nobody ever showed us or anything so I
0 A:  -- laughed at them.  They thought that was funny.  #Ah, she don't even know
0 B:  #Right.  Uh-huh.#
0 A:  And, uh, I didn't know how to work the machine, you know.  And it really
0 B:  #Right.#
1 friends with children and I know they spend a lot of time with them.
1 B:  That's good to hear.  Yeah, an, I haven't, uh, well I've been around a lot
1 of people lately at wo-, at my job that don't have a lot of values [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, ye-, ha-, have a lot of values, I love that.  
1 A:  Do they have children?
1 B:  Uh, the one, the most valueless girl doesn't, [laughter] but she's married,
1 her a big ring and she got married to him.
1 met a couple who, who, they're just going to have their first child and they
1 B:  I'm like, really.
0 A:  You know, I have, uh, some friends that, uh, first of all, uh, the girls
1 you need a hobby, so, she chose the cats.
1 A:  [Laughter] Oh.
1 A:  They're really nice looking cats.  I have seven cats but they're all
1 mongrels [laughter].
0 time, just kin-, I couldn't, you know.  One time two of them came at once and
0 A:  and I said, I can't stand it, I brought him in so. [breathing] [laughter]
1 Those are my children.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Oh, yeah, real maternal [laughter].
1 then, but they'll, she'll finally accept it.  You know, they really don't have
1 any choice [laughter].
1 it.  I think they just learn to accept.  And I have two dogs too, and they've
1 B:  Yeah, well those (( )) cats were great.  They were fourteen pounds and,
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, and they are lovely but,
1 ge-, you know, to go out.  I just have two that drive me crazy,
0 start going in the front and stuff, I bring them in.
0 A:  We know we try, try real hard to keep them healthy.
1 B:  and not off of a busy street.  We're, we're choosing our house for our
1 cat.  Isn't that bad [laughter].
1 A:  People do it for their children [laughter], I mean, why not.
0 B:  Oh, them too [laughter].
0 B:  We-, because I, she loves, she's one of those that loves th-, outside, 
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  except that I consider them my children [laughter].
1 B:  I, we, we got married a few months ago and I'm like, well why can't Ashley
1 be at the wedding [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah, you know, if I could have, I would have.
1 A:  I haven't gone that far.  I'm not that bonkers.
1 B:  No [laughter].
1 B:  I put a bow on her one ni-, on day and Jerry just kept saying you are the
1 meanest person [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 and on down and they, they go on family vacations and, uh, they go, like to go
1 So, sh-, not only is she the better skier, but she got all the attention,
1 because she got to go out.  [laughter] [breathing] I think she planned it.
1 She's only five, but I think she planned it [laughter].
0 I, you know, to ha-, I was an only child, my mother was an only child so, I,
0 attention, so I wouldn't know.  I think I would be extremely jealous, or would
1 A:  It's a two story house, it, it's our first home, and it looks like it's
0 and then the carpet, you know, we need to replace the carpet.  I mean, it
0 B:  And, uh, seems like we're always working on it, as I'm sure,
0 A:  Because they're always, 
1 B:  Oh, yes. 
0 B:  You know, the gal I talked to in Maryland, didn't own a car, she's never
0 A:  then, I'd have to go to downtown Dallas and then walk over couple blocks
0 B:  If it's anything like, uh,
0 B:  Huh.
1 that.  And I didn't realize, when I moved here, that it was a separate town
1 B:  Well, yeah, it is. 
0 homes these days.
0 B:  Fifteen. 
0 A:  ((Oh, so,)) it was still a lot cheaper,
0 B:  No, no, no what I meant, not in quality, what I meant was,
0 B:  Uh, to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our
1 B:  Oh, that's exciting.
0 @A:  I agree.  
1 uh, they go out and shoot and they're from the mentality that when, uh, uh,
0 were just, uh, caught with them,
0 A:  Oh, no.  
0 robberies and holdups and things like that as you see here.  Uh, that's
0 A:  um, they have started where they do a background ((trick)),
0 people can sell it to one another,
0 offers a pawnshop guy some money,
0 B:  and, you know, maybe someday we're all going to get wiped out by a robber
1 B:  uh, with the husband being out at night and the wife hearing rustling at
0 A:  Well, um, my Dad and my brother both have a collection of guns,
0 A:  even to this day I don't really,
0 A:  I, right, 
0 B:  Yeah.
1 other guy's got a gun and fires when he sees his,
0 A:  His wife.  
0 B:  tend to, uh, uh, uh, uh, tend to do that and then, it happens in the, in
0 all kinds of guns, and he's taken her out to teach her to shoot.
1 he's out on police work, you know, he leaves her home alone and shows them
0 splintered wood from all the places that it hit going around the room.
0 B:  And, and, uh, so I, I, uh, I, I think we're almost coming from the same
0 protection.
0 trying to get rid of, you know, student loans, those kinds of things.
1 things, uh, we don't have a lot of, uh, you know, like J C Penny's in our
0 [laughter],
0 B:  and, uh, they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace
0 buffer that.
1 B:  Then maybe we'll go for a week or two, and, or a month or two, and then the
1 car breaks down [laughter].
0 actually we started two paychecks ago, and that was, uh, I think that was a
0 at schools, and, uh, there's, uh, so many school districts and schools here in
0 A:  you know, everyday, but, we're, we're just going to let her work one, maybe
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 them.
0 that, uh, we gave for Christmas last year.
0 A:  And she did really good with that.
1 A:  Oh, wow, wow. 
0 A:  and get them a whole new set of playthings.
1 B:  Now, I don't know how the dog has fared, eating all that plastic,
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  and, uh, and stuffed animal stuffing, but [laughter] he's still here.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 just loved it and,
0 B:  see, I took him and a friend t-, to see, uh, KINDERGARTEN COP a couple of
1 B:  You know, i-, it was so uninteresting that I don't even remember what it
1 was about [laughter].
0 B:  #The, the kids seemed to# enjoy it, and then, uh, let's see, uh, bef-, the
1 A:  Oh, was it?
1 B:  I mean, even the do-, it wasn't even worth a dollar [laughter].
1 A:  I see, I see.
1 said, I, you know, I just, I don't even remember it.
1 A:  Don't even remember it [laughter].
1 out awhile, it's kind of like, well, maybe I don't really have to go see it
1 told me not to see FLATLINERS so,
1 A:  Okay [laughter],
0 A:  STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
0 A:  Really?
1 pretty much prepared.
1 A:  Prepared [laughter]?
1 B:  I was prepared for that j-, I still cried, 
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  and I thought, well, it's not going to be that good, but I, I really did
0 the same impact.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  or, you know, ones that you really weren't sure if you wanted to see or
0 B:  I've heard a lot of good things about it, but I've also heard that it can,
0 A:  Yeah. #I bet that's true.#
1 commitment.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  But, uh, yeah, there are a ton of movies out.
1 B:  so, oh, I don't know now, if I want to see it.  Now, it's like, now I'll
1 probably wait until it's either at the dollar movie or #on video [laughter].#
0 A:  Uh, but it's about this, this guy that's a rodeo, big rodeo guy, and he
1 But, uh, I don't know yet.  I'll just have to save my money, I guess
1 [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  He's got little spots on them. 
1 A:  We have two Chows and, [throat_clearing], a miniature Schnauzer, and
1 longer have any other cats.
0 B:  but I, I wouldn't feel, um, hesitant about bringing a puppy in,
0 B:  Um, how, how old is your child? 
0 B:  Oh, I bet the black one's pretty. 
0 female mainly, and as luck had it, uh, she had puppies the same week my
0 A:  #yeah,# and that, yeah, I think that really helped and, um, my daughter,
0 B:  Yeah, I think it's good for kids to grow up around pets,  
0 you know, harm them at all and, and, and that's mainly people that have never
0 them.  We've had, um, in the past, we've had birds, too, uh, like Cockatoos.
1 B:  Are they?  
1 um,
0 beautiful,
0 A:  You know, you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a
1 B:  Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't dare have a, a goldfish here because,
0 B:  if the cats will, will jump up on things and knock things over all #the
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  let's take him home. 
0 A:  Oh. 
0 A:  Yes it is. 
0 B:  My cats do that it.  If I through anything away that's any kind of meat or
0 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  #I couldn't help myself.# 
0 it's wrong, you'll walk in the door and she'll cower and go hide under the
0 he's actually not really a puppy anymore he's like sixteen months old,
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else.  I guess,
1 )) like that [throat_clearing] and recently he changed the steering
1 so, he priced around and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so, he
0 B:  And so, I, uh, I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do
1 crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car
1 because we actually have winters here on the east coast, um,
0 to go, in Maryland they have, uh, emission tests.
1 the emission test, so.  You know, I had to do that job, and of course, that
1 A:  Right. 
1 long.  But then when he's finished he's, he always says, well, now you owe me
0 B:  Yeah.
0 something drastically wrong with it,
0 used by, you know, other members of your family, you know, you don't want that
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 muffler needed to be changed and, uh, he had looked at him himself and, but we
0 quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something.  Anyway, but the car
0 helped him to understand and be functional now, and it helped him to have a
0 nothing.  I mean, he couldn't even check the oil.  I mean, that's, that's how
0 willing to do it, I go ahead and let them do it.  I don't feel the need to,
1 B:  um, uh, when I left here, uh, she had to change a set of plugs on the
0 some other things but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it
0 car died on the highway and I happened to be with her and managed to get her
0 clutch cable had popped on my car, the clutch had broken or something I don't
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  And, um, that's a different subject, so, I better stay on cars [laughter].
0 A:  But the last problem I had with my vehicle was a, uh, fuel pump that needed
0 [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  But then the other problem too, is just a fuel filter and the fuel pump and
0 A:  So, always have a patch put on.  It's, it's happened to me twice and that's
1 enough.
1 own oil and filter but I got tired of that, so, I let somebody else do it
1 my Dad and the, uh, he was driving in fact, and the, uh, uh, stick shift came
0 out in his hand, (( )) driving down the road [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 uh, do you in, through their recommendation.
0 it be like fifty dollars, so, I thought, is that right, I don't remember that
0 B:  They, you know, they were kind of loose and so, but these people were
0 axle things in there.
0 A:  [Throat_clearing] Excuse me.  I just remember a seventy-nine Chevy Nova
0 B:  Yeah.
0 some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border and they are missionaries
0 minutes to get to their car and stuff, and uh, I know that they helped a lot
1 and stuff.  They have been down there about three years now, and they wrote
0 B:  The thing about it though is the Panamanians is, a lot of servicemen down
0 up.  Thousands of servicemen,
0 B:  got caught for running a drug ring. 
0 B:  But I don't know how corrupt the Honduran government is.  But the, 
0 of the different nations for all their, uh, you know the atrocities that they
0 commit and the drug dealings, and in the, just in the drug crimes, because I
0 He's an elder at virgo church and, you know that, that God is doing something
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 an American citizen.  They would not permit me to live there to work.  They
0 B:  They don't, they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries
0 higher, the higher people,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 building was destroyed and they were living in a tent, so it's kind of weird,
0 since that earthquake, because there's a lot of, you know there's a lot of sin
0 And yet, they are revered and honored and almost worshiped by so many people,
0 thirteen year old boy, and they hold it up to the sun God, and that's pretty
0 when you go there? Because,
0 lot of those, those you know, generational things I think, that God sees I'm
1 A:  And, uh, he has an M B A, so, uh, we were sort of, you know, keyed in on
0 A:  [Cough] Excuse me.  For instance, I control all the household expenses, the
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  And, uh, [cough] excuse me, if, uh, it comes the end of the month and I
0 A:  But, uh, we live, we live on, on a cash budget and it, sometimes it's tight
0 A:  Right. 
0 of thing?
0 twenty-five percent of our, of our pay.
1 A:  Neither of us had any help with our college degrees, and just this last
0 back I used to use ch-, uh, charge cards, and you know all the time, kind of
1 A:  That's good. 
1 A:  Oh, and it's not deductible anymore. 
0 A:  And it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up, you
0 A:  And, uh, I mean some months I may spend three hundred on groceries and a
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  And, uh, on special occasions, I mean birthdays and things like that. We,
0 A:  Well, no not originally, because when we, we did buy, when we bought our
0 rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your, you
1 A:  Sure, I know. 
1 A:  That's how I feel sometimes about my kids' education, I mean jeez, they are
1 one and four [laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Well, I know, but there are times when I sit there and I think, wow, you
0 B:  or something like that.  But, all those, just monthly payments and stuff
0 that just go out the door and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the
0 things that's gone, used and gone.
1 A:  That's, that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch. 
0 have seen the caricatures of Halloween cats?
1 A:  Are you keeping them? Sold them all.
1 B:  [Groan] Well, you don't know what you're missing.  
0 A:  Okay. 
0 A:  Wow. 
1 and laying down on the sofa and she gets up on my chest where I can't see the
1 back to sleep.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 follows you from room to room.
0 A:  Have you ever taken videos of her or something? That would be fun.
0 A:  Huh.
0 and she will come running.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, she's, she's sort of a weird one.  Why don't you go back to
0 B:  She's playing with the pins, uh-huh.  Why don't you play with the keyboard?
1 legs and great big paws.
0 A:  She pays Kitty Cat back for all the hassle. 
1 her and Sheba will just turn around and throw her to the floor.
0 on the street, but I don't think it's fair to the animals.
0 B:  Yeah, [throat_clearing] yeah, your best litter is usually your first one.
0 because when they go into heat their, uh, genetic parts swell up and expand
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  I have a tr-, treadmill, and a, a exercise bicycle, plus a dog I could go
1 walk.  [laughter] And a whole lot of things like that.
0 A:  because I,
0 you just have to be really, really careful about what you eat.  You can, you
0 B:  Well, you must, you must not have a weight problem at all.
0 A:  Twice a week.
0 B:  And, that's for an hour each time you go?
0 B:  So, but I, it was, I, I know how, I felt so tired last week and yesterday
0 know, it's too warm in this place where we go, and everything, and I'm
1 thinking, why am I doing this,
0 B:  Well, it sounds like you're, you're, uh, you know, got it, got it well in
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  If I had to go, you know, several miles, if it took me ten or fifteen or
0 B:  But some men, I guess, are not too comfortable doing that but,
1 to see if they stick with it [laughter].
0 who is really int-, I mean, she's very athletic anyway, she always has been.
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah.  Well, uh, it's too bad we can't talk about your other interests
0 B:  Well, keep up the good work and I'm going to, I'm going too.  I'm
0 trampoline, I said, I'll come over this afternoon and you can borrow the, the
0 A:  Well, yeah.
1 A:  and all sorts of things that I don't think, you know, we typically do.
1 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Me either [laughter].
0 came back they said "Oh, there's a parking space real close," and I parked way
1 B:  and I said "you can walk off your lunch."
1 A:  [Laughter]  That's the way to do it.  
0 B:  Oh.
1 A:  and, I thought, oh, this will be an easy class.
0 A:  and this has been a couple of years ago,
0 the class.
0 B:  Oh, no.
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  and, I'll go for like two weeks and go, this is for the birds,
0 uh, not the exercise but the walking program, uh, that I did tone up, you
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 know, when you come to your Nutri System meeting, don't park in the parking
1 place outside the front door,
0 surprised at how much just that little bit adds up,
0 that kind of stuff anymore.  I think having children everything just kind of,
1 mine either.
1 A:  I've never been, I just, I'm more into, you know, sitting, than I am 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  Me too.
0 B:  Uh-huh.

0 A:  Um, I've, I've gotten together sort of like basic recipes.
0 A:  yeah.  
0 A:  way I am.  I generally get there and --
0 B:  And then from that point you can pretty much improvise once you, once you
0 A:  I bet even my cats could do that.

0 B:  -- yeah, that, uh, 
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  it was sunny and forty-five degrees.  So, we couldn't a done much better
1 than that in Buffalo [laughter].
0 game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us.
0 started showing us another football game.  We did not get to see the end of
1 B:  Right.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  An-, because it was funny.  I mean everybody was furious.  I was
1 except the quarterbacks.  And the quarterbacks just didn't do anything.
1 B:  Yeah.  Well, (( )) that's the, that's the guy that counts [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, I, 
0 was in the background quite a bit.  Sometimes the baby was crying, sometimes 
0 A:  Okay, uh, I think maybe that we could do better with the budget if we
0 B:  Well, I don't know how much that would do for the budget, though.  I mean,
1 too.
0 little girl.  Which one [/baby_crying] should they do?
0 A:  to fight to get money to, 
0 B:  Yeah.

1 A:  Well, no, I don't know, I guess if we had the answers we'd,
0 B:  [Baby_crying] [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.  I know that.  You know, and then they cut the defense.  I, I'm not
0 B:  just so that I can have a job [noise].  I would rather have the, the
0 A:  do.  But I still hated to see it [laughter].  I mean,
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 right?
0 that's, that's the biggest increase in federal spending right there.
0 A:  So what's the answer [breathing]?
0 B:  There has got to be a middle ground.  I,
0 B:  Well, something's going to have to change.  But you look at the Congress
1 B:  [Baby]. 
1 B:  [Baby]. 
0 B:  [Baby].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 the insurance.
1 B:  Yes.
0 AIDS is AIDS as long as, if they tell you before they come here, that's fine,

0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 Koreans are taking over.
1 A:  And brought her home and, uh --
0 time they could have for everybody coming into the United #States.#
0 B:  #Nothing.  That's where# you problem comes in.  Is because some people will
0 economy is booming because of the United States {mispronounced}.  #If you
0 over here, they sell it for the same amount of American car.
0 A:  Well, you, you, you think, you think that's worse than, than having the
0 that, uh, that, that set up factories in Mexico and basically move jobs out of
0 Mexico.  I don't if it's in Mexico, Mexico but they got them in, in foreign
0 want to do.  
0 A:  Yeah.
0 Koreans.  That's why, uh --
0 A:  Yes.
1 A:  #Yeah.#
0 way they can make money.  Because they make money and then they put it right
1 my sister.
1 B:  #That's why,# now that works.  If you can find somebody to do it with but
1 it's very rare #that you can [laughter] find somebody to do it with.#
0 I like, just to get away, I go to my room and I like walk in, turn the radio
0 B:  But now, you know, I don't have a whole lot of time now but I have more
0 A:  Yeah, exactly,  uh-huh.  Like, um, we-, I have, I come from a family of
0 B:  Yeah, I, yeah, I just, uh, have, you know, one brother and he's married,
0 play it a lot when I was in school, but now that I'm married and stuff I, you
1 know I've like, I'm really bad.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yeah, I don't have a lot of time to read.  I, yeah, I remember in college,
1 I did a lot of reading, most of it text books, [laughter] so.
0 B:  And, just, you know keeping busy with everything else going on, so.  But
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 up and saying, will you make me another one and,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 and, uh, you know, accessibility of people to be able to break in.  I live on
0 about, uh, much more crime than ever before.
0 violent crimes.
0 remorse, what so ever.  
0 B:  the kids aren't getting the attention that they need, or the television.
0 B:  And I, I really think that we're, we're falling by the wayside with not
0 A:  Oh, I agree.  I think that people are getting off too easy.  They're
0 A:  Uh, that's terrible.
1 think a thing about it.
0 B:  And I mean, I think that what this is going to lead to is people will take
0 B:  That's it, we don't take care of them, we don't support them,
0 B:  But that's, uh, the-, they're, so close, I, I don't consider Mexican people
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  You know, whe-, we've advanced beyond that, and I think that their, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  It was amazing I went to the Far East, uh, back in October to do
1 just about guarantee that there, that, that would happen if you did that.  I
0 thought, boy, [laughter] in America, 
0 have.
0 B:  where, uh, you know, they plead to a lesser crime, or, uh, they plead
0 guilty in, or, you know, tell about someone else and they, they get less time,
0 they don't serve the full penalty.
0 uh, all this other stuff and trying to do a job and let's face it, what do
0 really sad.
0 brunt of everything.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Oh, okay.  Well, I have a ninety Honda Civic, and I'm ready to get rid of
1 wrecked, and so I bought a ninety, um, because I, I really liked my
1 for, you know, low maintenance, so.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  I mean, they just, they can rack up a, a hundred fifty K on them,
1 the American carmaker ((system)).
1 uh, uh, Ford T Bird before I got my Honda, and it was the worst car I've ever
1 wonderful car and then it got wrecked and, you know, I wouldn't even look at
1 around or anything I just said that this is what I want, [laughter], and I
1 B:  Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody el-, [laughter].
1 warranty but in the first twelve months that I owned it, it was in the shop an
1 average of about once a month, [laughter], it was in the shop about twelve
1 B:  ((Oh, really)), if you had a choice of your car, what would you get?
1 like to have a Mazda M P V van, [laughter], I really like those and I have
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Okay, well, that's probably influenced maybe ((a little bit)).
1 A:  Oh, yeah, [laughter], definitely.  But, I know that it's got to have a
1 A:  Um, living in Arizona, but, and cruise control and tinted windows, that's
0 don't care.
0 they're, they're pretty fun to drive, so,
1 A:  I'd like to have a sports car too, but it's not practical for me,
0 B:  Huh, anyway,
0 looking at twenty-five K or something,
1 B:  maybe someday [laughter]. 
1 B:  Okay. 
1 B:  I hope it's not my (( )), [noise], you there?
1 sporty and class, uh, so,
1 B:  And, uh, i-, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 limited edition, it's usually worth something later on.
0 B:  I don't know. 
1 A:  Now, see, I would have never figured that, I would have figured that to be
1 B:  yeah, #and the Mitsubishi,# 
1 B:  Yeah, well, that's, that's, 
0 B:  there is, yeah, big time. 
0 performance that the expensive one does.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Yeah, they're not really that bad but I don't know, [laughter] like I said
1 at cars like that because I think, now, there's no way I can do that
0 of them, uh, ((the gray)), I think that's one of the ones we've been to, it's
0 A:  What about you, where have you, uh,
0 A:  an area.  
0 B:  it's, uh, actually the, the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Are the temperatures real extreme there or the, the,
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  ((I've been)) camping in Death Valley, one doesn't go in July [laughter].
0 Colorado and the Grand Canyon area.  {Very faint} I don't know, don't know
0 been camping on the south rim the Grand Canyon.  That's okay.  A lot of people
1 A:  On A B C? 
1 station.
1 B:  What's your second favorite? 
0 around.
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  I just ((like)) I just finished watching that a few minutes ago,
0 that, ((because there's, there are)), I've noticed that every, every major
0 here so late is because they consider it a violent program.
0 wrestling to me, I don't, I don't see any difference though,
0 GLADIATORS is on Sunday afternoons actually around here as well,
0 it.
1 A:  But, maybe I'll try it one day.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Really? 
1 B:  Yeah, that's, you know, just minor. 
0 your prime time start at seven o'clock?
0 A:  Yeah, that, that would all start at, at, um, that would all start at, at
1 most companies and government agencies and, of course, that's something we're
0 B:  Right.  Um, #okay, go ahead.#
1 B:  Yes. 
0 enough though, I think they should, they should, uh, also test for alcohol.
0 A:  #But# it's not specifically tested for that. 
0 the more bulk that you have, you, you can, your system can tolerate more
0 their rights and, and, um, and it was not the people that I would have
0 just a super person in management, you know, and he's, he's very family
0 A:  And, uh, I, I think they don't go far enough, uh, kind of on a different
0 to rule it out.
0 people that have chronic accidents, and test those, you know, that's a start,
1 six, there's seven of us and there's only one been called.
1 A:  Well, I've been lucky, I've been called twice [laughter].
0 A:  And so I, I, I was once there and then in the general random sampling last
1 have, you know, I know, I, I mean, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do
0 B:  and even if they get a, a reading, I guess, they test the same sample
0 A:  Well, now if the lab is making on error on the sample then when they
0 A:  If they do,
0 B:  condemned, right?  
1 B:  Yeah, but I often won-, wondered about that too.
0 A:  if, if we're talking marijuana [laughter], 
0 B:  you know, something, they make a mistake, the lab made a mistake and it
0 really wasn't,
0 B:  We, we probably send to a different lab then you guys down there.
0 A:  Well, it seems like I don't have time for them, but I'm, I don't work
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  #sometimes.#     
0 burned out, I did too much, too fast,
0 B:  And I do enjoy reading,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  I enjoy reading novels and then, uh, you know, more serious stuff
1 A:  Oh, is it really?
0 A:  Oh, how old?
1 A:  this month ((say, yes)) [laughter],
0 B:  Oh, how exciting [laughter], that could, it's always,
1 B:  Well, that's good, you, that will be your new hobby then. 
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].
1 B:  So, but, I guess that's a little off the subject. 
0 to break into something new,
0 B:  that, um, you know, with my, I've got qui-, enough of an investment in my
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.
0 A:  we can hook it into our, uh, a vide-, or, uh, stereo system and, uh, put
1 B:  Oh. 
0 A:  We, we're real active in it for a long time but, you know, you get busy
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Yeah, I know. 
1 it.
1 B:  When's the baby due?  [Laughter].
1 B:  Is it her first one? 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  actually do the painting, and, you know, they've never done anything and
1 minutes [laughter],
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  my son and myself it's just not, to me it's just he, you know, I hate,
0 A:  That's too bad.  Was it lower back or,
0 A:  we have a lot of grass, takes me about four hours,
1 that didn't like to do it. I didn't want anybody in my garden, I was a grump
1 life sentence, if you have to do that, you might as well shoot them.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  As long as you got practicing lawyers in politics, they're going to rig the
0 B:  As far as hard line laws dealing with criminals, we don't have them in this
1 really in his normal frame, frame of mind.
0 penalty assessed is death, period.
1 executing him.
1 rather than, uh, actually, uh, dealing with the crime than with, uh, um, the,
1 not, uh, lawyers.  In the fact, and that's, wa-, way they've gotten into
0 which the regular jail sentence thing, they let them out because of, they
0 the ones that are going to pay and they are the one that are going to suffer.
0 And the other person, you know, if, if they, if they, uh, arrest them, uh,
0 either let them go or they get off with a, a sentence because they've had a
1 lawyer that, you know, feels that, that they weren't all together when they
0 did it [laughter].
1 themselves.
0 twenty-two because if you defend yourself, or as there was a case where this
0 B:  That's we're if you had judges that had any backbone whatsoever, they'd
1 they would just kill the dogs, you know, so, uh, it's, it's, it's wrong, your
1 A:  Oh, okay, so, it's just another job.  Uh, it must be especially frustrating
1 you're going to get knifed or something, uh, you know, as a guard that, it
1 B:  it's my favorite. 
0 uh, C D -s that I like, they,
0 some of the things he does.

1 A:  When you matured [laughter]. 
1 A:  They slipped that in on us,

0 day or anything.
0 parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the, uh, the
0 seats, you know because,
0 B:  when, um, he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of
0 B:  and if there's a game on, he's watching it.  I mean, that's all there is
1 A:  I'm glad my husband's not like that. 
1 waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs
0 B:  Twelve children?

0 only have one child, you know, they don't say, they don't put (( )) on bad or
1 always give her a hard time (( )) who's toothbrush did you really use this
0 B:  But how do they afford to even have the kids, uh, we're expecting our first
0 (( )) a whole in your money bag, we don't honor God with this (( )) portion and
0 company had ever done,
1 ((die or shop)) at Foley's so ((things)),
0 B:  I, I don't know what Foley's is [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah, well, that makes a really big difference.  But,

0 A:  Yeah, well, we're feeding starving kids overseas but we're not paying any
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And [sniffing], uh, it's just, it's got to start at home, is where it's got
0 Easter eggs out in the front yard for an Easter egg hunt for, you know, my son
0 Easter eggs Dena.  I called the police because I figured if these kids were
0 B:  Of course.
0 A:  they knew what they were doing was wrong.  That's why I called the

0 black.  And the little two year old sister she had with her, she patted her on
0 is it that you want.  Do you want me to pay you for your eggs or what.  You
0 B:  I, I've been lucky I guess.  I haven't had a bills big enough where I

1 A:  Well, I guess we've exhausted that one.
0 a, a not so widely publicized comment that said, just wait awhile and see how
0 and that country and breaking our own backs as it were.  What do you think?
0 A:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think over the, well, goodness I guess you

1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- music [laughter].  I never really listened to it because I, you know, I

1 A:  Okay [laughter].   
1 B:  [Throat_clearing].
1 [breathing] um, there were probably, like two or three styles you could choose

0 A:  are you close to Sevren?

0 A:  Yeah.   
1 B:  ((I would have thought)), 
1 A:  Wow [laughter].
1 B:  So, it's, uh,  
0 A:  That much of a difference?   
1 B:  Yeah, so,  
1 A:  [Laughter].   
1 B:  it's, it's really sad [laughter].   
1 B:  public employees make great salaries around here [laughter].

1 B:  Do you?  I drive a Honda Accord.
1 A:  Oh, yeah [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, me either.  I just bought mine, uh, it will be a year in August.
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  I have a standard.
0 B:  I hadn't heard that.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Did you?
0 years old.
0 B:  Really?
0 A:  other than the compressor.
0 B:  And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda but
1 B:  That's true.  
1 A:  and I anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever I decide to sell
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- a lot.
0 know, I just fell in love,
1 car.
1 largest impulse that I,
1 A:  other things that I bought on impulse are a V C R and a washer
1 [laughter],
1 A:  and dryer.  I go for the big stuff.
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Bye-bye.
1 B:  Okay.
0 B:  Um, well, not, not really from, you know, I really wasn't from here so, uh,
0 the teams I really root for in football are the Niners and the Seahawks, um,
1 A:  Yeah, it's, um, um, other than the, uh, the big catch, uh, with the
0 finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys --
1 when they're not doing well [laughter].
0 A:  And then about five years ago, four or five years ago, uh, they started
0 B:  #And# I don't, you know, my, my, my, my main sport is baseball but, you
0 B:  Um, I just, you know, um, Cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they?
0 A:  No.  Actually, they picked up some from Minnesota.  I think it was, uh,
0 hopes.  You,
0 B:  I know, I know in baseball, you know, any manager you go to say, well,
1 we're going to be in the World Series,
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  yeah, really.  
0 B:  Because they only won one game the year before, right?
1 B:  Okay.  Yeah, I enjoyed that because it was against the Skins.
0 much.
0 B:  Ye-, well, considering how, how well he gets along with, uh, Jimmy Johnson
1 that doesn't surprise me.
1 know, uh, was coach of the year and the second was this phone call from Buddy
1 Ryan, I got fired can you believe that [laughter].
0 A:  Um, no.
1 B:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's not far from where the, uh, the new football
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, they've, they've built a new stadium downtown, um, it's
0 old station and they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed
0 B:  So it's, um, real easy access from, from south of Baltimore like, um, like
0 for a couple of years and, uh,
1 A:  Oh, okay.  
1 B:  And, um, I was not real happy when, uh, when they, uh, left to go, go there
0 of all places [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, but it's close to Philadelphia and Baltimore,
0 A:  that's true.  I take it you're an east coast type guy?
1 B:  eas-,
1 A:  Okay.
0 B:  Dallas.
1 B:  And, uh, I, I got, I got married to a T I -er and the first thing my mom
1 A:  Really?  I was going to ask you if you've been out to Southfork.
0 B:  And they ha-, they even have a, a genealogy chart of all of the people who
1 A:  Uh.
1 B:  It was pretty bad because I understood all of it [laughter].
1 follower.  Maybe it's because, because I live here and I know how hokey it is
1 [laughter].  I don't know.
0 A:  I was going to say, there's going to be no more DALLAS reruns.
1 A:  Yeah.  Of course, they're, uh, they're probably going to set it up for some
1 on and all of the people were very familiar to me, and I'd seen all of the
0 A:  How about that.

1 B:  Well, he's got a lot of business smarts, though.
1 A:  Yeah, I know [laughter].
1 B:  That's funny.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, that's pretty, pretty strange.  Well, they, they've already said
1 A:  -- and we didn't figure you, you would come without him and, and we're
1 B:  They're married in real life.
1 A:  I know [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, that was kind of a bummer.  Yeah, it's interesting to talk about
0 recycling, um, I work for T I and there's a, uh, a lot of paper that gets
0 with, uh, trash pickup, where, uh, one day a week they pick up recycled items
0 in Baltimore City they've started doing it.  Uh, there's been a lot of

0 trouble here.
1 percent of the people polled considered themselves to be environmentalists.

0 there.  So we just said, hey, let's stop and --
0 B:  Uh, at this point.  
0 B:  But now that my, my, uh, youngest sister's at B Y U now, and so they have
0 same belief here that --
0 B:  yeah, you, it's, it's hard sometimes at work because, you know, people

0 **B:  It was cheaper to keep them empty --
0 out of their homes.  I know a lot of people who do.  Lawyers, doctors --

1 A:  So if the bank turns you down, well, that's it.  You're out two hundred and
1 fifty bucks [laughter].
0 A:  Uh, but if meet all those, chances are they'll approve you.
1 A:  So we're looking at that.  It's just, it's just hard to give somebody two

0 A:  -- and see how it worked.  And mine looks real good [laughter]. 
1 pots [laughter].
0 tomatoes --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 the city.  But, um, I went ahead and planted one, and mine looks better than
1 his [laughter].
0 B:  And then it's done, completely done. 
0 B:  Oh, yeah. 
1 I had a whole bunch of different kinds of things,
1 these, and I want to take these.  My husband finally said, Look, are we going
1 to take the grass? [laughter].
1 A:  Can we leave the grass? [Laughter]  I said, Yes, we may leave that. 
1 we're not taking that.
0 B:  [Laughter]  That'd be funny. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  But, I just couldn't see it, you know, going off and leaving everything
0 like that.
1 A:  -- there was nothing.  These people, we have one ugly pine tree. 
1 A:  I mean, and it is ugly. 
1 around it, and it was so ugly.
1 A:  Oh, it did not help, let me tell you.  I took it off and put it on my door.
1 A:  Now I like to go to the beach where the sand is, because then it doesn't
1 A:  But, one good thing about it, see I don't have to mow the grass or (( ))
1 [laughter], 
0 run it up a fence --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 the C E O -s tend to steal a little of that here and there, and then you get
0 keep throwing money at it, and,
0 seeing this violence, so much of it on T V and so forth in the movies.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 times and, 
0 B:  Get uh, get the schools, uh, corrected, to, to some extent.
0 some of their, their crime problems.  It made me wonder just how the outlook
0 getting out on their own and getting away from whatever, uh, family problems
1 nurse in an emergency room, and boy when they come home from work together,
1 situations.
0 B:  -- information.  
0 they have a mandatory drug testing before you hire in.  And, uh, I enjoy that
0 A:  What if they did it on their own time, and it still, you know, it stays in
0 that one comes back positive [throat_clearing] then they send you to a, uh, a
0 A:  Did you see that special about all these people that work on the road
0 that's,
0 somebody's putting a missile together and they, you know, mess it up, and, then
0 know, in our society that, that, uh, it may be up to the work place to help
0 we're getting that assistance.  Because in schools, you know, I, I would hate
0 hooked on it so that he'll start selling it or something, you know. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well, I teach, and last year a student that I'd had the year
1 B:  #cocaine type.#
1 A:  I don't, I don't know what it is [laughter]. 
0 B:  So.  #But I don't,#
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  -- like should I say postal service or not, are they going to screw up on
1 B:  Right.  Uh,
1 B:  I guess the only, the only concern I'd have,
1 A:  I don't know, it would cost so much money, and I think we could use that
1 B:  Um,
0 A:  Yeah, coliseum, Wally Moon and all that. 
0 And, uh, and, Wally Moon is the manager of them.
0 to, uh, going away to college, and I used to go watch the Toledo Mudhens. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Yeah, I think that's right. 
1 A:  Okay, yeah, so had a lot of fun actually, I mean, I like minor league
1 one of those in any, any given year.  So.
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  So. 
0 B:  Oh, okay. 
0 B:  Well it should be an interesting year. 
1 B:  Boy, you are a baseball fan, aren't you. 
1 A:  Yeah, I'll be, I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be
1 B:  No.  I don't. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Yes, I have, uh, one.  A five year old daughter. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Really?
1 B:  Oh, yeah. 
0 season's over.  But, uh, I really enjoyed being with her up there.  I hate it
1 A:  Um, gosh [Laughter].  I ca-, my husband and I both went.  We kind of give
1 her the third degree [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Uh, good [Laughter], 
0 specifically. 
0 B:  # your # decision?
0 A:  Either making her clothes or,
1 roughly two years, and she, um, she had to go back to work, they had some other
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # I # guess, kind of homey. 
1 A:  And that place, boy, if somebody came and she liked them and she went
1 outside with them and, it's hard to drag her away [Laughter]. 
0 B:  # That's, #
1 A:  # [Laughter].  #
1 A:  Exactly.  Exact-, I wanted,
1 A:  # to # quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months,
1 B:  # [Laughter].  #
1 A:  # because # I know she's going to have to face that [Laughter]. 
1 A:  # you know.  # I just hate that, but, [Lipsmack]  [Breathing]  anyway.  So,
0 you don't have any children.  Do you have any l-, nieces or nephews [Laughter] 
1 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a nephew.  He's a little brat. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  [Barking]. 
0 B:  Exactly. 
0 A:  Well, that's a shame. 
0 B:  # Which, #
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  And that's one reason I like working up there a little bit is,
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  You know, when their parents come,
0 B:  # [Laughter].  #
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  you know, I, that, I didn't base everything on that. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  [Laughter]  (( )).
1 A:  That's right.  That's exactly right.  You get some kids in there and it's,
1 A:  But, um,
0 B:  Really?
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  # Right.  #
0 guess ten year olds.  Isn't that,
1 A:  -- I'm, I'm probably a little too over protective [laughter]  but,
1 B:  # Uh-huh [laughter].  #
1 have kids of your own,
1 B:  # you'll # understand [laughter]. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 Speaker B's section did not match up.  Sometimes it sounded like one speaker 
1 B:  I don't think we have one. 
1 A:  I didn't know we had one either [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  But, but I guess most of the policy that we're using now is, uh, a
0 A:  Well, I don't think it's possible because, even though, you know, we're
0 B:  I don't know if they could do it or not.  Did you read Tom Clancy's A CLEAR
0 don't, nobody,
0 minute it hit, hits the paper then, of course, the Kennedys and the
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  don't want to piss them off and have them over produce and then, because
0 then our economy would be pretty bad.
0 B:  # Well, I think basically, #
0 A:  # be for nothing.  #
0 everybody else. 
0 A:  A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. 
0 A:  Well actually, what I do, I haven't been to a movie theater in probably
1 A:  Well, it depends, do you like, uh, steamy movies [laughter]. 
1 B:  Uh, no, not ye-, [laughter]  I know that sounds funny coming from a woman,
0 like LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO.
0 about movies #like DIE HARD TWO.# 
1 so many people said oh, no it wasn't, you know.  But I guess,
1 A:  Oh, [laughter] well I hope I don't run across them. 
0 A:  I, I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the
1 excited to go back.  I was ready to go back and see it again, you know
0 that.
0 like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. 
0 A:  Oh, you haven't?
1 B:  That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking
1 B:  So it'd probably be a good thing for me to see. 
1 A:  Yeah, it's really interesting it,
1 recently. 
0 wouldn't really talk about it.  Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't
1 the guys name.  But I like all the, the RAMBO movies. 
0 Sylvester Stallone. 
1 A:  Yo, Adrian {imitates Rocky}.
1 B:  [Laughter] Hey that's pretty good. 
0 B:  Oh. 
1 A:  Don't watch really very many horror films at all. 
1 the sofa to get you, or something, you know,
0 A:  #Yeah.#
1 B:  Oh, that was one of my favorites, yes. 
1 You know, I mean, and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it.
0 was really good.
0 it,
0 B:  No, I haven't, I don't know if I've even heard of that one. 
1 A:  #no it's got, uh,# uh, Cheech ((Marin)).
1 reverse. 
0 B:  Yes, yes. 
1 B:  #Yeah, it was.# TWINS was good too, because when I thought of that, I
0 home video [throat_clearing]. 
0 B:  Really. 
0 A:  And, or, not, not a friend, a cousin, a cousin. 
0 A:  #So, uh,# uh, but anyhow we got, uh, we got a nice, uh, picture and it came
0 would suggest seeing it at the theater.  I know that they're still playing it
0 B:  Yeah, this is actually a duplex that we're in,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 it's [talking] {background voice says Bermuda in the back} Bermuda in the
0 B:  It's the kind that has those, you know, grows sideways. 
0 B:  # It was very mild, mild winter, yeah [TV].  #
1 Dallas.
1 B:  # Um, #
1 mowing the lawn.
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # in # fac-, so Richland's on my west side.  When I look out my back door
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, okay. 
0 B:  # Okay.  #
1 the lawn, but I want to go out and run.  Now, which do I do first?
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 I'm going to get back and I'm going to be mowing the lawn and it's going to get
1 dark and I'm going to have to guess where, where the line is to mow. 
0 does, it limbers you up, so that you go out and have a good run.  I finished up
1 hour, for an hour and ten minutes or so. 
0 B:  # Oh.  #
0 mow your lawn?
1 days.
1 out and spend thirty or forty dollars a whack on fertilizer and then we bitch
1 and gripe about having to mow it so often [laughter].
0 B:  That's a long time. 
0 A:  Yeah, thirty-two years and my wife's a Texan, so of co-, naturally my
1 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  # But # they still think I'm a Yankee [laughter]. 
0 B:  And I, I was just taken aback by that. 
1 stand wore pinstripes suits and played baseball.
0 continue doing that,
1 A:  Well when we came back, what used to be our flower beds were solid Saint
1 B:  Oh.  
1 was immaculate.  He did a great job on the yard so, yo-,
1 A:  # so, # I guess you can't have everything. 
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 B:  And, uh, my sister sewed and she needed the money so I would pay her and
0 B:  but it's still such better quality that I think it's worth it. 
0 prices for them, you used to could get, you know, a pattern for two or three
1 A:  Oh, no, I'm not. 
0 B:  Well do you have kids and a husband, are you sewing for a whole family or,
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  And, uh, it would have helped me out tremendously [laughter]. 
1 at them and I think, God, you know, I, I should be able to do things like this
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 I got out of college.  So when we broke things off, I quit crocheting it and
1 I've never picked up a needle since then, in fact, I think it's still sitting
1 B:  One of these days I keep thinking I'm going to finish it because it would
1 you.
1 B:  Fast [laughter]. 
0 B:  And he says but Bev, I think you'll be so bored, because, you know, all
0 He kind of laughs [laughter]. 
1 A:  Right. 
0 B:  Well that's neat. 
1 might as well get some use out of it.
0 A:  No. 
0 B:  and my folks gave it to me, and, uh, a couple years ago when they, they
0 B:  I, you know, I've worked all day and I come home and I do that, I, and, you
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  I  don't want to do them sometimes, I'm too tired. 
1 B:  So, I try to save that for the weekend.  I need to get better at it though
1 then I didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it.
1 B:  and my mom wanted some pants, so she laid out the material and I cut it and
0 A:  Uh, it's kind of, it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine, like
0 with the Serger though.  You can make, uh, piping and cording and, uh, you can
0 machine. 
0 with it?
0 A:  # [Throat_clearing].  #
0 B:  # and # perhaps do the same thing again.  So, it really bothers me that
0 pay your Visa bill. 
0 pardons but I believe if it's a genuine conversion, there's a genuine, and those
0 prison people know, they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character, they
0 A:  # And, I, # I worked in a prison in Fort Worth. 
0 A:  # It # is obvious.  And they know that.  They're, they're not going to
0 B:  # punishment, # thank you, I'm sorry, I just got home from work and I'm just
0 foundation is still there, though, bu-, of the system, but, I know what you're
0 the law we've just been taken out from under, under a law.  Because under the
0 B:  # That's correct.  #
0 where we just have to, to trust the authorities.  And they're not going to
1 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 which would include, you know, you know, and expediting the penalties and just
0 B:  However, certain uh, very liberal minded groups who do not, um, subscribe to
1 that, and that's why, you know, I'm like, okay, what's my role in this thing,
1 B:  Uh, for world events I'll take C N N any day. 
1 ther-, there is a lot of people in our country that would go right off the roof
0 pack his own weapon again,
1 B:  concealed or unconcealed.  I'm all for that. 
0 open, I, I don't worry about carrying it concealed, I want them to know I'm
0 packing it. 
0 my area.  [breathing] Um, my roommate was attacked and she got away unharmed,
0 but scared to pieces and had had all of her clothing ripped off of her.
1 [breathing] to, to carry one or to feel [breathing] like carrying one would be
0 mean, that's, I, that's, that's truly how I felt.  I felt like if I were
0 accustomed to knowing, when I pull a piece out, whether it's a full sized
0 A:  #Uh-huh.# 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 {pause} that you may get them first.  And so, I believe in that, [breathing]
1 but I, I've not ever felt comfortable in it.  I guess it's [laughter], I'm
0 there's a blade already cutting them somewhere because they, {pause} they had
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  and, an-, and I think it's, you know, the voters don't feel like they
0 B:  so they, they kind of drift away because of that.
0 so many things to do, and we just couldn't get them done, and I, I remember us
0 topic, because there were talking about how the Congress, it pays the Congress
0 B:  I think that's, that's a good observation, a-, and true, yes.  Uh,
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Oh, what's the solution?  Huh.
0 B:  Start over again.  You know, that's, we've, the people have talked, you
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  We don't have, we don't have a little child, but I know that when you go in
0 through the state, but boy, howdy, man, these kids needed a whipping
1 control, so, that's, that's a good idea, there too, I like that but,
1 B:  Anyway, you know, have you ever had a two year olds twins start spitting
0 was, and that, that's exactly, of course there was only one of her, it wasn't
0 A:  Yeah, I did, I stood there, and I did take care of it.  It took forever
0 B:  Uh-huh, right.
1 LIVE.  We were the only normal seeming human people in the whole place almost.
0 A:  you know, 
0 just the things that happened, we had a bulimic in front of us, she just
0 looked crazy, but yet she had money.
1 eating his f-, eating their food.
0 A:  and he ate it all before they got back, and everything, and so, I just
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Okay, yeah I enjoyed it.  Thank you.
0 A:  Sure. 
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  That's right. 
0 situation arose. 
1 spider webs,
1 the worst of both worlds, communism and capitalism. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  #Right.#
1 A:  #I# mean, they talk about unification, unification, and now they're
0 B:  #That's true.#
1 B:  I think our next biggest threat is the Ja-, Japanese. 
1 A:  #and# I guess they, they feel a bit ashamed they've done so well
1 A:  Well here's the poor United States, they helped us get on our feet so let's
1 help them [laughter]. 
0 B:  #things# like that, I mean that's ridiculous.  That is only asking for
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  let alone other countries,
0 A:  Yeah, we're not too far behind [horn].  I graduated in seventy-one, so I'm,
0 for that, not, not just because I'm a, I'm a hard ass or anything.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 it's, I think it would be good for them, uh, it helps mature them a little
0 bit, and helps them understand the world, the way it really is.
0 B:  Uh, I remember, uh, I've, I've worked since I was, well, I started
1 I was smart, ran away and got married,
0 A:  And, and most of them aren't.
0 B:  Yeah, I think once, once kids get out and see how other people really live,
0 A:  You know, they, you know they need help, they don't have anybody to
0 A:  Yeah.
0 wouldn't have happened anyway, but it would have been nice if there had been
0 the, like the yard work and little repairs, and painting and stuff like that.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 things for the old folks around the neighborhood, and, uh, I know how it made
0 the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other
0 y-, the government's going to be limited. I, where are they going to get the
0 A:  and, uh, it was, it was a pretty neat little program.  We'd just go out,
0 loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing
0 couple with two kids would get under welfare, and what they would be making at
0 taking welfare.
0 A:  You had to do something.
0 along an interstate and pick up garbage.
0 A:  [Throat_clearing]. 
0 prison population has significantly increased I would say.  Um, our economy,
0 be.  To me, also, our nuclear family is not the same because more people are
0 A:  -- that aren't married --
1 nature, but, uh, I don't really want to either [laughter], 
0 A:  I agree there. 
0 older, it gets to your, you know what I mean.  I think the kids now are, are,
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah, because I think we're given more now, whereas you had to work
1 until they have to. 
1 A:  Uh-huh, that's an agreeable topic there [laughter]. 
0 is just advancing so rapidly that, and there's so much information available
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Do you watch L A LAW?
1 A:  Well, that's good, at least you're hitting the books, right. 
1 A:  I agree with your parents,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Is there anything else?
1 B:  What about in our work ethics?
1 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  -- including what's left of ours [laughter]. 
0 B:  Well, that's great.
1 B:  Oh, I don't blame you.
0 B:  You should get out, you should jog.  And then,
0 in class until it's like seven thirty at night, and she,
1 A:  Um.  
1 not much fun to be around.
0 B:  [Laughter] Well, you know, now, walking relieves a lot of tension and it's
0 caddy because, um, I have a very severe perceptual problem.
1 B:  And uh, I tried it a few time, but, uh, I can't get, y-, you have to
0 A:  Yes.
1 the walk with him and enjoyed, you know, uh, pushing the cart, or pulling it,
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  pretty limited.  And I guess maybe that might be the one reason that we
1 town, you know, after three laps around the exterior of this mall, they pretty
0 B:  Yes, yes.  I think so.  
0 A:  Well, I, I must get back to work.  Nice chatting with you.
0 A:  #Uh-huh [talking].#
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Well, I, the reason why I was thinking about looking at it is
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Not, not really interested [laughter]. 
0 had to have information about that person or, um, preparing some kind of
1 A:  #Uh-huh.#
1 A:  #Uh-huh.#
0 B:  #it's,# it's been a while [laughter] since I've read,
1 cry, the ending of it.
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
1 A:  Well, I like the classics too.  Uh, I think that there's a lot of books out
1 A:  #And,# or how to repair this or repair that in your own home.  I bought
0 A:  #type# books, which I use as reference and have been real handy.  But
1 which I have to work on, basically,
0 B:  #you know.# I mean, yeah, just light reading that are, I particularly like
0 it,
0 thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you, you
0 A:  #Right.#
1 really care much for T V at all.  I just,
0 value for,
1 books and, and, [throat_clearing]  because even if it's, like you say, it's
0 A:  That's good. 
0 uh, set an example for ours that, you know, that reading is, can, it can be
1 A:  Uh-huh.  I think so.  Well, I guess I'd better close now so I can,
0 teacher?
1 B:  Well, well, today, uh, when I got up it was twenty-nine degrees. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  That sounds more like our winter weather down here. 
0 A:  Oh, we had a frog strangler go sw-, sweeping through here, uh, yesterday
1 A:  Oh, I mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street. 
1 A:  Well, it's probably on its way up there.  It was heading north. 
1 B:  Thanks a lot [laughter]. 
1 A:  Uh, in between the thunder showers, yes. 
1 A:  You, are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open?
0 front came down and, uh, temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short
0 A:  Well, I, let's hope it, well, i-, if it's the same as what we had, at least
1 it'll be warmer. 
0 less than an hour.  It was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal
0 B:  Um-hum. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  I've, #
1 A:  a dog lover myself. 
1 B:  Well [laughter]. 
0 have a dog also.  My son brought me a little Lhasa Apso, uh, for my birthday

0 taking to the groomer's to have groomed either [laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  That's what I call home. 
0 When you,
0 consp-, I wouldn't call it a conspiracy, but, you know, if you really wanted,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Right. 
0 is have these, uh, uh, elections, uh, what do they call it when you can vote
0 A:  #Absentee.# 
0 A:  Yeah.  Plus,
0 do try to vote in every one.  But, uh,
1 ten percent of the people voting.  That's really so low, I'm amazed. 
0 B:  You're voting for president.  Uh, why is it so sacred to have it on
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 vote.  It is still amazing.
0 B:  Of course, we, we don't have such a wonderful history that, you know, we
0 didn't allow Blacks to vote, uh, and we didn't allow women to vote until, I
1 B:  Yeah, I think you've got to have a good fight, you know.  You have to have
0 game, which means you want to see a close game, you know.
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Yeah.  Yeah, it is surprising how, uh, uh, even with low numbers, uh,

0 B:  # You're right.  #

1 A:  Okay, it does sound like you have some children to take care of [laughter].
0 and freeze it.  And, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's

0 B:  Before it got too hot. 
0 A:  Well, there you fish mornings and evenings. 
1 A:  And nights. 
1 B:  And it was twenty-eight, twenty-nine degrees.  We were out in this silly
0 B:  # That's cold water around there.  #
0 A:  # out there, and # you know how it is.  The water's kind of,
1 A:  # the # next thing you know, your knees are wet. 
1 A:  A fuzzy little dog. 
1 him a little pole last year, and just put, uh, his big thing last year was
0 hundred yards or so and let him fish. 
1 A:  Yeah, you guys sure want to be out of range. 
0 Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time.  And we still had a good time out,
0 B:  Kathy and Kevin Guy. 
1 about three feet away [laughter].
0 because there was so much, and if you were there.  I mean, it was, one time we
0 probably until about the ten o'clock news.

0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Uh, uh,
1 A:  Well, um, I don't know what to say [laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Yeah, that's true. 
0 A:  I would think they could find a better way to fund it though, but they
1 mean, it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state
0 A:  I, I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that. 
1 A:  Trying to think what else is current. 
0 A:  -- and the Kurd refugees. 
0 B:  On the,
1 A:  Yeah.  I'll bet. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Hm. 
0 A:  Goodness. 
1 A:  Yeah.  It's a lot more humid down that way. 
1 B:  # Goodness.  #
1 B:  Okay.  I'm, uh, we're not that, we're not that big at dining out.  But, uh,
0 economy and, uh, you know, a nice enough atmosphere that you can carry on a
1 know, that's a little better than home and all.  But,
0 A:  Oh, yeah. 
1 B:  that, that's the kind of place that you take the kids to [laughter]. 
1 A:  Well, I'd go there [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter]  We've got, we've got to look around here. 
1 B:  especially  when you have kids. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 well, we, if we're going out to dinner, we can drop the kid off at my folks,
0 A:  Yeah.  There's, um, there's a place, I live just outside of Baltimore, in a
0 A:  And, uh, there's a seafood place here called the Crab Shanty that's really
0 A:  the trendy section of Baltimore. 
1 not a big seafood fan.  So, you know, it's like great, we go,
1 A:  to the  Crab Shanty, and I'm going to have veal, you know. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  So wha-, what's eating out cheap for you? Is McDonald's or something like
0 Delaware.  And there's a place up there that we like to go to called, um, The
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 wall, and there's like, uh, like a relief of the, of, of the guy who Ralphie's
1 A:  And it turns out he used to work for the Orioles. 
1 B:  Oh, no kidding? [laughter]. 
1 A:  And she's like, No, not more baseball! [laughter]. 
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  you know.  My only big gripe is every time I've gone to Silver Diner, I
1 A:  Oh, sorry [laughter]. 
0 in Texas, we'll go to a place and the big thing is frozen mag-, margaritas.
0 margaritas in, I don't know, do, do you ever go to Howard Johnson's? In, uh, I,
0 A:  Yes, I've seen them. 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  CiCi's, they, they have CiCi's down here,
1 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  Well, I, I, I would, I mean, you know they've got them out here because
1 it's, you know [laughter], 
1 A:  they don't actually know what Mexi-, you know, what Mexican,
1 B:  Yeah, uh, [laughter] yeah.  
1 gourmet.
1 B:  And everybody, I say I went to Pancho's, they all down at me, down their
1 taken to a real fancy Mexican restaurant there, called Senor, something
1 A:  Senor Pico, or something like,
1 A:  that.  And, you know, I hated everything. 
0 A:  I, um, I like Chinese and I should experiment more.  The problem is, that
0 my favorite food in the world is cashew chicken.
1 try to, uh, you know, try something else, you know, something with a little
0 A:  you know, it's a big, you know, container full, Kung Pao chicken,
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Yeah.  That sounds great. 
0 A:  Um.  
0 A:  oh,  I'm, you know, I'm not a big French,
1 A:  you know, I,  I don't eat,
1 A:  Yeah, well.  I also, I also don't do snails so,
1 going to happen.
0 you're talking about it, and the re-, the other fifty-seven minutes you've
0 B:  Out of each child.
0 B:  Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction, I mean it's great
0 A:  Yeah.  That's,
1 B:  Everything I learned about ancient Rome ha-, has not helped me anywhere in,
1 B:  my adult life.
1 college right now, and I feel like, I mean, I'm taking this history class.
1 getting, you know, a computer science degree or whatever, you know?
0 B:  What, what type of history class is it that you're having to take?
0 A:  Uh, American History.  We have to take, um, like this is like early
0 A:  Yeah.
1 on him as anybody else.
0 B:  If not more.  The man was not a saint.
0 table, but a desk in this closet, and they had to sit in there by themselves.
0 mean, if a child has, uh, claustrophobia, I mean, that's just going to terrify
1 overcrowded?
0 were, uh, I mean, I definitely agree with parents.  I think that is a very
0 were, they were call-, they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation
1 what good does thi-, I mean, how is this helping?  I mean, either way.
1 is, that's not the way to handle a child, you know, discipline a child by
0 putting him in a closet [laughter].
0 lev-, the public school system I want to see changed too.  When I was br-,
0 rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked.  So, they're
1 just the John Q citizen out there on the street?
1 it, you know.  But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being
1 some kids don't get don't get spanked at home and some kids need to be spanked
1 B:  I, m-, m-, most wholeheartedly agree.
0 B:  Need that shock effect, where they equate the shock of being spanked with
0 A:  The, uh, whole savings and loan thing seems to be, uh, a bit of a system
0 that California was the instigator of it, but it seemed to start out that way,
0 something.  But, uh, Texas, is on, basically on the way to recovery as far as,
0 uh, the banking industry goes.  And, uh,
0 going the same direction that the savings and loans.  Primarily because, uh,
0 anything, you eventually reach sort of a plateau where, you've overbuilt if
0 capital to keep us afloat, you might say, hoping to make a buck off of us in
0 terms of what we are going to have to pay off all this debt with to foreign
0 B:  And, uh, I'm glad to hear that you, do you know, uh, how, uh, they're
0 the seventies.  And,
0 the bad loans.  And basically it's been a good weeding out process.  There's
0 business.  Uh, so, you know, you, you have some, all your bank failures that
0 A:  Yeah, and that's pretty well leveled off and, and, uh, that's,
0 B:  Oh, you think two years? I, I would have guessed five to ten but,
0 back you want to go.  Let's say if you went back ten years, and said here's a
0 was in Georgia or someplace.  Uh, what, what, what, how do see that this, this
0 It's hard to get a feel for what's going on in a nationwide, uh, system like
1 A:  and a son, seventeen, who's a senior in high school.
1 was, um, we go on fishing, you know, day time trips with them.  The younger
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  gee, you know [laughter].  Uh, well, we don't have enough time for that.
0 B:  Uh, oh [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, my,
1 A:  Dad, do you remember that sixth grade team we had that year, Dad?
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].
1 doing activities with the kids.  And I think a lot of times the parents
0 that, uh, American families are spen-, spending enough time with their
0 recognize that yes, a, a lot of families need two incomes.  In fact my wife's
0 programs,
0 A:  Uh, is that it's the concept was that, I think it originally started with
0 projects, and,
0 homes, have to pour-, uh, uh, have to provide refreshments and they've got to
0 B:  see.
0 this program went on maybe for thirty years or so.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 start getting into trouble.
0 both of the girls first.
1 has, has hoarded all the movies.  And so,
0 freshman in college this year, her last couple of years in high school, she
0 nineteen people and,
0 A:  was an engineer, and she was a computer programmer.  But she went to work
0 B:  I think that's, uh, uh, part of the problem now.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  was kind of difficult because that concept, when you get into professions
1 up on.

1 A:  Yeah.  Who has spare time [laughter]?

0 B:  But see, I don't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway.  I think
0 B:  # You know.  So,#
1 A:  that, we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste,

0 A:  # I think so, too.# 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  # Huh.  #
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 two years unless we cut back.  And,
0 A:  So, what, you know, and n-, no other state, I'm sure Texas probably still
1 garbage here. 
0 A:  # realistically, you know, # we had, we really had to start, we have to
0 recycle your oil. 
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Um, I don't know how cost efficient that would be, I guess,
0 A:  That one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water,
1 B:  Yeah [breathing]. 
0 B:  Yeah.  I know [breathing]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Yeah.  I,
1 B:  # know.  I mean, # I don't know, I think a lot of people still will, but
0 [laughter], 
0 the Honda, which is the [children] older vehicle, I try to do as much as I can
0 on that.  On our newer one, uh, uh, mini vans, it's all electronic and
0 computers and everything in it.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Still, still under warrantee, right?
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Not everything's covered by [laughter] warrantee.  I don't try to mess with
0 A:  Do you do any, uh, body work on the Honda?
1 Honda manual when I got your call.
0 B:  Right, right.  Not the, things I know how to do.  I, I'm not an expert.  I
0 A:  Yeah, I just do what I can.  I don't really, you know, I don't, it's like
0 B:  But I think a lot of people learn how to do maintenance from whether their
1 wrong and I'll say, and I'll say, Oh, it'll be this much money and I'll say,
0 A:  Right. 
1 A:  -- that needs to be precise and it's controlled by computer.  I figure I
0 B:  Right.  That's how I figure on those things.  It's just not worth the,
1 A:  Just as long as, as, like you were saying it's not too hard to take apart
1 calling all the neighbors and stuff trying to get them to give me a ride down
0 that we have two cars, I, I'm not, I'm less leery about just going for it.
0 A:  Have you had any body work done on your car?
0 B:  Yeah, I know.  I had an estimate for that little rust spot and they wanted
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 going to run me five hundred bucks. 
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
1 A:  Right. 
0 B:  Right.  Well, the mechanic doesn't see that, you know.  It's the owner or
0 you planned on, and it says, a new garage, second car, and then all a sudden
1 have it towed somewhere or something.  You just got to [noise] got to make a

1 A:  Okay.  Well, you're probably more interested in THE SIMPSONS, then. 
0 B:  No.  No, not really. 
1 A:  Oh, I'm in Texas. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  So the only time I ever catch anything is if I come home a little bit home
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  But, you know, that's, they tend to arrange, though, the topics seem to go,
1 A:  I can't say it's not entertaining, though. 
1 [breathing]. 
1 [laughter]. 
1 A:  No, I'm not too interested in that myself. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  I was glued to the T V for two, two weeks. 
1 back to the T V,
0 B:  Oh, really?
1 A:  # It's been very entertaining.  I'll have to catch # FULL HOUSE one of
1 these times [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter]  Okay. 
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
0 B:  #and,# and they're really quite, uh, arrogant about it all.  They, they
0 A:  Yes there's quite a bit of crime. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, we can't get involved in their civil war, um, unfortunately,
0 feelings, he, uh, agreed with, um, the General Schwartzkopf, he said, um, he
0 A:  Well I think the war ended too soon. 
0 your house they were going to take you and beat you.  Of course, you're going,
0 world could have given them some type of aid.  It's, it's just so complicated.
0 B:  Oh, yeah, well, you, knowing them, they're very, um, oh, I don't know,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 finished watching, uh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape, you know
0 [laughter].
0 B:  Did you like it?
0 B:  How about GHOST?
0 picture. 
1 A:  # oh, # it was great. 
1 everything and there's one really bad scene where it's, I mean, there's not
1 B:  # Okay, yeah.  #
0 A:  # a little, # a little on the nutso side. 
1 B:  How about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
0 so expensive.
0 A:  Ye-, well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really
1 B:  No. 
0 B:  Uh, part of it, I,
0 he's, I think he's very interesting and, uh, I liked those two movies of his a
0 B:  Whose your favorite actress or actor?
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  # Oh, really.  #
0 A:  Oh, okay. 
0 you seen NO WAY OUT?
0 A:  Yeah, it was on, um,
0 B:  # Cable? #
1 is. 
1 A:  He's, he's just, I, I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every
1 A:  No, no, you're thinking of Rick Moranis.  He looks like Rick Moranis but
1 he's not [laughter]. 
0 B:  How about some of the ads, do you go by the ads when you look at them, or
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  We just rented, um, a couple weeks ago, a movie called THE
1 B:  # next # thing you know, it's, it's especially if there's commercial in it
0 A:  Ye-, of the three of those, DINER's probably the best.  I mean, they're,
0 A:  Uh, late fifties, yeah. 
0 was always the home team, kind of like Dallas is around here. 
0 B:  #keep# it going. 
0 perform, uh, we hope, every team hopes their current quarterback is going to
0 close to it.  They'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the
1 end. 
0 B:  [Laughter] So who's going to beat them? Who are they going to blow it to?
1 B:  Yeah.  I'm sure, you know, my sentimental favorite would have to be
0 Philadelphia, but I, I sure am scared of them Giants [laughter]. 
0 A:  And it's funny, you know.  You like to pull for the underdog and for a long
0 B:  L A you mean?
1 A:  I mean L A, sorry. 
0 A:  Oh, yeah?
0 that much up in the mountains, you know, just west of there.
1 A:  Yeah, I, I would qualify the U S government as,
1 B:  Yeah, the benefits are strange.  They change every day and, uh, you don't
0 A:  No matter who your employer is. 
0 out, uh, I, what I perceived as the benefits were just eroding. 
0 A:  #Yes.#
0 B:  #and# I always thought that that, that was a big ripoff.  Uh, but still. 
1 A:  And we won't mention any names. 
0 B:  You're right, you're right. 
0 says you have a temperature, well I knew that.  I am going to give you
0 A:  Yeah, exactly. 
1 A:  Are you covered? Yes. 
1 A:  Are you covered really? No. 
1 a little note to my, my return when I sent it in saying, Gee, I didn't know I
0 about everything Washington can do what they want to do. 
0 bear arms. 
0 @B:  Okay, do I still can-, still can feel that the Soviet Union, as such, is
0 during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group. 
0 B:  # when # my first real involvement with the military started.  Um,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 advisors.  And the equipment we were capturing and taking from the
0 the Patrice de Lamumba University.  About like A and M or U T, where they're
0 generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops.  That irregardless
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 are in positions over some of these Soviet states.  If uprisings hap-, happen
1 A:  Oh.  Yeah, definitely.  I, I'm, I'm a little bit shocked to what the U S
0 weapons.  Especially when it's to the south of us. 
0 B:  You mean, I understand when they pulled the troops out of, uh, or they
1 when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much
1 B:  #Boring.#
0 A: #boring.#	 [Laughter] But I have head phones, and I, plus I have
1 B:  [Bird_squawk].
1 A:  or we have a fish tank, so I watch the fish, you know. [Laughter] Whatever
1 and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not
1 B:  You think so?
0 B:  I bought a stationary bike, but I find that if I sit [bird_squawk] on that
0 A:  Yeah, yeah. 
0 A:  Really? 
1 a health club.  Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people
1 at home and, uh, I just feel conscious about it.  I mean, I'm not big, you
1 B:  Uh, 
0 B:  feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have
0 staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing.
0 A:  Do they have a pool or what is, 
1 A:  When you're in the water?
1 bottom #because,#
1 your toes, you start getting blisters anyway.  So no big deal.
1 to do it at least three times a week.  Which I don't feel like is enough, but
0 I have to force myself to do it, like I said, because to me, I really don't
1 enjoy it.  But I know that I have to do it.  I mean it's just, it's, it's not
0 A:  But,  
0 there by four thirty, every night.  And the only thing that ever bothered me
1 B:  #I enjoyed it# higher.
0 B:  It's like I can walk, but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's
0 A:  Wow.
0 benefit, so it was, it's less than what you pay now for going in there,
1 swimming pool, and I go into the hot tub.
1 B:  And I love it.
0 B:  It's fun.  It's fun.  Uh, I've gotten on the bike.  And they've got, uh,
0 B:  #And I've# enjoyed that, watching how well I can walk up and down stairs.
1 A:  I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike, but I got
0 A:  Um.
0 do.  Because I jump on the bike here at home.  Mine has its, see, the handle
0 bars go up and down,
0 it, right?  [Laughter].
0 don't know if, you know, I was eighteen or whatever, I'd want to be stuck
0 but when I was, uh, in high school, it was the beginning of Vietnam and so
0 A:  Well, I guess it would still depend on how, I mean, if, if you're talking
0 about any-, if you're talking about something that's like a full time, you
0 B:  I could see a, a full, a run-, a gamut of different kinds of opportunities.
0 B:  Something that they turn,
0 A:  Well,
0 A:  Uh, definitely.
0 B:  It might not be the same neighborhood, but the same city or county, because
0 then you're, you're coming in contact with it.  It's not as meaningful for me
1 A:  Yeah.
0 want to deal with the, with the heartache of, first of all, getting it started
0 B:  -- And I guess, I don't see, uh, this being that different.  But even more
0 A:  Uh-huh {pause}.  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh, well good.  Th-, you'll have a little time think about that.  I guess,
0 B:  I know you've got to get past that, that grudge attitude that many have,
1 they, uh, the local chapter of the K K K wanted to, uh,
1 A:  uh, to participate in it and, uh,
0 A:  Should these people be allowed to or not?  I think they finally decided not
1 to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed
0 visited relatives in Virginia, not too long ago, and I thought I had seen,
1 B:  I see that as being,
0 everyone's consciousness.
0 B:  that you, one might care to bring up.  But, it is comforting to me to
0 B:  That's, that's right, because,
1 A:  Of course, that's probably blasphemy for you to say, uh, coming from where
1 you are [laughter] in Texas.
1 A:  You know, we're acutely aware of a lot of this.  But, you know, on the
0 B:  uh, makes, um, uh, decisions that I just can't go along with.  But that's
0 B:  Because, uh, my father and I, in like back in eighty-three, we went, uh,
0 B:  And we said, okay, let's just sleep in and try to get there tomorrow
0 A:  #potable.#
0 B:  Yeah, yeah. 
1 in the morning.
1 A:  That's right [laughter]. 
0 is sacked out.
1 uh, water thing.  And of course I got sick. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 and where are these guys? And they were off, both off a week, sick. 
0 anything down,
0 right? And, uh, but, uh, that was probably the last big camp, that's probably
0 anything real big. 
0 canoe camping.  And, uh, and I've, I've done a lot of canoeing, but never have
0 A:  #stoves# and everything in.  And all you have to do is just, you don't even
1 A:  #it's,# uh, it's, it, uh, you don't have to put very much effort into it. 
1 And, uh, boys, I guess as I get older, that'll get more and more [laughter], 
0 B:  #honey# and, uh,
1 and, uh,
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
0 B:  Bye-bye. 
0 B:  I heard the beep. 
1 @A:  All right, we're on.  Uh, hey, Rick, who's your favorite team?
0 A:  #Well, I  imagine# they're just starting. 
0 A:   I  went to graduate school in Pittsburgh, so I became a Pirate fan. 
0 guess I enjoy watching guys when they were very first starting out, playing
1 A:  uh, they get to the other end of their career, and now they come up and talk
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  #Okay.#  
0 A:  Well, I think the Phillies picked up some good players in the free agent
0 A:  didn't  they?
0 B:  #Yeah.  Well, have you heard,# 
0 B:  #Right.#  
1 A:  #And# ap-, apparently his, uh, his come back just didn't #make it
0 [laughter].#
0 #be careful,#
0 Series and Hershiser won all those games in the World Series.  #That
0 was, that was really a,#
1 A:  I was really, and boy, I can still remember that #Kirk Gibson,#
0 B:  #Um.# 
0 A:  #Uh-huh.# 
0 B:  #Yeah.#
1 here with two out in the ninth, with a, uh, #fifteen to three lead.#
0 B:   #Right.#  
0 B:   #Huh#.  
0 A:   to  be during the summer.  Uh, last year, we got to go out maybe about a
1 A:   #about eight# straight wins.  And we happen to go out there #on win night
1 [laughter].# 
0 A:  And, uh, the, the park holds about forty thousand people.  And, uh, I never
0 B:  #in Durham.  They're, they're# thinking about moving it to Raleigh. 
0 A:  Oh, that is great.  When I got, here  in the class triple A #Rangers,#
0 B:   #Yeah, they,# 
0 B:   #Yes.#  
0 course, you recognize the minor league team exists for the purpose of the major
0 #ball park,#
0 B:  There may be an A M station that does it, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. 
1 B:  #I mean, you could, the game could be# at seven thirty, at seven fifteen and
1 @A:  Okay.  Well, I'm going to tell you what I'd have [laughter]. 
0 B:  Oh, it sounds fantastic. 
0 like your rice steamer,
0 A:  And you put a little bit of that over it.  Now if you use the dried kind?
0 A:  -- of bowl that would go in the microwave. 
0 B:  I see. 
1 A:  It is good. 
1 A:  -- looks like it, you know [laughter]. 
0 B:  So it's hard, uh, you, you just have to pick something, for the, the group
0 B:  And, uh, they're big on finger food here, too.  You know, chicken wings
0 A:  Yeah.  Have you ever had crawfish?
0 know, even if it's like, out of town guests and stuff, they want our cooking.
0 A:  -- exactly.  I mean, it's got a taste of its own, you know, but it is,
0 B:  #Does,#
0 uh, it looks like, more like a cross between, uh, a crab and, uh, and a
1 B:  Yep. 
1 A:  And we call them mud bugs [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  Yes. 
0 B:  It is so good [laughter]. 
0 B:  Now how do they do the blackened?
0 B:  I did have.  I don't have it now.  But I have mostly Teflon. 
0 A:  #I guess you# could cook it in, in that too, but I don't know.  You know,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  #Oh, oh,#
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
1 B:  Oh. 
0 pizzas, and, you know, roasts, and that kind of thing.
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  And, uh, we're only going down there for the food, though [laughter]. 
1 cooking the stuff, you know, while we were, we went on this boat ride.  And
0 And, uh,
1 A:  #In# fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't. 
0 vote for things.  I mean, we have these initiatives, state initiatives now. 
1 that, they said we don't want to have to decide all these things,
1 vote. 
0 B:  #It's a duty, right.#
0 A:  I don't know, but part of me rebels against that,
1 B:  it's complex question when you start thinking about it, isn't it
0 B:  #I told them if they don't# vote they don't have the right to criticize. 
0 well you leas-, you least tried and you can say something but if you don't
0 true for but for the population as a whole, I sort of feel that way.  When
1 B:  I think it is too.  Sometimes it is a difficult choice.  You don't feel as
1 Australian system works. 
0 have both, I mean, you know, and I believe in the, in a certain, uh, Soviet
1 right to write your,
0 A:  #Yeah, but technically people, most people,# technically it's a privilege,
1 B:  That's right. 
1 A:  Um, so, gosh, so we don't have a great solution yet do we [laughter], 
1 B:  Don't have a great I, [laughter]  I think I checked that as a question I'd
1 be willing to discuss too [laughter].  Oh. 
1 informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy,
1 I agree, except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote
1 [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter]  Sometimes I think we have that right now, with Congress. 
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yeah.  But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, um, they could, uh,
0 B:  -- on-, one liter bottles and, um, I, I think it's kind of generational.
0 Although I must admit that, that I am not, I ca-, I'm not conversant in
0 A:  #Yeah.  It, it's,# like I say, I work in a machine shop and, uh,
0 A:  Yes.  it is a mental thing.  It is a conversion thing.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  And both of them were a mismatch of both {pause} American and metric.
0 three two inches, whe-, when you're milling something, #uh# --
0 A:  Right.  It's it's not a problem either way.
1 A:  and, and, you're never quite sure, well, is that a metric bolt.
1 A:  Right, right.
0 be. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Now that makes, you know.
0 drams for perfume?
0 B:  [Breathing] Yeah.  But, but are, are the tools that, uh, if you're
0 one tenth indicators --
0 B:  But whe-, you, when you, when you simply drilling a hole, I mean, a real
1 A:  And, uh, what I usually do on the weekend is, is lay out five outfits and,
1 uh, on Monday I, I wear the, the worst looking one [laughter]. 
0 B:  Like, um, in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button
0 or something like that, so.
0 guess it's more like a, a college campus also, I mean there's hundre-, you
1 time and they dress up like when customers are coming in,
1 A:  # So # there's a good combination in the hallways all the time, you know
0 computer engineer. 
0 B:  But, uh, I mean, they, they just moved into the new building, he calls it
0 B:  # and # he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of
1 there with the that attitude, well if I don't take it then they won't make me
1 wear it [laughter]. 
0 B:  But I think that's great about T I, and also, uh, to get off the clothing,
0 and you don't smoke, you almost strangle. 
1 A:  # I used to burn # my clothes, talking about getting back to clothes
0 B:  See that's how, that's how I am but my mamma was not raised like that and
1 A:  # Sh-, she'll buy a lot of, #
0 A:  sh-, yeah, she'll buy a lot clothes, at the end of seasons, you know,
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  Right. 
1 B:  Yeah, it, it depends on, um, yeah, there's, there's always a reason why
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  But, um, well,
1 A:  Like I bought, I bought the most beautiful swe-, uh, sweater from, uh, I
0 plain, a plain, uh, ro-, you know, round, uh, necked, uh, sw-, sweater. 
0 A:  And it had, like, it was embellished around the, the top, you know, it had,
1 A:  And it was so pretty, and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why,
1 you know. 
0 B:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Well, there, there's been some interesting stuff going on locally, but I
1 A:  Yeah, oh, oh, gosh, we really did support it, I mean,
1 A:  #just because# we wanted to impeach him doesn't mean anything. 
0 B:  Well that's true, but I suppose it's hard to judge from the eighties
0 my information about him. 
0 they're such a diverse party. 
0 B:  Instead there's so much,
0 A:  Yeah, and, and I, wonder, you know, if, if that's, I mean, that real, that
0 A:  Yeah, well, you know the re-, Republicans have always been weak on, on the
0 A:  #and, I# mean, it was terrible.  It was absolutely terrible.  Prices are
0 A:  And, uh, you know, it was ju-, it was a pure disaster because the way it
1 A:  #they# showed the picture of Dukakis to people in Massachusetts, only
1 twenty-three percent could recognize him as governor [laughter]. 
0 guy.  He,
0 emphatically come out and said no way. 
0 B:  #Uh-huh [dishes].#
0 B:  Well, it, uh, uh, I'm, I guess I'm the, I'm cloudy on the timing but there,
0 only, the only reason at the time that I could think of was that he was young
1 something.  But the guy is so uncharismatic. 
1 well that's how, how I think of Dan Quayle as broccoli, you know. 
1 B:  at the same time.
0 B:  Well, I'm not sure that we're going to be able to, uh, solve much of the
0 unseasonably warm and you could see the smog just sitting on top of the city.
0 like, like L A does.  
0 air, and there you are.
0 already. 
0 A:  But ozo-,
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah well it's like our winter here, I mean, it was the winter that
0 A:  You know, we were having, having hot days in December and January and got
0 B:  And at the same time I, I see some colder winters in the Midwest.  I think
0 B:  Well it may have been, uh, the fact we had this early season warm spell,
1 just a couple of scientists trying to get their name in the paper.  Sort of
1 my lifetime. 
0 the weekends nights. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 aren't that close to everyone in South America.  I don't really know why
0 Americans regard the United States as, as bullying.  And, uh, that's certainly
0 citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans. 
1 B:  #And they can stand on# their heads if they want too,
0 A:  #[Laughter].#
0 A:  Yeah, no, I mean they were saying that of us, that we're the North
0 yeah. 
1 A:  Whatever, I, I don't want to make, I read it somewhere, though it's not my
0 pay back now and, uh, uh, so they're not exactly business men.  I do think we
0 up here an, to, to get the jobs, you know, there, there may be some organized
0 way to do this.
0 B:  Well I grew up in Los Angeles. 
0 A:  Okay, well you see it, saw it out there then, too. 
0 a lot of potential for business down there, for the products certainly that we
0 A:  Wha-, what are you taking in school,
0 A:  #I didn't# ask you that.  What are you taking in school?
1 A:  #yeah,# you're an instructor, yeah, you said. 
1 B:  Yeah, I had a similar thing, that I've worked on cars ever since I was, uh,
0 a kid [laughter].  And that was some time ago, but I've gotten to the point
0 B:  or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection
0 system breaks down,
0 A:  Yeah, I used to have, uh, ch-, Chevy van, it was a short van,
0 can just stand there and work on it.
1 junk off, before you can get too it.
1 A:  Well that's true. 
0 tractors, you know, what are about the size of your thumb, and the-,
1 B:  I've had a lot of good service out of that car, but, uh, uh, I finally gave
0 B:  #and# it was the van that I needed then, to buy the, you know, traded it
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 cylinder that I think was like about two thirty-five or so.  But, uh,
0 A:  Like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes. 
0 say, you can see the road. 
0 B:  It's amazing. 
1 there in the front.  And I said well where are the other three. 
0 shoved right up against the fire wall. 
0 them breaks,
0 B:  Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system,
0 know, it's like how much money did the U S spend when they could have paid so
0 B:  And you know, it's, it was basically all based on oil because nobody
0 because, see the thing is, is like every time that I see a war, I see myself on
0 A:  Yes, that's really unfortunate, it really is.  I don't know if we stopped
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  Well the thing is, is that first of all they got to, they go-, they have to
1 B:  # th-, I # think it was like, I don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty
0 di-, leave it at a dollar ten, people are still going to pay.
0 A:  Oh really. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Right, I think Mobil was doing very well, too. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, sure. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 owns Shell.  I'm not sure about that. 
0 B:  # before, you # know, it's like yeah sure, you know, like to, to a couple
0 of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not
0 B:  I think we're going to end up back there in a few years or, if, if not
0 A:  But I also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward. 
0 A:  An, uh, and I think that's good, you know,
0 A:  And perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we
0 had the experience of Vietnam. 
1 B:  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  #Yes.#
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  No, no, they don't and, you know, they're just real shallow people. 
1 B:  You know.

0 B:  And, uh, so, then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a

0 B:  Um, in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with, uh, I have one son who's
1 B:  A-, and, uh, my daughter is, um, [smack] has moved out of the house.  Her
1 and I get along a lot better now that she's moved [laughter] out of the house
1 [laughter].
0 B:  And uh, so it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,
0 and I think it's important that we do, because, uh, [smack] I notice that, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  there.
0 B:  Yeah.  What's your, been your experience?
1 B:  Huh.
1 A:  And, but ours are all out of the nest [laughter].
0 expensive.  And, uh, our youngest is, uh, expecting her first baby.  So,
1 they're, they're all out and on their own.  [noise] They're, and we have one
1 A:  And one lives in Connecticut {tape skips on Speaker A's section} and our
1 baby lives just a mile over the hill [laughter],
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  life's much more difficult than that.
1 B:  mean, the, the, the capability to, uh, create children doesn't necessarily
0 B:  And,
0 full time and I have mixed feelings about that.  She's able to do that and I
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Okay.  A lot of the people I've, that's call-, I've talked to work for, uh,
0 A:  now.
0 B:  Yeah.  It, uh, it was, uh, it was a, a smart move to make.
0 B:  I was more intelligent than the position I was holding.
0 B:  And, 
0 A:  And you, 
1 B:  Yeah [breathing].
1 stay together as much as you can,
0 A:  because it's very easy to, uh, become, go your own direction --
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, it, it all paid off.
0 A:  Yes. 
0 person.  And we asked him to take us to the opera house and he did not know

1 A:  Just a little bit. 
0 B:  But, this is America and our language is English.

0 A:  But, I do think if you come to America and you're going to live here and
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # Well, #
0 A:  Doesn't make any, # sense.  #
0 A:  We cannot,

0 A:  Right. 
0 it was the first thing, like I said the pilot,
0 century ((now)),

1 here in upstate New York, and it's not too much different so,
0 out it's television career as it were,
0 A:  Quite possible that they wanted it to become more of the subtle problems
0 A:  # to # the, the hitting over the head type problems that it was then. 
1 B:  It's a lot different seeing Carroll O'Conner in that role than, um, Archie
0 B:  #And maybe a little more versatile# than anybody ever gave him credit for.
0 A:  No, the, the ALL IN THE FAMILY reruns, #that are being shown now.# 
0 people that watch this,

0 A:  Grew up in West Texas, thank you.

0 A:  in fact, I may still be, um, we,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Yeah, the cats do it in there, you pull it and take it out and throw it
0 away, and that's it, [laughter].
0 B:  and what we used to do was just put, um, newspaper on the bottom and then
1 and dump the whole thing.
0 pan very, very rarely,
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I that true, yeah.  Yeah, she's even got, she's got one dog now and the two
1 all the animals but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely

0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  That's, um, pampering the, the petals [laughter].

1 they couldn't find it anyplace, they couldn't figure out what had happened and
0 B:  And you, they're, like you say, they're not the most exciting pet to have.
0 in college that they had a tank of piranha,
1 A:  and, uh, you know, used to drop mice in (( )) this is not, these aren't
0 A:  Yep.
1 B:  and ((your things)) destroyed the mice.  But,
0 B:  ((Yeah)), mine had been a, a, a how did this work, a mill rat had been
1 know, this rat is acting really strange I think he's sick, and she said, I
1 don't think he's sick, I think she's pregnant, [laughter].
0 B:  And they had ((misclassed)) the sex of (( )) ((back there)) and so, um, she
0 on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working,
0 getting one from birth and everything.
0 convenient little pet to have because it stayed in it's cage and, you know, it
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Oh people,

0 A:  Not this past fall but I mean fall,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Um, I had a friend who went to Colombia and I used to go up and visit her.
0 B:  Yeah, that's not too far from were we live, do you have, you said you had
0 two cats, are they, um, just what you call it, are they breed cats or anything
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 pushes the other one away from the food.  Apparently w-, I don't know all the

1 A:  And we only have one.  We tore all the rest of them up. 
0 B:  [laughter], okay.
0 A:  #chapter# thirteen and stuff like that. 
1 B:  But that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time,
0 establish some credit,
1 B:  Huh. 
0 don't ever have to pay them any, uh, interest.  Now it's, and people say, well,
0 B:  Huh. 
0 well, we're just going to send it to you, you know, you don't have to ever use it
1 of thing, you know, all you got to do is go cash those things and you've got a
1 are going to charge you interest, ((and stuff)), of course, she ter-, tore it up.
1 that, you know, they've got something, maybe they've won something.
0 B:  #[laughter].#

0 B:  [laughter].  
0 I have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen.  She got, uh, I can't
0 A:  and she is charging out of her mind already.  And I'm going, you just got off.
1 That's how you got on to it to start with, you know, what is the matter with this
0 the whole place,
1 charge a whole bunch and lose everything, did you?
0 I hate, I hate living paycheck to paycheck.  I like to have a little

0 B:  Where did you got, get there from?
1 wholes, you know.
0 B:  [Laughter] I would imagine so. 
0 it, then it stretches,
0 A:  Oh, it's a rent, it's a multistory, uh, last year, uh, luckily,

0 it's cheaper like you say, but, uh, the soil does move a lot here and they say
0 A:  # put a basement # in the soil but I'd think they just, to me I don't know
0 A:  No, no, it's not very high.  Some of the water here,

0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 they have storm cellars or anything.  They just,
0 B:  # and # then the main room bathroom ((area)) is halfway between both,

0 A:  So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or
1 A:  # but, # God this is much better than west Texas.

0 Austin that whole area is, is actually quite, quite nice.

0 meal and, and, uh, fortunately for us there's not a whole lot of places in the

0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 that you and I are, are keying off on,
1 A:  To my, my priority was just being as worldly as I could possibly be
0 walk into a company and see someone you went to school with,
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  That's great, that's great.  Yeah, that's what I, that's basically what I,
0 A:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #
1 needed to do.  So,
0 A:  {Very faint} Right.  Well, that was pretty courageous [laughter]. 
1 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  # Oh, yeah, yeah.  #
1 B:  Sounds familiar, huh? Your, it's very fresh in your memory. 
0 B:  If, if nothing else because I work in training at T I now,
0 all of your needs to make, to give you the, the potential to do whatever you
0 the most now is not smarts, not what I can do on paper, it's stamina, courage,
0 lot of programs about the environment and, you know, how we're affecting the
0 A:  I mean, it's incredible.  And, um, they said that they're, you know, they
0 B:  I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could, would, the, I mean, or even
0 that can damage the Earth.
0 B:  We've got Imperial sugar but, uh, and they're, you know, they're right
0 B:  And, uh,
0 B:  Right, yeah. 
0 all that,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  so, they have a lot of cattle in the area, I mean, they've got like per,
0 B:  Oh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  and all this stuff is seeping through to the water,
0 A:  and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have,
0 B:  These are ((well fed)). 
1 A:  they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area.  You,
0 B:  Good grief, these are well fed cows, uh, [laughter], 
1 A:  and I'm just like, oh, my gosh, and the smell is really bad they sa-,
0 rain, you know,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 really, uh, made it well-known how to do it, uh, that's my perception.  But,
0 [breathing] best person for recycling, but I'll be damned if, you know, if
0 have to, have to recycle.  You have to, you have to, you know, on Mondays they
0 pick up glass, and on Tuesdays it's [breathing], you know, plastics or
0 fine you for using water.  You know, they just --
0 A:  Um, I haven't seen that done for a long time either. 
0 B:  Yeah, no deposit, no return. 
0 A:  # Um.  #
1 kind of interesting, though. 
1 A:  [Laughter] There needs to be legislation that they should all be the same
1 be great.  I, I'd support that entirely, because [breathing], you know, as a
0 you have two trash cans in your office.  One, one is,
0 A:  # for # the regular, non recyclable trash,
0 B:  # Right.  You're T I, right? #
0 B:  I guess there's the other side of the issue that, uh, there need to be
0 recycled paper in the office. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Well, I think they actually do some of that but,
0 A:  # [Cough].  #
1 of building is already,
1 thousand and,
0 A:  But I thought I'd try one more time and sure enough, it's okay. 
1 B:  Oh, no.  
1 we've just been all over the neighborhood, we've been calling neighbors
1 A:  Um, he's part golden Lab and part, uh, [lipsmack], let's see, Alaskan, no,
0 like this before, and, [breathing] I would think, you know, he might, I mean,
1 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Oh, that's tough.  
1 you [laughter].
1 a wimp and,
1 A:  [Noise] you know.  I mean, they, you can love them all you want and they
1 B:  or what you act like,
0 A:  You know, it's, that's, I don't know [laughter], this is just so hard.
1 B:  Oh. 
1 were going to find him, you know, and when we didn't it was, like, oh, no,
1 were trying to find some pictures of him recently.  We've got so many when he
1 A:  you know, but we just don't have a whole lot.  We have him on film, you
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.  
0 A:  You know, but you can't put that on the [laughter], 
1 B:  No, you sure can't.  
0 B:  They can keep their eyes open, yeah.  
0 A:  I think that if somebody else picks him up, I think that, uh, if he gets
1 A:  [Breathing] I know.  It's just like, it's, it's just so ironic that this
0 and when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  He's, cats are really almost more territorial than, than dogs are.  They
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Well, they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not, they're
1 and, but if he's not in the mood, you'd better stay away from him.
1 there, and like, like you to pet them and loving.
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, oh.  
0 A:  -- or they'll rub their, their head against you, you know [laughter].
1 A:  yeah.  The backyard, it's really big, too, for him to run in and stuff.
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- you know, but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because, you
0 investigate.
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 know, they seemed to be upset, but now it's like, uh, well if he doesn't come
1 home, can we get another dog [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] yeah, that sounds like kids.  
1 [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] Oh. 
1 the Ranger baseball player that used to be here.
1 Ranger games, and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason.
0 B:  Well, kind of, because it's temporary. 
1 B:  Well no, but we spent twenty years in Oklahoma.  We're a mobile society
1 [laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh, so yours is, your home right now is typical of the ones that are in the
0 B:  Oh, gosh. 
0 A:  It's a, it's a New England type, uh, I was born and brought up in the area
0 there's a Colonial, [breathing]  our street's on just a short street.  There's
0 B:  Uh-huh, sure. 
0 B:  # My goodness.  #
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # It's, # uh, one of those type,

1 B:  My spinach [laughter]. 
0 B:  # Sure, yeah.  #
0 A:  All right. 
0 jeans,

1 A:  # When you're training, right.# 
0 B:  # garb [laughter].  #
1 A:  Yeah. 
1 and,
1 A:  And, uh, so then when I, you know, I finally get a chance to go out with my
1 husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 [laughter], # maybe next year [laughter].  #
0 A:  So,

1 A:  Yeah, yeah, and I, I just don't spend, you know, right now my clothes come
1 time,
1 A:  You know, I have very little furniture,

0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # with # all the,
0 B:  No.  I've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet,
1 B:  # and, # and running, you know, a line in there for my iron so I could do
1 it in there and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah [laughter], that's an idea. 
0 B:  So, I have a big closet. 
0 A:  Yeah, I, you know, if I have, if I know I'm having somebody come over to
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 that kind of stuff, you know. 
0 B:  That's right. 
1 A:  It's like, it's easy, you just do it, you know. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think I'd know what to do if it wasn't there, you
1 know. 
1 A:  My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes. 
0 A:  You know. 
0 B:  Okay, #take care.#

0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 these knock offs, so there's, probably the way to do it if you really wanted to

0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 I don't like a machine that's smarter than me.
1 stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten.

0 B:  Well, actually most of the music that I listen to there's no theme, it's
0 B:  Um, and I tend to like instrumental better, because there isn't that
0 like in, into jazz, uh, Jean Luc Ponty is, he's kinds of a, he's, he's jazz,
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  They're more, they're more like progressive.  
0 B:  Um, no.  Progressive music is more like they have real complex, um, uh,

0 B:  Um, it's, it's a more complex, it's, it's not your, your typical top forty
0 more complex.

0 B:  Like his first two albums were really good.  
1 it, because some of it is just really awful,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Right.  You don't know until you listen to it.  
0 B:  Um, and that's really all that I've really sampled that I, why, I should
0 B:  I just know that I like it.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well,
0 B:  Yeah.

0 of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a
0 A:  they really, really have, have a disadvantage that we 
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 B:  do that for, yeah,  
1 B:  Yeah, I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
0 that's sad.
0 wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.
1 A:  That's the last thing you want,  
0 A:  Yeah, that's exactly it.   
1 A:  Right.    
1 A:  Okay, I'm going to let you kind of lead the pack,
0 B:  # Oh.  #
1 A:  # and # I've had two cornea transplants.  Shopping is no fun anymore
1 B:  You can't read labels and you can't,
0 B:  And at this point we only have one board so it wasn't so bad so we used it

0 time and things like that, and then we come, we get the computer home, my
1 husband goes to pick it up last week and we couldn't go get it sooner because I
0 just had the baby, and [laughter], 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Do you buy it at some major store?
1 like this. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  And it kind of has to start from the top and, and go clea-, or from the
0 people just don't care about,
0 A:  what I'm doing, right.  I think that's too bad.  And it's a shame too
1 because, uh, when you get right down to it most things, there isn't any, if you
0 the first one fired,
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  # about # their work.  And so,
0 work for itself without any pay, you know. 
0 A:  Yeah.  The,
1 B:  -- Tex-Mex, not real Mexican food,

1 A:  -- and I've been talking about it ever [laughter] ever since,
0 restaurant, they just all kept an eye on all the tables --
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 butter and then the next second [talking]  anoth-, a different waiter brought
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  -- and it's just a little small restaurant, [throat_clearing]  pardon me,
0 A:  # [Throat_clearing].  #
0 B:  -- and, uh, you know, it's just, it's real nice, # and, #
0 A:  -- and, and at the end of our meal, you know, we're ready to go and we're
1 A:  # that # the restaurant has, so it was like ten desserts on one plate and

0 A:  No.  I think, I think it's, it's got, I like the texture of it is why I
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  -- B a s q u e --
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Oh, at least once a week.  We're, we're retired now.  When we working out
0 B:  Yeah, I understand. 
1 adventurer.  I'll,
0 A:  Oh have you? 
1 A:  Right, uh-huh.  I don't care to go to a place just for the price of it
1 A:  -- with high prices and seven courses isn't what I usually look for
1 A:  So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something
0 A:  Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex. 
1 B:  Yeah, home cooked Tex-Mex. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 you talk about Mexican cuisine you, that's kind of like talking about American
0 we don't get here, and we're in the mountains in Virginia.
1 almost a week. 
1 B:  And it was, {pause} I was like a man starving at every meal. 
0 A:  Right, yeah.  A lot of the restaurants you can get two pou-, two one pound
0 B:  Uh, it sounds wonderful.  Uh, so,
0 B:  Hm. 
1 B:  Huh. 
1 B:  Uh-huh.  It, there's all kinds,
1 A:  Probably needed some cold beer with it and [laughter], 
0 B:  You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches. 
1 A:  Uh-huh.  It's fun, but it's just so much food [laughter].  Hate to come
0 eight thousand foot elevation. 
0 weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES WITH WOLVES, which
0 turned out to be an extremely good movie.
0 B:  I haven't seen that yet.  I, I, I hear, we, a whole bunch of us were going
0 A:  It's, uh, the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in
0 needs a big screen.  It's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees
0 and the buffalo and the whole thing, it's just, uh, just amazing, amazing
1 A:  Yeah.  What have you been to lately?
0 B:  Yeah, I wasn't, I mean, I've seen his other movies, and I just think he's
0 B:  Right. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Right.  Both of them are dead, and they happen to meet in this, this town,
0 A:  Yeah, it is. 
0 B:  Probably, probably worth seeing on video.  Actually we really enjoyed it,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah.  I like it when they will do something and not get too silly.  I've
0 like, so then they get crazy and, and it doesn't end like the story has been
0 not, doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican.  I, I do get
0 somewhat of a kick out of, because Schwartzkopf, or the other generals, who I
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  -- that's kind of an interesting recent thing, that I could think of
0 B:  They want him because he's popular, not because he can do the job. 
0 in the service, and Schwartzkopf, uh, you know, might make a good, uh,
1 A:  Uh, you, you pick one. 
0 think the reason why we've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund
0 should happen for Congress.  I, I'd lik-, you know, that would be my answer of
0 of the office staff and all that stuff.
0 A:  Uh-huh [child_crying]. 
0 of dollars to buy consultants, and then they don't even do that
0 B:  Actually, I haven't made any calls, but I received about a dozen. 
0 B:  I think, yeah, I have to make these, but I get distracted and get to do
0 but I am amazed by, people say they got thirty.  Well, I wonder why you need
1 thirty renditions of the persons voice, but I'm not in voice synthesis.
0 sorry [laughter].
1 A:  Um, not really, not really.  I've, uh,
1 A:  Yeah, we, uh, we grew up with the same music,
1 B:  Yeah, indeed.
1 A:  And they, they sang here, [singing] RAP ISN'T MUSIC [laughter],
0 A:  It was pretty funny.
1 the same thing with this rap stuff.  I mean, a-, at least with rock and roll
1 it took talent [laughter].
0 and sometimes not even a good one, you know, you,
1 A:  Yeah, that, that must be it.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Run, D and C.  Yes.  Run, I mean, uh, uh.
1 B:  No exactly.  You know, is it going to be picked up by a symphony, you
0 A:   Yeah, I know, and you, you'll, you'll never hear it in the,
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 music.
0 A:  Um, I've heard of it.
0 B:  Yeah, if, if you, if you have access to a computer and one of the
0 information services, I would suggest that that's the way you go.
1 B:  Listen, it's been a pleasure.  I'm getting ready for STAR TREK, THE NEXT
0 B:  It's coming on in two minutes.  So.
0 collecting wine, but from your, from the description it sounds like they're
1 more interested in painting.
0 the white zinfandels now.  I've come up the ladder the chablis and the rhines,
1 B:  Oh, okay.  White zinfandels are not a big favorite of mine. 
0 B:  I'm originally from El Paso, Texas. 
0 Yunon, New Mexico, which is just north of El Paso up the valley.
0 under.  Have you ever visited the wineries in California. 
0 there.  Back to hobbies, I guess.  And, what kind of painting do you do?
0 A:  Oh, did you?
1 B:  And I'd go twice a week for three hours and you do that for about ten
1 years, you get to where you can actually [laughter] draw pretty well.
1 painting stuff and the wine cellars. 
1 A:  Yeah, I guess so, guess so.  Well [throat_clearing] the only hobbies I have
0 is I jog, and, uh, every night, and that's just, that [laughter] and my yard
0 my flowers, you know, and stuff.  I like to do stuff like that, and I have
0 there's big signs telling them not to go in without checking with the
0 volunteer, and you must be twelve years of age to go in and no more than two
1 that's three of them just.  You know, there's three rules right there he
0 busted [laughter] and he walked right on in.  And I thought, golly, you know,
1 he didn't even follow any of the rules, and I, didn't even seem to bother.
1 B:  [Laughter]  And he probably didn't like that. 
0 you all do, calibrate and,
1 I'm not a native Texan, but I love Texas.  So, I wasn't happy till I got back
1 [laughter].
0 So,
1 don't know, I just couldn't stand being away from Texas.  I kept coming back,
1 up.
1 uh, I guess I'll never know. 
1 B:  -- there's something about that, I don't know if it's the simplicity of it,
1 or just the total stupidity of it [laughter], 
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  And, uh, I don't get to watch T V that often, or sit back and enjoy it.  I
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 episode.
0 it's like you turn on and about eighty-seven things happen in an episode now. 
1 A:  What life would have been like if you had not been born. 
1 B:  Should be interesting. 
0 B:  Right.  He's, uh, with him producing that, it, it, he hasn't done a bad
1 B:  It didn't do anything for me. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah.  The one that fell down the,
0 A:  An elevator shaft.  That was, that was pretty funny [laughter].  It's like
0 we, we were all. 
1 A:  Yeah, it was like we were all sitting here going, What just happened?
0 missed it, and it's like next thing you know they're all just looking down the
0 shaft going, you know, What happened.
0 B:  Yes. 
0 A:  Yeah, because it guess it's on at seven o'clock on, on Thursdays. 
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better --
0 A:  I agree [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 All I have to do,
0 A:  And they run for two months at a time.  And you have to, you do have to pay
1 B:  And, I, I was, I would go faithfully, and then I missed once.
1 A:  And I've, lately, uh, there's been nights that I could have gone and I've
1 have gone Monday.
1 A:  So, I'm kind of finding excuses, and now it's kind of like, well, this is
0 do the same the same thing.
0 B:  Like it's misery loves company.  I don't really love exercise.  I mean,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 in my apartment complex in this neighborhood, and we try to, we used to try to
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess.
0 B:  Exactly --
0 A:  -- I'd feel better.
1 A:  Well, I'm too tired, or I have a headache or,
1 A:  well, I just got over the flu, and I'm still kind of draggy so I better not
0 so important to good health.
0 A:  It's just hard to make yourself go.  And I, I think one thing I don't like
0 been sweaty, and, and it, you know, I don't really feel like going in the
1 A:  Of course, I feel like once I've done it, if I'm sweaty I might as well do
1 A:  Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money, you'd
1 the T I.  They've got two different aerobics rooms, they have the mirrors.  Of
1 course, sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall [laughter] --
0 B:  Yeah, and then they hire private instructors?
0 A:  And they have ceiling fans in the rooms, and it's, it's a pretty nice
0 setup.  Um, and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at
1 they possibly can for you.
0 even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things
0 B:   Oh, you have a pool there, too?
0 the, you know, everything you'd need just about.
0 facilities, and it's about eight dollars a month.
1 B:  Oh, that's not bad.
0 A:  Pretty cheap.
0 A:  And then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership,
0 I've heard.
1 A:  No, I'm going to Onum. 
0 B:  Were you happy with your return this year?
1 A:  Huh?
1 B:  Were you happy with your tax return this year?
0 A:  Well, what do you, uh, what do you think, uh, uh, what's your biggest gripe
0 relatively small compared to like the, uh, the tax you pay on sales, sale
0 A:  -- when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler, and all that kind
1 A:  And I seem to have more of that every year. 
0 uh, I thought, at one time I worked in Malaysia for T I and had more money
0 got almost paid off, and all kinds of equity in it, and don't have, huh, and,
0 you know, struggling to keep, I've got two children in college and I'm going
1 A:  Oh, you know, you just got married. 
0 A:  And you'll find out that in Texas we've got, uh, I think we rank fiftieth
1 A:  And, and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise the taxes and
0 B:  I think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these
1 actually out there teaching.  And it's sort like we do at T I. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  Sounds like T I, I was getting ready to say. 
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 Plus, it doesn't cut it as early.  You know, you buy a ten cent candy in seven
1 B:  Oh really. 
1 B:  Oh, man. 
0 @@B:  Yeah, Purdue. 
0 B:  Yeah, they, well, it's just been the last three or four years --
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 @B:  [Breathing]  How should they do it? Why didn't it work last time?
0 and English. 
0 you know.  You buy a quart of milk, and sure it has, has the metric equivalent
0 B:  That, that's the problem. 
0 know, when I was growing up, we were talking metric system in school. 
0 B:  I mean, not, not at first, but by the time I was in fifth or sixth grade
0 B:  I would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age, you know,
1 know, anybody caught talking in the English, you know,
0 with the T I drawing, well, with any drawing system --
0 A:  And then some of them are done in, you know, purely metric. 
0 B:  Yeah, I remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back
1 B:  Is about twice as much, what it works out to. 
0 was, was even different than, you know, S A E standards and stuff.  So, 
0 ended up with about three sets of tools --
1 Part of it's built in Canada.  Matter of fact, the thing is, I always say it's
0 them up. 
0 the whole nine yards.  Kind of hard to do gradually.
0 the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start
1 and I were real into psychological things.  We, we think people with mind
1 because, uh, well, are you going to see it? I don't want to tell you how it
1 A:  I, I, I, uh, I plan on probably renting it at some point in my life. 
0 B:  And, I read the story in PEOPLE MAGAZINE about where they got the
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 We'll call each other now and then and go, Remember when in the movie this
1 afterwards so we could sit and talk about it. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Maybe just go out for a soda or something [laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 bit of this, little bit of that, and that's about it.
0 great grandparents that were full blood. 
0 A:  And, but they were on opposite sides. 
0 B:  That was awful. 
0 A:  And, I mean, it's just like we're raping our land now, but. 
1 A:  They had something we wanted. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah, yeah. 
0 tell us and we could just like wipe out an entire people like that.  That's
1 a joke.
1 A:  Yeah, but he who has the biggest stick is still going to win. 
1 B:  Yeah, that's true.  He with the most toys [laughter].  I guess. 
1 Place. 
0 when, you know, the actors are doing things that you know are about to reap
0 some bad thing, and everyone in the theatre will go, uh [breathing] {sharp
1 B:  -- and all the guys were just kind of staring straight ahead like that
0 was joking with me about how I wasn't going to watch half of it, I was going
0 to close my eyes.  And there were quite a few scenes where I did.  But this
1 breath}, and my boyfriend jumped.
1 B:  He literally jumped.  And he swears he didn't do it.  And I felt him jump. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  Oh, that's great. 
1 says, no, no.  You just didn't watch it, you should have watched it, it wasn't
1 that bad.  I'm like, yeah, right, that's why you jumped [laughter]. 
0 video now. 
0 you could be walking right next to one of them, and not even know it, because
1 A:  Yeah, okay, that's, uh, 
1 which, um, I think kind of defeats,
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  I mean, somebody's missing the point [laughter].
1 B:  Right [laughter].  Well, I've got four hundred and fifty records, and it's
0 I know it is like eight hundred to nine hundred --
0 can't afford it.
0 A:  And, um, the other is, some of the stuff that, um, I've got a, and I'll
1 B:  Uh, yeah, used to be.  I mean, I, I still like him a lot, but he's, he's
1 gotten so kind of weird [laughter].  In that he was truly weird before, and
0 A:  Um, I haven't been, I been, uh, I got to pay attent-,
1 A:  Um?
1 A:  It seems so odd to me that David Bowie is showing up in PEOPLE magazine.
1 A:  I mean,
1 uh, of him and Bing Crosby doing PEACE ON EARTH, uh, LITTLE DRUMMER BOY.
1 B:  #One up,# yeah.
1 A:  people out on music that one usually gets them [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] Um, I got, I've got like bootlegs of his concerts and stuff,
1 B:  And now it all seems for naught, you know?  You can get his old stuff on C
1 B:  It's like, what were all those hours, those little treasures I have, but I
1 A:  Um,
0 A:  Um, but he's found some of the Who stuff for me.  You know, we went, you
0 rarity albums that had like half the stuff on it, it's like, great.
0 was something called "Waltz for a Pig" which wasn't on any record and it
1 found objectionable, I think the one, uh, I look all white, but my dad was
0 can't release this, so they, it has a different lyric on it, so that's kind of
0 hear things that are different than the way the Who actually recorded the
1 collections that are the sa-, almost the same as songs the Who did on their
0 IT'S HARD with, um, a different verse, so [clicking],
1 A:  [Snorting].
1 didn't even know who Mot the Hoople was,
1 A:  #Oh, but you got a good one, though [laughter].#
0 A:  Yeah, I'm like that a lot with the Who, I've got, I, I counted it up
1 I know that's kind of a strange thing to say, but, uh, do you see like, tho-,
0 You're going to go listen to it and go this girl's really weird.  But I mean
1 it's like,
1 want to throw up usually when I hear it anymore.
1 blind, I don't, I can't even, uh, think of what now, and I kept saying, no,
1 other combination there is.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 and then, uh, they have one day for, like, um, oh, everything you picked up
0 B:  # and # we put that in disposable bags, and they pick that up on Monday. 
0 next couple of months.
0 shelters.  And, they have, one, two, they have three, I think, that I know of
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  So they're really going at it, and I think it's marvelous because,
0 A:  Yeah.  I, I guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is. 
0 B:  But I've already gone to, oh I started years ago, I guess, not years ago,
0 of the things I wonder about, uh, one of the questions was, do you think more
0 should be done, or something else.  I, I wonder about some of the prod-,
0 A:  Um. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 higher. 
0 a good reason to do it, but the cost is kind of prohibitive.
0 something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than
0 B:  and the recycle ones are better to use, but lots of times you don't even
1 bigger for people to see it.  I had to put my bifocals on to see it
1 B:  Oh. 
0 this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 take my garbage back out.  I wish they'd really push this recycling bit,
0 tell me some of the things that's happened in your area?
1 A:  Yeah (( )).
0 huh, you know that, that was immediately what clicked in my head.  What do I
1 B:  So, not quite fourteen.  The, uh, I think we are seeing lots and lots of,
1 B:  -- and the ones that are having them earlier they're having them a lot
1 earlier [laughter] like eleven [laughter] or ten [laughter]. 
0 B:  And, uh, that was, you know, really a definitely, uh, identifying factor,
0 A:  Yeah, I don't, I'm not sure about that [throat_clearing]  excuse me. 
0 for nineteen eighty-eight [sigh]  --
0 put, you know, very few moved away. 
0 B:  So there's kind of a nucleus of cohesion there. 
1 talked about children's rights, you know we didn't talk about women's rights
1 A:  Yeah, right.  I think,
0 B:  You know, we sure didn't talk about kids' rights [laughter]. 
1 know, kind of thumb your nose and --
1 seventies and eighties were so, uh, get all you can cause you may not be here
1 A:  Yes it is. 
0 have massive influx of crickets from the fields into our homes, you know, just
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 every once in awhile exercise that. 
0 B:  Do they have a law on the books up there?
0 come to that with, uh, as you say, brutal crimes, because of the prison system
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 might say, yeah, you know. 
0 A:  # Go with it, huh [laughter]?  #
1 B:  # Give me an injection.  But, # uh,
1 A:  Well, we certainly hope not. 
0 A:  Do you think, uh, you know, uh, lately they've had, oh in the last few
0 think that they should be faced with the death penalty?
0 but I have a friend who's is a school teacher, and she has a nine year old
1 A:  So you think our, our, uh, values have to come down to dollars and cents
0 A:  Yes. 
0 B:  it j-, just doesn't seem, uh,
0 whether he is rehabilitated to the point that he can go back out in society
0 B:  Right. 
0 isn't it [laughter]?
1 drop them all off. 
0 on parole.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  -- never made it to the jury. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Uh, do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?
0 had all sorts of character witnesses and what not,
0 A:  Oh, for heaven's sake.  So there's nine years of that man's life gone. 
0 one in the world.
1 to, uh, burning a flag, I'd, I'd try to kill them, I would. 
0 that far. 
0 B:  -- I was in Korea --
0 B:  See how they'd like it under another flag. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 hearing that, uh, well, the jury came in with a guilty verdict and they
0 A:  Well, it's been nice talking to you, Jack, and I hope you have a real good
1 discussing. 
1 B:  So am I.  In building, which building?
1 A:  [Laughter].

0 B:  Okay. 
1 A:  # uh, # you know, it was, uh, it was, you know,

0 A:  # uh, #
1 A:  {Stutters} Well, that's the one,

0 A:  # it's basically about, uh, college, # uh,
0 B:  # Oh, okay.  #
0 A:  But, uh, but it's, it's a pretty good show.  It, uh,
0 came out with an album. 
0 there's that one called BEVERLY HILLS ONE OH TWO ONE OH, or something like
1 A:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Um.  I'm not sure.  I don't know what's happened.  Uh, I know a lot of,
1 I, I needed a break.  And I watched JOHNNY CARSON last night.  A little more
0 level, you know, [laughter]  and so --
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  # LETTERMAN # starts pretty late out here, about twelve o'clock. 
1 people now, there are so many, uh, [sigh]  everybody has V C R's and rents so
1 convertible or, uh, or a four by four or something, I guess the next car I'll
1 be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door [laughter].
0 B:  Okay.
1 B:  Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership
0 A:  That'll do it.
1 but it died on me.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 putting it through its paces.
0 B:  but it's still a little cramped.  I've got three kids,
0 A:  and a lot of those.  And it comes with a bigger engine and the things like
1 A:  and usually they're in like black,
1 B:  Yeah.  Well, my wife wants a Miata.  
1 A:  Oh, well sure [Laughter]. 
0 A:  That's what, you know, until, until you look at the price tag and then --
1 A:  -- and having a lot of fun, what would I really do with this car?
1 A:  But that, that just does not make it as an only car.
1 a time,
0 B:  Oh, no!
1 A:  -- with the top down, and the speaker in the passenger seat.
0 B:  And, uh, because I got a good deal on it --
0 A:  Yeah.
0 I had never, I, I'd learned on an automatic transmission.
1 A:  Boy, that's a good deal.
1 B:  #And it worked.#
1 where we just went to a big parking lot --
1 that was all it was.  It was, it was the funniest thing, it was like, uh,
0 B:  And in, this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had
1 A:  Oh, well.  Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say,
0 A:  because it's so big. 
1 B:  And you've got to pay for it too.
0 B:  And I bet, and I bet it costs twice as much as, as when --
1 A:  It,
1 A:  Oh, okay. 
0 more because I, I enjoy it so much.  But with correcting papers and, and I, two
1 interesting.  And I, uh, of course, I don't ever get around to reading them
0 B:  Yeah, yeah. 
1 B:  Oh, my word. 
0 A:  And it was like, uh, I want to read something else for a while [laughter]. 
1 A:  Oh, okay, yeah.  He, um, I must have like fifty or sixty books by him
1 A:  Um, so it's really, you know, it's, it's fun to, to do that.  Uh,
1 A:  Wh-, which, you know, when I read it, I should have realized that because,
0 him.  But wouldn't you think he would, does he get some royalties from that,
1 #hopefully?#
1 A:  #Oh, I'm sure he#  does [laughter]. 
1 B:  Well, I would think he would [laughter]. 
0 B:  Oh, I'm sure he is, I'm sure he is.  But sometimes the more you get the
1 of thing [laughter]. 
0 A:  # I'm # not, as inter-, you know, the other stuff is interesting but, um, I
0 B:  Is that right?
0 B:  But I, I was, uh, I'm not from here.  I'm originally from Ohio, so I've
0 always followed the Tigers.  Because, you know, I was,
0 A:  #Toledo.#
1 A:  #I was#  in Toledo last summer.  Went to a, uh, to a Mud Hens double header
1 [laughter]. 
1 time.  I used to live in Iowa too, and they have the Iowa Oaks.  And we used to
0 A:  Um. 
1 B:  #farm teams.# 
1 B:  it is.  It's not quite so serious, you know. 
0 there almost as much as the Orioles and, um,
1 B:  Oh, gosh.  See, it's higher than the Rangers. 
1 B:  You still can see well.  And, uh, we usually sit there unless somebody
1 B:  Oh, oh. 
0 A:  supposed to get a stadium in downtown Dallas?
0 A:  Oh, it d-, it didn't,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # and # it, you know, that's, all the tourists come there. 
0 of Fort Worth-Dallas, and, you know,
0 because I live just south of the Interstate. 
1 A:  H-, hop on the Interstate, and the stadium's right off the Interstate
0 reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because he's a real big Dick Vitelle
1 A:  Right, to get the full benefit out of them? [noise]. 
1 it a little bit and put it back for a while, and, you know, first thing you
1 A:  #Exactly#  [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] That got to be kind of silly, so I,
0 headlines --
0 B:  But then I, I like the paper because you do get more detail. 
0 then gets reported on later.
0 A:  #Okay.#
0 people,
0 A:  #Right.#
1 B:  And, and sometimes it's, uh, you know, sometimes it's just like I saw it,
0 A:  Accurate,
0 A:  -- and it was really interesting.  Then after a while, I mean, it just
1 seemed like, uh, everybody was an expert,
1 B:  -- #what's,#
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  quoting those guys and,
0 B:  [Child] So that just, uh, you know, that's a, a little lesson on how the
0 B:  Oh, yeah, #yeah.# 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah [child]. 
0 uh, you had T V reports coming out of Baghdad. 
0 we've got our own people right in the heart --
0 A:  I mean, they're just almost asking for it when they,
0 B:  # Oh, yeah.  #
0 me, I'm a reporter but --
1 A:  Right. 
1 B:  -- sometimes the crowd, [laughter] you know, or the people just don't
0 A:  # wh-, wh-, # what they going to, you know, what are we going to do? Go to
0 A:  Right. 
1 A:  Right. 
0 B:  Which, of course, we have to do, you know. 
0 A:  And, and, uh, the, man, the, just like you were saying, the me-, media of
0 B:  The personal tragedies and that kind of thing.  #But,#
0 B:  #yeah,# that's news but,
0 A:  # supposedly # --
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  # Right, #
1 A:  that's just, uh, and the media has jumped all over that. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  # [Children] when we moved # here.  And, um, it's getting to be too much
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 just started back about a year and a half ago.  And, um, my youngest one got
0 A:  And, um, so then I went to part-time work, and I'm going to school
0 B:  I know, I, you know, I can imagine.  Gee,
0 A:  #toys.# 
0 B:  And apartments, you can't accumulate --
1 A:  to put it. 
1 B:  And now, you know, well you've got the garage, [laughter]  you know. 
1 A:  yeah, you have more c-, control over it [laughter]. 
0 wa-, you know,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well I kept, kept things that, see my children are grown. 
1 the other mothers here, on my street that don't work, I mean my house is just,
1 A:  it looks horrible compared to theirs. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 it wouldn't take, you know, hundreds of dollars to decorate one room.  It, of,
0 uh, you see we did this one huge wall that we have.  And it was like three
0 kind, you know, that it wouldn't even cost that much.  But it was, it's a real
0 long wall.
1 in that area.  She said, You're not going to like it as much as this one
1 [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  #So that's#  --
0 find that.  And most places, places have four, and there are people that
0 A:  You know, we'll, we'll be able, it's mostly the closing costs that are
1 B:  So maybe you can get enough to cover that. 
0 B:  # you, # you, you're basically going to have to sell that one before you
0 B:  # at least to know.  #
1 [laughter], 
0 B:  Well, I think, uh, you know, I think, uh, real es-, houses, uh, are, th-,
0 B:  And, uh, so I mean it was, h-, had been pretty bad --
1 A:  Yeah, yeah.  I try to get one a day, and s-, I'm leaving the country here
0 A:  Uh, okay, Bill, you about ready to get started?
0 B:  But, uh, you know, it's, uh, sometimes quite a struggle to, uh, to do work
1 job is, is trouble shooting into the offshore site plants, which is okay.  But
0 supplies us, uh, where the, uh, where the job will be a hundred percent going
1 B:  I've been there thirty-two years. 
0 B:  Right. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 here in the next three days, uh, I have eighty-five days vacation.  And, and it
0 in essence going to be giving those back to the company, or most of them back. 
0 B:  That's right. 
0 B:  You mean, uh, mean holidays?
0 A:  And, uh, I, I guess what happens is, we don't have Christmas week, we have
0 B:  -- and we find that in that last, uh, couple of week of the year, all the
1 one was the, uh, Friday after Thanksgiving.  And I think the reason we got it
0 for a holiday was nobody worked it anyway [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Huh, that's strange. 
0 the plan.  We had been with Blue Cross and Blue Shield. 
0 administers paying the bills. 
0 A:  Yeah.  And, and, and the, uh, uh, they started out with having Managed
0 Mental Health Care. 
1 And, uh, write to them all and tell them that they've got an opportunity
1 @A:  We're official now, yeah,
0 A:  Oh, okay,
0 talk shows. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Right, right. 
0 A:  -- and so.  Uh --
1 why I'm not a farmer when I garden though,
0 A:  I mean, it is dog work, and it is tough --
0 A:  -- I have a lot of trees, down here, uh, the part I don't like, I guess,
0 A:  -- uh, but I do listen to that talk show.  There, there is some great
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 Augustine here. 
1 B:  No idea whatsoever. 
0 A:  Um. 
0 A:  Do you have much luck in the Winter, or they're, they're freeze it, freeze
0 B:  -- in the ice, everything, because here, you know, not as severe as the

1 nothing but,
0 like the Johnny Appleseed type trees, where people have come from, I'm sure
1 A:  (( )) from Pennsylvania and New Jersey, I'm from New Jersey originally. 
1 B:  Uh-huh, oh, you don't sound like it [laughter]. 
1 shouldn't do, uh,
0 appropriate, I guess, that I haven't been able to actually participate.  I've
0 B:  Oh, my, uh-huh. 
0 uh, when you, when did you get a house, uh, your, your trees grow up so well up
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  -- yeah. 
1 A:  -- in the South.  What else?
0 good, uh, has done a lot of experiments in the speech, uh --
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  -- you know, so, you, you, it's going to be much faster, of course, you
0 B:  Uh-huh, but then what about people that, um, I, I, I personally work with
0 A:  Anyway, what are your, what are your first comments on that {A pauses and
0 @B:  Uh, [breathing] my first comments on the budget.  I would say there #has,#
0 A:  But, uh, yeah, because I think it's all funded, either state or federally
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 I would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other
0 differences, uh, is that, you know, some countries pay for students to go to,
1 board.  Uh, they're not willing to, you know, to put that, you know,
0 clears this up.  {Tinkling phone noise} Is that better?
0 B:  Yes. 
1 A:  Okay. 
1 B:  Yeah.  It sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere
0 far as quote, quote college is concerned.  They've had it. 
0 B:  Well, it seems to me that kids that a-, get out of high school that parents
0 tell you which one I watched.  But they had on there, where the, the output
0 there, but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent,
1 uh, very wise in money matters and have ta-, have taken over a lot of
1 parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up.  And money is
0 appreciate the fact that, you know, that they have rights too.  But [sigh] on
0 where they're going to take over [/Child].
1 do is, is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest.  And, and
1 B:  I think probably that's,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 American dollars plus a lot of power in American com-, com-, companies.  And
0 many people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a, I
0 wrong word, but certainly were deserving to come.
0 challenge, they're starting to resent them. 
0 B:  But, uh, there is some, there has been some resentment with Orientals in
0 the Black community because they've started businesses there, and the Blacks
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 not being prejudiced and being, you know, uh, welcome, welcoming everyone --
0 very into that, the human rights part of everything. 
1 B:  An-, and yet, you know, with, uh, with, uh, {pause} there's somebody on my
0 A:  #Oh.# 
0 A:  Right. 
1 A:  I would, I would suspect that they have.  Well, I guess, um, I don't have
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  #Goal directed.# 
0 B:  Yeah.  But in stores and things, sometimes they can be very impolite
0 B:  But it's, it sometimes it's gets touchy. 
0 A:  #And I h-,#
0 A:  Yes. 
1 A:  I have, uh, two daughters who, who both are in college or, in fact, one has
0 American Express card and, and pay it off every month.

1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us.
1 A:  Oh, wow!  [Laughter].
1 offer you a, a credit card.
0 B:  Just I fe-, I feel like even that little bit helps.
0 A:  Johnson City, uh-huh.  I --
0 B:  So, I mean, it's, it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 collectors, I guess.
1 B:  Oh.
0 B:  #Ooh,#
1 B:  that's scary.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Might be worth it for peace of mind.
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  It is, it is.  You might even find somebody's been reporting on
0 thir-, thirty days is not real bad though anyway.  [Buzz]. {In phone line that
0 persists through the end of the recording.  Sounds like a cordless phone is

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 nineteen percent everyone else charges.
0 A:  [Throat_clearing] Well, always watch out for s-, anybody who bills you out

1 seemed like I was never paying the balance off,
0 like twenty-three percent interest.
1 B:  Holy cow!
0 A:  So anyway, they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent, I think,
0 in, in Texas.  But --
1 A:  -- there, there are a couple of states that can.  And one to watch out for
1 B:  I'll try to remember that one.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Wow!

0 A:  # to # get, you know, to get warm. 
0 the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, that's interesting.  I love the Texas
0 A:  Uh, there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area,
1 the heck of it.
1 A:  I don't know why, exactly. 
1 A:  And, uh, they are adding fifty minutes to it or something like that. 
1 A:  Yeah, that's what we,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 see when they came out beforehand, that, uh, I know are coming out on video,
1 and all that and then he suddenly become like a real screen idol,
0 but they, they like his character, I wouldn't say like, like his character, but
1 B:  This guy that works with me, told me not to go see it by myself at night,
0 A:  -- relishing every drop or something like that. 
0 B:  I think you either hate him or,
1 first place, trying to pass him off at age forty just was almost more,
0 A:  Plus, there is something about seeing those two walking through a mall,
0 B:  I believe I would too, but, and then the money they spent on that food,
0 spending.  Nobody spends that kind of money I don't think. 
0 A:  -- or I could go to Collin Creek or something like that --
1 B:  And I'm glad I didn't ask her to waste her time now because. 
0 A:  Yeah,
0 but I didn't see that.
0 B:  I want to see that movie {pause} uh, A KISS BEFORE.  Or before,
1 B:  Yeah, yeah I am.  I really don't like to see thrillers by myself, but, uh,
1 B:  Don't waste your, even at a dollar movie that one would have been bad.  Oh,
1 movie in a long time. 
0 B:  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMEN, yeah. 
1 A:  Uh, okay. 
1 B:  Yeah, he's, uh, he's okay in my book [laughter]. 
0 B:  And of course, Julia Roberts is cute too, but I, I didn't really know, I
0 A:  I haven't seen that, no.  No, we didn't go see that. 
0 B:  Nah. 
0 A:  That's,
0 B:  Yeah, and I didn't like that movie.  You know why I didn't like that movie,
1 A:  Because, because I mean, what he did was so corny. 
0 B:  Oh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 --
0 movies than I have. 
0 B:  Oh, okay.  Okay. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 time, you know.  There are evenings especially Friday nights, Thursday and
0 want to jerk the phone out of the wall, you know, your sitting down to eat and
1 A:  # Right.  #
0 A:  # and # expect you to talk to a computer, uh, that's where I draw the lin-,
0 B:  They can leave their whole spiel on it. 
0 A:  Yeah, they, they can erase all your others, you know, because if you have,
1 A:  But your right.  That was a good one. 
1 so I could talk about him,
0 B:  # [Laughter].  #
0 annoying, you know.  Uh, that's,
0 giving out information about your financial status. 
1 A:  Oh, yeah, that's, that's a good one too.  Yeah,
0 B:  # because # it was such a big deal.  And I wouldn't have been too thrilled

0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # Right.  #
1 haven't thought about any of this. 
1 B:  I'm in California. 
1 A:  Yeah, that's coast to coast [laughter]. 
0 B:  Right.  It's just, uh, about twelve thirty here. 
1 B:  That's right and I think that anything we can do to improve the federal

1 A:  Oh, California has always been a leader. 
1 B:  Well [laughter],  I, I hope,

0 be made much more efficient where a lot of the accounting is just, you know,
0 B:  # And, #
0 ago, to work for a state government for a while, and it absolutely boggled my
0 mind the way they budgeted because there was no, uh, an attempt to figure out
0 A:  And the mentality was and probably rightfully so because the people
1 A:  I'm surprised the feasibility study could be done for that [laughter]. 
1 talking about real money. 
0 A:  Now, you know, that's, that's a long time and that's a lot of money. 
0 A:  Have you,
1 with (( )).
1 B:  I doubt it. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 think are good, and having to lose,
0 B:  # Well, the thing that, #
1 that [laughter]. 
0 coherently even if I don't always agree with what they're expressing. 
1 A:  Oh, I, I can imagine. 
0 A:  Okay. 
1 A:  # I didn't see one on mine.  #
0 A:  Um. 
0 B:  Uh, gee, if I was at work, I could give you, I tell you what.  Call this
0 A:  Okay. 
0 A:  # Right.  #
0 B:  # And # if you put your clippings in that,
1 local recycling center was. 
0 B:  And she called it, and turns out the, the nearest one is in Garland. 
0 A:  Wow. 
0 B:  Yeah we, uh, in fact, I've got a car full of newspapers. 
0 B:  That we're trying to, uh, here's a sort of, I guess, a setback, uh, there
0 B:  I went to all of them yesterday, and none of them had bins,
1 B:  And you just eat when you have something to eat. 
1 A:  You just go in and you don't know when you are coming out [laughter]. 
1 A:  Let's see what else they are doing, uh, jeez, I'm all out of recycling
1 [laughter]. 
0 B:  # And, # uh, in fact, the, the kids at the end of the block come by every
1 A:  # And # it spits out money. 
1 okay.
0 A:  We got like eight cents or something.  Yeah exactly.  At work, we do
0 B:  And one is just for paper.  And they, they had a big campaign for it and
0 B:  But they don't want certain types of paper. 
1 B:  Right, they don't want the garbage from your, from your lunch in there. 
0 B:  Right. 
0 recycle everywhere you go. 
0 know what it was, a plant.  It was a paper plant, I guess. 
0 A:  I guess that was a form of it.  But now it's just like, perpetrated into
0 B:  Wow. 
0 A:  Oh, yeah. 
0 B:  It isn't all.  It isn't all.  I know sometimes it is. 
0 B:  I know this place called Mount Trashmore,
0 A:  Mount Trashmore, huh?
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  # and # so the only way to test that is over a,
0 A:  And they are saying, Well, forty years from now we'll,
0 B:  # and # being thrown out because they have no insurance,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  # so # you wind, you wind up getting the people who really want to be
0 A:  I think we have to have something.  We really do. 
0 B:  I mean, even something that says you know look, free major medical for all,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Their mistakes are made. 
1 B:  That would be nice. 
0 B:  It would be a lot better.  Yeah,
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  Well, well I'm a graduate student. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  That, that, that can't be legal. 
0 B:  So, in, in, but in effect, I'm paying twice for one service.  So,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  I mean, if I can't afford to have some kind of volun-, optional operation
1 education and with other things that you hear about and it's just, Wait a
1 B:  That's probably very true. 
1 people, I, do you think it's a sign of the times, that people are starting to
0 B:  Oh, that could be, uh, making up for the difference. 
0 very well in my opinion.  Seems like it takes so long between conviction and
0 carrying out the penalty that I don't see that it makes any difference to
0 faster than they're executing them so it's really building up. 
0 years. 
0 the violent people going against each other and so they, you know, society's
0 A:  Yeah, you know, it makes sense, um, you know, you have the occasional
0 between, uh, you know, makes good T V movies and that's about it.
0 A:  # Yeah.  #

0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 the verdict. 
0 really happen the way the, the prosecutor said it happened, you know, is this
0 B:  # Uh-huh [baby].  #
0 A:  # it, # there's, uh, a death penalty associated with it. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # but, # um, some of these people are just out and out brutal.  I, some of
0 same whether you use cash or credit, I usually use my Discover card and I can
0 of money back.  It's not much, but, you know, five or six bucks.  Uh, instead
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Wha-, yo-, override?
0 B:  If I write a check real large, it'll go ahead and pull it out of my
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  -- so I don't have to, you know, worry about it one way of the other and I
0 just keep that minimum balance in there.
0 B:  there's no charge for it.  
0 B:  Because I'm like you, I'm not going to have a balance on that thing,
0 B:  I know too many people that pay off that car-, well I've got this credit
1 huh-uh, not me.
0 your name, at least either with cash or with a check [throat_clearing] you
0 B:  And then I'll put the card in and pull it out what I want.  But I'll pull
0 B:  But that's still, that's easy enough as it is, but I wouldn't use the
0 machine to pay fifty cents or a dollar for it.
0 it charges a buck.  And one time, it was because the machine at T I was broken
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yeah, over here in, in Plano.
1 my outside activities have been curtailed a lot.  
0 B:   Oh, gosh.   
1 A:   And I don't want her to think of surgery on my knee.  I
1 A:   uh-huh, not my kneecap.  
0 B:   And she lasted about two weeks, and her ankles couldn't take
0 get back into it and start running, uh five K's, and ten K's
0 A:   I can you understand that.   
0 I skipped it then it kind of threw the, the whole, the whole
0 A:   Right boy, hopefully my, my knee is a hundred percent
0 A:   Yes, I did.  Uh, just close to Methodist Hospital.  
0 lawyers and stuff downtown too, are picking up some of those
0 B:   You know.  They're, they're getting four thousand square
1 A:   And the guy that built it was weird, I mean weird. 
0 [laughter].  
0 A:   Oh.  
0 into the fitness center at Methodist and they have a quarter mile
0 A:   We all know each other, and the street doesn't go anywhere. 
0 A:   I mean, it looked darker to him, because he, he was in the
0 whenever you are, you know, so they just don't even care any more.
1 too many students were failing them.
1 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  So in that particular school system, um, that was, that was one of the
0 A:  -- it's something that they want to learn, um, I'm sure you're, you're
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Um, today, well, you're, you're closer to it now than I am.  Um, did you go
0 some people were going to college, so they took certain courses, and some
0 B:  Our math, I think we were very strong in our math.  We were taking tests
0 A:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].
0 very unusual for our school system.  So our English was probably better than
0 share the same office, are doing that, they've pulled their children out, and
0 than my father, and he, you know, he's making like forty-five thousand --
0 B:  -- and a lot of them have like other part, like I know a lot of the
0 well, I know one professor, he comes up from Pittsburgh, you know, and he
0 You can get the notes off someone else and never go to class and just go for
1 A:  That's incredible.  That's in-,
0 boss, or the people that he has to respond to, report to.
1 something, 
1 A:  That's what it sounds like.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 uh, we're, we want a quality education, and we're not getting it.  Let's go on
0 headlines that's for sure.
1 B:  Yeah, I think, uh, I, I'm a, I'm an advocate of, uh, gun control
0 we have, there's so much crime in the adjoining community of Washington, D
0 C,
0 B:  that, uh, we're hoping that they could, you know, if they put in more
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 uh, [lipsmack] it comes in, but that's one reason why, I guess the, the plan
0 months before he actually committed the deed.
0 B:  I think, I think the idea is that they also, uh, my idea, too, is to remove
0 the automatic weapons from, from the markets.  You know, not to be able to
0 B:  Right.  
0 B:  It will,  eliminate some of the, 
1 B:  See, and I don't either, so, and I do have friends.  My brother is a
1 lifelong member of the N R A [laughter].
0 A:  You have to do it gradually,  
0 severely depressed, uh, from, he'd just lost his job,
0 record, it probably would be faster than seven days, you know, but you have to
0 A:  But, are, are there, are there, uh, uh, an equal amount of per capita
0 A:  by other means?  
0 guess.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 everybody's point.  My brother's a member of the N R A.  We argue about this
1 over dinner [laughter].
0 @A:  # and # I'll tell you what they are and, uh, then you, uh, would you
0 B:  # Sure.  #
1 A:  I think that's right, too.  Well, especially THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
0 you say, the, the stack of paper is so large,
1 A:  Just terrible job. 
0 A:  But, it is not written as well as TIME staff, uh, writers do [breathing].
0 A:  # Well, #
1 A:  Right. 
0 A:  Oh, well, of course.

0 never will, but that's kind of like an insurance thing.  I sure like that one. 
0 oil, uh,
0 B:  Now, uh, course you get six months, uh, unemployment from the State --
0 B:  So, uh, I was able to, uh, not just exist.  I mean, I, I lived just as
0 A:  Yeah, they seem to be do-, doing a good job of that.  I'm in facilities,
0 have improved it considerably. 
0 B:  And, of course I've been looking into it but, uh, since I'm only a yellow
0 an account like a four O one account.  I, I've been thinking about that for
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah, and instead of having a, a socialized pension, it just would be
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 ten years,
0 A:  I'm glad it's there, though.

0 and then, you know, some more on the weekends.  
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 physiological ad-, advan-, advantages to it, so I began a program
0 B:   Oh, I see.  
0 up to that.

0 I'm probably of the opinion that, uh, that well, if they really want to, I
0 differences or anything and I just, there are differences, whether we like it
0 and then they, they make it so tough, you know, because it takes a lot of

0 A:  # but # it, it's a real college town and so you know, you have these
1 A:  Nice and quiet, so.  I don't think I could live here much longer but

1 A:  and, um, you know, really didn't interfere because all his life [clicking
0 B:  That's wonderful.  How is it now?  I imagine, you said he's a sophomore?
0 A:  -- and so, actually we don't, I mean we still spend a lot of time 
0 together in the sense that we are always together for dinner and, and, uh,    
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  but more, gee, you know,
0 A:  missed you, you know, this is what's new type of thing and I think we
1 A:  I think part of it is that that we were abroad for a good part of the

0 he was two and a half, 
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  My grandparents,

0 B:  Oh, that sounds great. 
1 in the sun in the upper half of your body,
0 B:  I, I know a lot of friends are really too hyper to fish they have to be
0 A:  # no # pressure, not, not worrying about whether you catch anything or not.
1 [laughter],
0 B:  # Now # in Iowa when they were little, my son I used to take him fishing

1 B:  Yeah.  Well I had, I had a German Shepherd before this one and when she
1 B:  I couldn't even talk about it for months and so I decided well that's
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 Humane Society and got, uh, got another one, a stray.
0 A:  And she, she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years
1 A:  Yeah, it is.  Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  The vet called her, uh, a golden mix [laughter], 
1 B:  eyes are the same color and everything, so.  I named her Rosebud, 
1 she said there's a lot of longevity in that name, said my cow lived seventeen
0 A:  [Laughter] That's not too bad.  Golly the Golden Retriever's are good dogs
0 B:  Yeah, right.
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  This, this friend of mine has, th-, well it's the same guy that was
0 watching, uh, my German Shepherd when he got hit, but, uh, went fishing with
0 B:  Oh, that's good, yeah.
1 in after her.
1 climbed up and then,
1 screaming and made me pull her back out.
1 B:  And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off
1 A:  she could go in sometime when, if I'm watching her, so.
0 B:  Yeah, and she, oh baths.  Oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything.  It
0 was, it was just really a fight to, you know, get her clean.
0 B:  Yeah, and, uh, an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean
0 would go in the lake, it wasn't like he didn't --
1 B:   but that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she
1 husband heard me laughing and he said I can't believe that you're still
0 and it did look like it'd  be a good mo-, movie, but, 
1 A:  No, no.
1 A:  Yeah, well, it's been nice talking to you, we seem to be degenerating here,
1 A:  [Laughter]  Oh no. 
1 have, Berkeley is a very avant-garde recycling city. 
0 formal programs where we are though they're not in our town, I mean Jackie and
0 drop it off at the recycling center but that's about the extent of ours.  Uh,
0 industry has got to get the mind set that what they'd do affects the uni-, you
1 A:  Yeah.  They've switched to that paperboard, the pressboard stuff. 
1 the, the landfills,
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 B:  # inner # areas of them are, are protected. 
1 they don't decompose as rapidly as people say they do so they just buy the
1 ones that don't decompose at all [laughter].
1 A:  I thought that was interesting [laughter]. 
1 little blue things flickering through it but,
1 B:  I think that might give it a little added touch of something, I'm not sure
1 what [laughter], 
0 in our part, we're like right in the middle of the state and you know, we're
1 rolled down the window and just threw them out you know.
1 A:  Oh no! You messed with Texas [laughter]. 
1 A:  Well, you know they have got these Adopt a Highway programs.  They have to
1 B:  -- no one can live down there you know. 
0 the continent yet. 
0 biodegradable and did not damage the, the, uh, environment, you know, I think
1 that, that's got to be, I mean if you could come up with something like that
0 A:  I, I tend to agree and it sure would be nice to see something like that. 
1 B:  Please do. 
0 B:  In terms of control.  
1 B:  However, no, I'm sorry, maybe up to a nine or a ten.  
0 lenient, uh, Texas and Florida are very easy on, uh, gun ownership,
0 A:  And I think that might stop some of the, uh, impulsive crimes.  But, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Yeah.
1 box of bullets.  I suppose I could have gone and blown my own brains out or
1 anyone else's [laughter] who was,
0 A:  But, uh, yeah, we are very tol-, a very tolerant society.  And, uh, it
0 guess this, this, this, this Gulf War came to mind where, where, uh, well, war
0 contributions and, and all kinds of medical aid because that one life is
1 A:  And now it's a national organization.  They, they're very powerful, uh,
0 B:  [Breathing] Yeah it,
1 six or seven people and we were just sitting around drinking beer and the
0 the bedroom dresser, and one somewhere else, but, uh,
1 the owner of the gun who happened to be a police officer [laughter].
1 B:  Um. [laughter], I don't know what that says, it's pretty sad.
0 happen.
0 too.  You can't get them through airports, uh,
1 A:  Germany in the airports there, where there, uh, where terrorism is so much
0 B:  Yeah.  No, I think by the, [laughter] by the, the, the year nineteen
1 A:  What are you going to do about that.  You got two hundred million guns here
1 A:  Well, there, that's your, your professional army.  Uh, that's your first
1 line of defense [laughter].
1 and, and attack other countries, but at, at home here,
0 A:  Probably not. 
0 B:  Uh, I know my wife would [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
0 A:  [Laughter]  That's true. 
0 B:  # and # so forth.  And then, uh, it looked like we just stayed in some sort
0 A:  Okay.  That twenty, twenty-five years ago that Japan wasn't, uh, wasn't
0 B:  # things, must # have been,
0 A:  # And, uh, old, the old Datsuns.  #
1 American, it's just that I've always bought Fords, and I guess I'll just keep
0 B:  # Well, #
1 downhill.  Certain,
0 in, in, in, indebted budgets and the like.
0 B:  # and, # uh, and, uh, I, I, I always felt like, at least the immediate
0 healthy and was a integral part of what made this country, I don't know, sort
0 B:  # country # in terms of discipline, uh, uh, I don't know, some not
0 it is for us, though, to want to do that.
0 lot of them, I guess, don't do it at all so,
1 A:  It's, it's, it's easier to, to fight, I guess, when you can find them
1 [laughter]. 
0 A:  I remember the problem back then was,
0 meeting the me-, the enemy sort of head on instead of doing more feigning and,
0 A:  # You know, I guess it's, its, #
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 any of the other scientific fields,
0 B:  # chemistry # and biology and the like,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them
1 B:  And we've got a eighty-four Toyota that we bought used.  So we've got four
1 was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a, but a
1 B:  And, and, of course you don't buy General Motors products over there
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
1 A:  But, once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them, all of them, you
0 B:  And, uh, uh, I and, you know, we used to think Ford products were tinny.  I
1 mean I was growing up, I was taught when I was growing up, you know, that,
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  That's right.
1 B:  And we drove that down and I hated to turn that back in.  
0 A:  [Lipsmack] I bet [laughter].  
0 A:  (( )).
1 B:  Um.  
0 B:  Oh, yours is small.  
1 A:  Yes.  
0 A:  So, we, uh, so we don't plan on purchasing any more any time soon.  Both of
0 son will graduate from high school this year, and, and he's going to go to
0 a year to get some grades in order, but, uh, the next year when he goes out to
1 A:  A pickup {faint}.
0 A:  Really?  
0 and, and tell him what you want and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy,
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  We'll go somewhere else.  Yeah.  
0 exhausted.  I, I was only twenty-five years old or something --
0 Chevrolet dealership up there.
0 try to cash the check because I'm going to, I've stopped payment on it already
1 And I told him, he says, somebody's taking you for a ride.  And I said, no
0 A:  Well, my sociology class at S M U's taught us that it was not a deterrent.
0 went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent.
0 B:  Oh, there yes.  They are.  That was before the, uh, uh, they adopted the
0 particularly for, uh, well I think Texas has a good, good law.  Uh, crimes,
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 reverse everything. 
0 B:  Yes, very true.  I, uh, I agree with you there.  Uh,
0 it, it's, uh, that's an awful lot to, uh, to expect of a person, to, uh, to
1 B:  Uh-huh {pause}. Yeah, exactly.  Well, anyhow I guess we both agree that,
0 A:  # [Laughter].  #
0 B:  # that # it is,
0 this, too.  I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back
0 A:  Convicted drug dealers. 
0 fortunate with my children and grandchildren, so far that I know.  I qualify
1 that heavily,
0 A:  But it just touches so many young people. 
0 B:  # Well, #
0 cigarette under the table.
0 A:  Yeah, I've seen all of this, yeah [breathing]. 
1 B:  Uh, uh-huh. 
1 A:  -- still [laughter], he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to
0 A:  uh, as far as a rifle or anything like that, 
1 A:  No, unless it's a, like one of those automatic weapons.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  you know.  I'd rather go out with a camera now, 
0 against the law now to, to shoot a firearm off in the town.  And it's, it's
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  and it,
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  So what is he, does he have to follow certain rules and regulations because
0 in Pittsburgh now.  And so he, he really hasn't been doing too much shooting
0 lately.
0 that would suffice.  We wouldn't have to go any further.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah, right.  Ten was no, no restrictions whatsoever.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  [Laughter] I don't know if we solved it but,
1 crazy about guns myself, but being from hunting families I tolerate them
0 A:  That is.
1 year old, and so I need to make sure I've got one that I can fit,
1 B:  Yeah, I, I seem to remember when I was young that was a problem [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 really easy to pull out.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at, uh, possibly the Honda
1 before I think you, you looked at the car you wanted, and then you looked to
0 A:  Or how you could afford it.  
1 A:  I'm not sure I could do much better today.  But, uh, that is also effecting
0 buying a new car [laughter].
1 July fourth seventy-six [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  you're required to wear them.
1 lap portion of it.  I know my brother doesn't and he has one in his car.
1 A:  Make sure you smack him around then [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 car they had a lot of problems,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I remember when that happened.  So unless they're really
0 years and never had a single problem with it.  And it was great.  Uh, and the
0 I'm pretty well sports minded.
1 B:  Um, there's something about holding that club in my hand that I want to
0 A:  I just, uh, haven't taken the time to learn the fundamentals of the game. 
0 A:  # and # think that I can just, you know, use transfer skills from like you
1 A:  # so # I have to aim like forty-five degrees off to the,
0 A:  # to # the right and hopefully it curves back in. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 B:  # He, # he watches every game, he goes out every single day.  His whole
0 that's coming up. 
0 A:  Oh yeah, yeah.  I, we don't have a T V so we don't watch much golf. 
0 A:  # But, you # know, when I was younger, when I was into it, I'd watch it
1 B:  [Breathing] Uh, gosh, I can't en-, remember, you know, all those names kind
1 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  # [Laughter] # And that's what I remember the most about that.  Uh, but I
0 it's, it's incredible, I've, I've never golfed down here because it's, you
1 you know,
1 B:  # you # know, the golf hat, the golf, you know clock, everything. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 You know, make a little megabucks and pass it along, you know, to the family
1 [laughter]. 
1 A:  So, uh, you don't see you, uh, taking up, you know, and charging,
0 B:  # [Laughter].  #
1 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  # [Laughter]  # okay, I've seen a golf club, that's funny. 
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, yeah me too.  It's not, uh, not something like, uh, that
1 A:  [Sigh]  Well if it's genetic, you'd better be careful. 
0 B:  Where they just, you know, go through the list, and whenever you pick up
0 the phone, it's a recording and there, you're supposed to hold on for a very
1 A:  Um. 
1 B:  Almost sort of like these T I phone calls.  No [laughter]. 
1 A:  And so I just do not answer the phone call. 
1 A:  # You # know, I'll let it ring until somebody else answers it.  And if they
0 say, dad, it's for you, I says what are they selling [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah, we get a lot for, uh, aluminum siding. 
0 A:  I consider that to be the invasion of privacy.  Particularly when I'm
0 ten o'clock and they don't call before eight o'clock in the morning.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 is they just go through, down a list of numbers, I mean, they don't know who
0 purposes. 
0 B:  Right, right. 
1 A:  Yeah, the government seems to intervene quite a bit. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh, one of the other complaints I have is, uh, have you ever checked your
0 A:  You ought to do that, it's interesting, tha-, to see who has inquired about
0 B:  And, uh, I've always wondered how and, uh, why.  Now we had a problem not
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 and things like that.
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  # And, uh, should be so, #
0 erroneous.  So, uh, I, I think everybody recommends that, uh, well they've,
0 A:  Uh, it's about five dollars. 
1 convincing the authorities that he wasn't the, the party that was responsible
1 for failing to make child support payments [laughter]. 
1 telling me here? 
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 to, uh, not only be, uh, mother, uh, nurturer, or whatever but she also has to,
1 problems we have in, in, uh, uh, juvenile delinquency, whatever, probably can
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  That's the kind of, uh, what would it be, uh, uh, calming influence or
0 either want attention or because they, they feel that they're not worthy --
1 A:  Wha-, what do you feel about, how do you feel about the role of women, uh,
0 was probably to a degree true for them.  I mean it's no longer the case where,
0 --
0 how things are likely to continue to change, uh, in the immediate future. 
1 A:  I, I think that's probably true.  I think one of the problems is that, that
0 government in their meddling [laughter]  tends to encourage that,
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  Right. 
0 B:  #I agree# with you. 
0 B:  the greater acceptance of part-time jobs.  
0 A:  That's right.  It's not, and, and, and the, the problem is you see, tha-,
0 the changes, about, uh, uh, more women going for, for, uh, better educations
0 B:  #Right.# 
0 important.#
0 a nurse,
0 it's a neat thing to watch because he's as [beep] adept at it as she is.
1 reruns of HAPPY DAYS,
1 teenagers to go, 
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 activities?
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  Yes.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 social life completely --
1 B:  Yeah, it is.
1 like to eat but,
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  We've, um, we've bought Pictionary,
1 A:  It really is,
1 A:  I personally think that I should have been born in the fifties because --
0 A:  You know, it just seems like you didn't have so much to worry about
1 A:  You know, I, I don't know if you're familiar with any of them but,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 so, um, exclusive.  #You know# --
1 the, the next room could be on fire,
0 A:  and they'll never know it, you know.
0 B:  Oh, that's the truth.
1 A:  Yeah, and gosh, I hope you guys cool off down there.
1 B:  Yeah [laughter] (( )).
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # so # many different jobs, which I think is terrific. 
0 career, plus, because I always have a job plus I am a single parent, too,
0 B:  But, uh, and I think that's the reason why a lot of women have, have
0 A:  I think that's right. 
0 money, and, and most all, they always either have [breathing]  they're either
0 moonlighting or else their, their wife works, too. 
0 A:  I really think women have so much more responsibility than, you know, as
0 B:  Oh, definitely. 
0 B:  And, uh, [breathing]  but I'm all, I'm really grateful that I went to
0 except I was twelve.  And my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make
0 going to see some, a lot more changes, uh, hopefully, that women are, you know,
0 A:  I think they're going to stay there and I think that they're going to, uh,
1 children,
0 A:  Good to talk to you, Sally. 
1 @A:  Uh, I don't have a family budget but we do have a budget already
1 [laughter]. 
1 an, accountant and my wife manages most of the money so,
0 that, if both parties know that what has to be spent, then there's not going to
0 B:  And, and then plus if there's any, uh, you know, tragedy, or anything in
0 B:  Right. 
0 B:  Yeah, most, most young, young couples starting out think, uh, well, I've
1 got, you know forty years [cough] {someone in background} before I need to
1 A:  Yeah, and they say oh, well, we have the money we might as well spend it
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 car with sixty-three thousand miles on it.
1 B:  Right [laughter]. 
1 after one year it started heating only on one side.
1 B:  Huh, so either you or your husband can be warm but not both [laughter]. 
1 B:  Wal-Mart, I was going to say, it must have been Wal-Mart. 
1 A:  Yes [laughter]. 
0 A:  That was poor quality, I think. 
0 B:  Yeah, I don't usually, but I did that one. 
1 A:  You're really divulging very personal information. 
1 minutes. 
1 A:  And Norma, it is just wonderful to talk to you. 
0 B:  Good talking to you too, I've enjoyed it [laughter]. 
1 it all the time.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  You know something must be wrong as far as, uh, mak-, not just the
0 teaches school here in Plano.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  because you spend so much time there.
0 or, or something, 
0 years ago and he's going to, he, he will have gone to school five years.
0 you know, plays a definite part.  And, you know, 
0 and, you know, it just, it, it was there, it was just, I guess school was not
1 uh, you know, education's wasted on the youth anyway.  
0 know, these people are, you know, taking a tremendous amount of my time,
0 A:  Ex-, exactly.
1 program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing, but.  
0 A:  [Laughter] [breathing]  Um.
0 B:  The, uh, the cure, some of the cures that I've heard for this that, that
1 if it's socialist, or I don't care, 
0 of the homes, you know.
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  But, um, yeah, there's definitely problems,
0 A:  Uh-huh, [throat_clearing] uh-huh.
0 A:  I mean, I've only been out of, I've been out of college only two years,
1 B:  more than two years ago, I guarantee, 
0 B:  -- uh, uh, [lipsmack].  Gosh we haven't done anything, uh, real major.  Uh,
0 can get down here. 
1 B:  No, it well, we bought the house new and, uh, it was kind of the, you know,
1 B:  No, no. 
1 A:  You kind of have to dig a trench, right?
0 A:  # so I've, # you know, have not owned a home yet --
0 rooms.  Uh, but I don't think, you know, being a new home we wouldn't do any
0 kind of major remodeling like redoing the kitchen, or anything like that. 
1 did a lot of remodeling in that house.  And, of course, had plumbing put in
0 B:  # with # that kind of thing and so,
1 uh, uh, [lipsmack]  self-contained apartment, so, uh, and it was ni-, nice. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  That's always nice,
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 B:  Yeah, of course he's, he built the shelves in the, in the garage for me
0 B:  And, uh, he's still, you know, very active.  But, you know, the hand's just
0 sixties and seventies.  He used to climb out on the roof and do stuff and --
1 [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  Uh, our first house, uh, a real small house and,
0 A:  Um. 
0 B:  -- so I was, I mean we were just paying incredible bills during the long,
0 [noise].
0 B:  And you could get it really cheap when it was green. 
0 A:  And, uh, [breathing]  like I said, I'm looking forward to [breathing], 
0 B:  Yeah, that, I think that, that's always fun and, and, you know you can save
1 A:  Uh, not even a year yet. 
0 A:  You know and,
0 much volunteer as far as separating, oh, paper and bottles, and, you know, cans
0 been on the plastic trash bag business where everything was just, uh, put in,
1 all be mulched at once, the paper sack and everything.  Only problem is you
0 section of Massachusetts.  It comes down like kind of a neck, so,
0 B:  # it turns out that, uh, # on a, a Sunday morning after a Dallas Saturday
1 night there's enough aluminum cans and stuff along the road,
0 A:  So that's what [throat_clearing], we've been doing that for the last couple
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  -- so, there's more and more people, too are aware of that up here, and
1 A:  When it gets,
1 see, there was what, was it Massachusetts, I remember here a couple of years
0 A:  I'm not really sure.  Uh,
0 B:  Over in Fort Worth they had one catch fire here a couple of years ago and
0 they had an awful time putting it out. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 B:  Uh, yeah.  Uh, the panhandle, the, the, there's, well, there's several
1 are bigger than Rhode Island. 
1 that project on myself and that's a little harder [breathing].  Uh,
1 A:  Well, my kitchen ceiling has needed painting for, uh, four years now,
1 [laughter], 
1 B:  So that, that's a lot of, uh, yeah, you've got your work laid out for you. 
1 A:  Right.  I figure by, by, doing it before I put in the carpeting, [laughter]
0 A:  I think, it's, sh-, I don't know, my, my impression is, it's more like four
1 y-, four years it starts needing it and people usually get around to it at five
0 B:  Uh, I, I thought so, you know, I would say no less than, definitely no less
0 than five.  I think if your exterior paint is peeling after a year or two then
0 seemed like last year everybody was going crazy to have their exterior painted
0 B:  -- but, yeah the trim and most people were doing it last year for the first
0 A:  Right. 
0 these houses soaks so much of the paint in.
1 B:  # so # I'm not, I'm not sure two years would be too often.  I don't want to
1 do it that oft-, [laughter]. 
1 painting that much like, yes, uh, it's okay for a while.  But I find it gets,
1 A:  But,
1 B:  So [laughter], 
1 A:  Small world [laughter]. 
1 B:  # No.  #
0 about a half an hour, an hour and peel it off and [lipsmack] it's a perfect
0 clean line.  And, and I've found that it can also be used, uh, well, like I've
0 as wide as four inches.  The glue on it is not across the whole thing.  It's
0 A:  # Oh.  #
0 even get it on the tape itself and then whenever the paint is dry, most
0 B:  # up # near the ceiling in the living room.  I've put the tape along there
0 as [talking],  you don't get drips as, well, you can get drips,
0 B:  # you # have to be a little careful,
0 at doing that.  I've found that the tape works,
1 A:  Now even with tape I think, I was just thinking of using the pads instead
1 A:  # have # to ask her what the trick is.  She'll probably say hire me to come
0 down and do it [laughter]. 
1 terms of how you have to be positioned to do them,
1 A:  # Right [laughter].  #
1 A:  Right.  That's why I want to do the kitchen first.  I figure I can stand on
1 the kitchen table [laughter]. 
1 should, you know, is fine.  I think it should be by a jury.  I don't think the
0 A:  I never have either, but my friends, my few friends who have, uh, say just
0 come out and I, I know they automatically, when you go through, uh, when you're
0 something like that, that you're automatically, no they don't want you on the
0 by a jury of my peers.  I'd be, I mean I'd be tried by a jury of [breathing],
1 apparently they thought I served so I didn't, I didn't make any noise about it
1 [laughter]. 
1 country at the time, so I'm pretty sure I didn't.  Uh,
0 A:  And, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or
0 pitches, you know, the prosecutor will want to, [breathing]  oh, I don't know
0 you know, it's just a big faceless corp-, corporation.  Let's, let's make them
0 alone. 
0 A:  Well, how about having a j-, jury and a judge work together on it somehow?
1 too much, though.
1 B:  Exac-, (( )) judge [laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  They pay that judge, they pay those jury members very little
1 A:  He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together. 
0 B:  Probably, yeah [laughter].  Yeah.  But, uh, no, it's, it's sad, though,
0 looking for someone whose face they think will, you know, want to hang
0 They're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned or
0 mean, I know, it, it, it's tricky because I know, you know, an awful lot of
1 A:  Right.  Course, they'd be, they would be barred, but [laughter], 
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  I hope we're called up before too long. 
1 B:  I would love to be called, I'm ready to go [laughter].  They just haven't
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Bye-bye. 
0 B:  Well, we, uh, uh, this will be, uh, uh, the reunion for not my grandfather,
0 A:  Are you going to # do it over a weekend?#
0 my brothers and sisters and their families will come so that [breathing] we
0 can get acquainted and then, uh, it goes back the, the generation before will
1 together so that the next time somebody says reunion, they won't run like
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 swimming and whatever during the, uh, in the area roundabout, which they will
0 had my grandfather's family and, uh, we only did it for one day. 
0 there's some of us come from quite a ways. 
0 wasn't too expensive, but [breathing], uh, could be more of a vacation
0 ancestors up until, uh, fairly recently.  At this point, in that generation
0 this time had some access to this park --
0 to take what was left.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 at least a year ahead of time or you're going to lose people, you know, they
0 have to plan their vacations that far ahead a little bit. 
1 A:  Wow.  Sounds like you guys are, uh, your family's really into family. 
0 A:  Not very many, no. 
0 A:  It, too, it's, it was a large transition, let me tell you. 
1 A:  # twenty-five # or thirty people. 
0 A:  So getting names and faces and jobs and where they live and everything
1 A:  But, uh, they, uh, they make a big deal out of everything. 
1 A:  Yeah.  Uh, I guess so, uh,
0 B:  [Laughter]  It really is quite a lot of fun. 
0 A:  # and, # you know, so we get,
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  And, um, I'd, I'd probably buy another, this is the first American vehicle
0 the dealership that I purchased it from but as far as, uh, the quality seems
1 A:  Oh really?
1 B:  Oh.
0 own one of those either [laughter].
0 A:  I mean, I've never had any problem with it.
0 A:  Um, I like anything besides Japanese.  Of course everything has Japanese
1 B:  That's the way it goes, I guess.  
0 B:  Uh, excellent warranty, I mean, just, unbelievable warranty.  And, and,
1 my attitude and it, it will never change about that place.
1 B:  That's why I, I wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what.
0 it.
0 A:  You mean, uh, fifty percent pollution total --
0 keeps running good and not costing me any money.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Yeah, and, uh,
0 second time.
0 A:  (( )) too.
0 A:  we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of
0 particularly on industry.  Uh, we have good policing, at least in this state
0 A:  Do you all have that?
0 state.
0 everything for safety or,
1 certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh,
0 B:  Oh yeah, I, I agree.  Now that's another area we haven't even discussed and
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 uh, physical responsibility there. 
0 [breathing], are an accepted way and, in a way, 
0 there's a joke about the, uh, Ambassador from Latin America that came to visit
0 I'll show you and he walked out in the backyard and the, uh, Senator said do
1 fifteen percent, so,
0 hospital over there? And the Senator looked and he couldn't see anything, he
0 said, no.  And the Ambassador potted, patted his pocket and said one hundred
1 percent so,
0 things, the cholera,
0 A:  Right.  And they, they're very,
1 think that when they [breathing]  receive help from us, they want it, but, they
1 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 elsewhere in Latin America the, uh, the money that they apparently need and
1 A:  -- in the long run in how much they're trying to do,
1 B:  And in the short run probably [laughter], too. 
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Well, have we come up with a solution yet, Salina?
1 B:  No, not that I know of [laughter]. 
0 B:  I appreciate it, and, and tell your wife I hope we, I get her again
1 sometime, too.  This is fun,
0 supposed to talk about, but it was, uh, basically what's your views on, whether
0 B:  Right.  And, uh, I don't know, I've, I've always thought that any, uh,
1 B:  -- when that's done, and, uh.  Yeah, how do you feel about it?
0 B:  Right.  If, if the (( )) evidence wasn't overwhelming, right?
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  -- anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it.  I don't, do you know if
1 A:  I know Florida has it. 
1 B:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah [laughter], 
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 some of the,
0 and then they [breathing] they start stiffening the penalties. 
0 premeditated murders are committed,
0 B:  So, of course, the, the attorneys,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
1 know, a, a month or two, or six years, he's still going to get, you know, the
0 B:  You know. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take
0 their life also.  But, uh, but, are, are you, would you draw the line there
1 mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison.  I
1 B:  Off earlier.  But some of these guys just don't care,
1 B:  # you # know.  And so, uh,
1 B:  Oh, okay.  I don't think I really know that. 
0 tend to, to support capital punishment, where the places that are, you know,
0 circumstances where you hear about these people that have, you know, stolen
1 you know, I mean, that is just --
1 B:  But not how they're going to ((sentence you)),
0 they plea bargain or not, if they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of
1 B:  Right, uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  I was just saying that way, what they're saying is that they can't
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 in are, are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways but,
0 outside care I probably would stay away from professional child care centers
0 B:  Uh-huh, and everything in between, yeah, in most states there's nothing to
1 A:  Yeah, yeah that's, that's very well phrased. 
0 A:  -- our step daughter's ten now --
1 A:  -- and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma. 
0 B:  That's true.  You can get somebody maybe willing to baby-sit but actual,
0 that was how it was this Virginia, we've recently moved here to Texas, but in
1 --
0 A:  Yes, very --
0 know, she was an only child, or maybe your daughter,
0 B:  # the # reason, that's done through example, you know, not an actual sit
0 B:  Uh-huh, it is [laughter]. 
1 A:  Their employees earn almost nothing. 
0 that [laughter].
1 A:  like I said,
0 A:  Yeah, okay. 
1 A:  I, I hadn't been down in that part of the state really. 
1 frequently. 
1 A:  Uh, I wish we did [laughter]. 
0 B:  -- so, we're, we take trips pretty often. 
0 A:  Uh-uh. 
0 B:  -- and down, oh, we were just out recently at the outer banks of North
1 Carolina. 
1 A:  All these places that I've never been [laughter]. 
0 B:  Is that right [laughter].  Where do you go?
1 A:  # but, uh, I, uh,#
0 B:  Yeah, uh-huh. 
1 A:  Yeah, it's, it's really neat.  It's this house built on, on a waterfall and
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Um, of course, we keep picking crummy weather to go out there,
1 A:  # uh, # the first time we went out there was, uh, the day after hurricane
1 Hugo had come through [laughter]. 
1 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night.
0 another,
0 B:  We really didn't do that really this time, we just, uh, visited around. 
1 A:  Uh, uh,
0 probably another twenty years. 
0 father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles, so, my father
1 to Disneyland about five times,
1 A:  # in one # year and I really have no great urge to go back now. 
1 B:  it's a real pretty place. 
1 A:  Uh, yeah, one of these days we'll get down there, although [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  # to # go, and, uh,
0 kind of like a little, a little thing sticking out, uh, [laughter] in the Lake
1 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  Yeah, they call it the Cape Cod of the, uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh, sounds good. 
1 B:  Well, I don't know what our next trip will be, I guess our next, well, I
1 A:  # Oh, boy.  #
1 B:  # so my # next trip is going to be to Texas [laughter]. 
1 A:  Well, yeah, you won't even,
1 B:  # [Laughter].  #
1 Texas, I go, okay, that the connection,
1 B:  # That's it, yeah [laughter].# 
1 B:  Is that right. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  -- and, uh, we got back Monday [squeak] and I got a call yesterday
1 A:  # from # the lab. 
0 B:  No, uh-huh,
1 A:  Except our outside (( )), though. 
1 B:  # Oh, #
1 A:  # weekend # [laughter]. 
0 just sight see a little bit sometime. 
0 myself when I go out somewhere because there's so many people, they're crazy
0 A:  you know, and so,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  but you can get them anywhere, 
0 B:  The law's just, you know, they can't enforce what they have --
0 A:  Right.  
0 they'll try and find a small one to fit inside their purse --
0 A:  Right, uh-huh.  I mean you,
0 B:  #if you get one, you know,#
0 anywhere at night, anywhere, I mean if I'm just stepping outside my door I
0 carry something on me.  If I'm, you know, going up to my door and I don't have
0 A:  Yes, my boyfriend,
0 A:  Yeah,
0 things that, that, I don't, I don't like to have to carry them,
0 B:  and, and actually they're breaking into the homes, 
0 A:  Oh, do they?  
0 A:  Uh, uh, uh. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- #you know, and he had,#
0 what are they going to do, they're going to punch your name in the computer
0 and you're going to come up as, no you're not a criminal and no, and no you
0 A:  That's a very deadly weapon.  
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  bless you -- 
0 on the ground, you know, for in the United States --
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  -- but, uh, see that's, it's just another piece of paperwork it asks for
1 you answer no to all of them that means you're a good American,
0 B:  -- we've got boxes full in the back room -- 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, my gosh. 
0 work, uh, you know, other people how you interact, has it's gotten easier on
0 A:  # and, #
0 tried in, you know, going into a man's,
0 A:  # Yes, #
1 B:  # and # so,
0 --
0 B:  -- of what it use to be like --
0 B:  it easier on you at, at work. 
1 A:  Well,
0 the ones that were reared in the states --
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  # and # they are just like, you know, who is this girl [laughter]? 
0 B:  # Yeah [laughter].  #
0 even had a problem,
0 A:  I, I don't, I don't see how I can ever get back on track.  I don't see,
0 A:  # I # mean, that was what I did every week and, but I don't, not only, I
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  -- but I don't want to,
1 A:  -- #I don't even think,#
0 A:  I would go interview again. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  yeah, yeah.  I, I hear that, uh, there's all men in my group, I'm, I'm one
0 know, thinking, well, you know, if I, I could spend more time then they could
0 A:  -- it's that they see routinely that you deal with the, you know, with the
1 Children's,
0 A:  # Uh-huh, #
0 this,
1 B:  # from this # seventy hour work person to somebody that goes, God, I ready
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  It is the most life changing experience I have,
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 businesses go through in terms of accidents,
0 A:  And, you know, the, the problem in the work place is that, that people are,
0 come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and,
0 B:  # Right.  #
0 B:  But, what do you do about,
0 A:  # [Throat_clearing].  #
1 B:  Yeah.  I guess so.  I guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the
0 B:  That's true. 
0 A:  And that's probably the biggest problem there is #[throat_clearing].# 
1 A:  # [Throat_clearing].  #
0 B:  all of that.  So that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's, I
1 B:  Yeah.  I know,
1 A:  It happens a lot. 
1 B:  but I guess it does [laughter]. 
0 B:  # Yeah.  I guess so.  #
0 apparently test, um, [noise]  back a certain period of time. 
0 A:  Because (( )) some of the, the residue ends up in your hair follicles, you
0 A:  So {whispering},
1 cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or --
0 B:  Yeah.  That's true [laughter]. 
0 B:  still not getting a real good picture. 
1 A:  [Breathing]. 
0 with buttons.  As soon as you get [/noise]  them home, the buttons fall off,
0 they think they want a certain brand or a certain item, well, when you buy a
0 A:  and,
0 made in the U S A because I think that's important.  And yet, I find a lot of
0 car because I had had a Toyota and I really liked it, but I felt like
0 [swallowing] I needed to b-, buy something that was American made.  I felt I
0 owed that.  Well, I just could not find an American made car that I felt was
0 B:  # uh, # in trucks [noise]  I think you're pretty safe.  But, in cars, I've
0 B:  # inside, # uh, you know, frequent tune-ups.  Every foreign car I've ever
0 B:  brakes on it and, uh, and have the, the reliability,
0 idea that, that quality is important and,
0 A:  # that, #
0 B:  if you can see the transition, what I'm beginning to see is that,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  I know we have the technology, but I think it's the, the glut of the oil
0 B:  -- in trying to control things that they shouldn't control and, uh, they're
0 B:  # especially when # I'm paying for it. 
0 A:  That's right.  Because you,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 one that, um, you know, I only have to pay a couple of thousand or, you know,
0 B:  -- pretty much.  And, and even used trucks are pretty expensive. 
0 forced to get one, we will. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  #Plano?#
0 B:  [Laughter]  Have a big family, I guess, that's a start. 
0 A:  # Okay so you ha-, #
0 B:  Right, every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, uh,
0 B:  Yeah and, uh, [throat_clearing] you know, there's some my age and then
0 B:  # I think # if you can count on it every four years then people have it in
0 A:  Therefore, they don't have many people left. 
0 family and that's been very nice, with, uh, I have one sister,
1 A:  # but, # uh, still, uh, they're not done on a regular basis and, uh, you
0 A:  # Or you # go to Indiana on that?
1 A:  Well I, uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now. 
0 B:  [Laughter] Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation the
0 next one was when I graduated from college, so I guess about two more years.
1 A:  Yes, well, and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you
1 [laughter].
0 A:  I mean you need another milestone, you know. 
0 B:  Oh, really. 
1 A:  # but # anyway, uh, I guess we're supposed to be talking about family
1 reunions aren't we [laughter]. 
1 A:  But I got off that. 
0 A:  Yes, well, um, I think we have been talking probably about four and a half
0 B:  Oh, okay. 
1 B:  Oh yeah. 
0 A:  [Laughter] But it has been fun talking to you. 
0 your seniority level, but, um just to try new things and, and see new areas
0 twice a week for automation specialist training.
0 know, move on into advanced machinery type operations,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 young folks come in and, and gals and guys both and some gals will say I kno-,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
1 B:  It is, I, I'm, that amazes me, tha-,
0 B:  # Uh, # because I could probably turn it on before I get the screen to go
1 completely blank, you know.
1 B:  But now I'm in to Lotus and word processing and I can hold my own with that
0 B:  But, um,
0 B:  # And then if you # have extra days out for what other reasons, uh, there
0 B:  # and et # cetera.  So I mean you are allowed a certain number of days, o-,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  Right. 
1 vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded I guess, but. 
1 B:  #So that's a problem, you know, that's a problem.#  Pardon me. 
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 very very helpful.
0 B:  You sound u-, like a very young person. 
1 A:  All right. 
1 I'm, I agree with you.  And I was hoping to find someone that,
1 A:  # disagreed, #
1 A:  so I could, so, I, I could fire questions at them. 
0 B:  Well, I, ((y-, y-,)) just, uh, like I say, I just think it's a, a fine
0 B:  [Throat_clearing]  But, and then I think that's perfectly, I don't think
0 A:  What do you think company should do if they find someone that tests
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  I'm sure you can at any high school or any street corner they tell me, but
0 --
0 A:  See, that's a question I'm wondering because I'm pursuing a career in
0 A:  And, you know, they're deciding that in the courts, you know, as I'm
0 continuing my education. 
0 A:  I would definitely want to know if these people have AIDS.  I mean, I'm n-,
0 if they don't want to.  You know, why take a chance? Like that doctor in New
1 B:  Yeah.  Totally boring [laughter].  Mother [laughter]. 
0 everybody.  You can't work where I work unless you're tested for it and so
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 Orlando.  Just, oh, yeah.  Just hated it.  Couldn't wait to get back.  And, it
1 took me about almost four years to get back, but I made it. 
0 B:  And, [laughter]  but I've almost doubled my salary since leaving T I.  Now
0 I.  I w-, I really enjoyed working there.  And, uh, but, you know, it wasn't to
0 the dealers out and, you know, I just, makes me sick.  I, [throat_clearing] 
0 B:  I know #when I,#
0 A:  Huh. 
0 B:  And haven't had a s-, puff since.  She gave shots in the nose and in the
0 on Speaker A's portion of the tape, it was pretty difficult to 
0 A:  Okay.  Credit cards.  They leave a bad taste in my mouth.
0 B:  Yeah.  That's got to be like,
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 A:  Yeah.  But, uh, that's, uh, I'll never own another joint, 
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 A:  Because they wasn't even mentioned in the divorce decree --
0 A:  -- as to which party would pay w-, what.
1 A:  That's right.
0 B:  um, had a similar situation.  And then it was almost like he couldn't get a
0 A:  And, uh, and it also makes it bad because you can't deduct that interest
0 B:  #Right.#  
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 uh, uh, not until I sell it.
0 as a rental property and it's not,
0 B:  And, um, I'm living here in New York.  So, I ca-, I can't even vote here.
0 A:  Huh.
0 B:  and so it's like Texas.  Texas doesn't either.
0 --
0 B:  of credit cards.  I think the best, uh, thing maybe is that even though
0 A:  Right.
1 A:  Yeah.  #Well,#
1 B:  #Yeah,# I know that feeling [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, really?
1 B:  Oh, right.  Yeah. 
0 A:  And I, I know that it's a four hour dedication.  It could be four hour
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  # uh, # and not, not having that much fun [laughter].
0 B:  # [Throat_clearing].  #
0 A:  # can # think of one at all. 
1 B:  I guess come to think of it I've never heard a tennis,
1 A:  # [Laughter].  #
0 A:  # Oh, yes.  #
1 [laughter], 
0 A:  # [Laughter].  #
0 but knowing how far to bring it back and the, the concentration and all the
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 fairways sometimes just thinking about that and then, of course, I'll miss the
1 putt [laughter].
1 A:  In fact, that's the onl-, that areas the only place I know of that you
1 really have to, uh, consider the wind on putts [laughter]. 
0 A:  Out on the grass, green and,
0 B:  Yeah, but, I guess in North Carolina you, you're in an area where there are
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # uh, # the courses are beautiful and you can play just about year round on
0 December and January,
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 Norman, and it would play New Year's day down there.  Now ther-, it was
1 stretching the imagination to enjoy it but [laughter], 
0 B:  Yeah.  I have enjoyed it too.  I, I really intend to play golf in the
0 that communism is, is as strong as it once was.  And I'm not sure that, that
0 we were --
0 A:  No.  I really believe it's because, I think it has something to do with
0 oil, don't get me wrong.
0 B:  # Yeah, #
0 B:  Oh, sure.  Well, and there's a lot,
0 and liars too. 
0 A:  So what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi? Are we going
0 scares me so much about it.  I mean I thought the war was going to go on and
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Right, they were. 
0 B:  Oh, sure.  Sure. 
1 A:  And it's not their job to fight for their own land. 
0 see that's another thing that, that's difficult for Americans, their culture
0 A:  The, uh, U S Army is doing it all. 
0 job?  Is, are we, should we still be there even, you know? I don't know the
1 A:  And, do you have a housekeeper?
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Oh, that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it?
1 A:  Oh, okay. 
1 B:  We got a great topic [laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  I know.  I'm sitting here going oh, dear [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  Should we give it a try?
1 B:  I guess we might as well [laughter]. 
1 B:  Okay. 
1 A:  Well, um, so [laughter], 
1 B:  Let you start [laughter], 
1 B:  What changes, uh,
0 A:  Well, actually,
0 Is it, perhaps, woman in politics is for the future.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  # because # it doesn't, it doesn't really help the cause in the long run

0 B:  But not at the college level. 
1 A:  # chairmen.  #
1 or, or just don't, or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs. 
1 B:  None of the above [laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.

0 A:  Yeah, I'm sure there are, yeah. 
1 A:  # either.  # I mean it's just, because I'm in the humanities it's just,

1 A:  # to school # in the morning and be home when the children or child,
0 A:  # comes # home in the afternoon.

1 B:  # it would, it # wouldn't have been a ((doubter)).
1 A:  carrying our own prejudice [laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Oh, gee. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Because if, yeah, if, if somebody does if and breaks tradition you're
1 surprised.  But if [laughter]. 
1 A:  Oh, dear.  So, so,
1 B:  I think maybe more men would like to be if they [laughter]  --
1 A:  If they could get away with it [laughter]. 
1 B:  -- weren't put down so badly [laughter]. 
0 A:  No.  I was a department chairman.  I, but I don't like administration.

1 A:  Oh, jeez. 
1 A:  # for, you know, # even,
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  So I, I figure, you know, nobody must, uh, nobody must like it.  It must be
1 a rotten job for everybody [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Right. 
0 B:  Of course, I don't know how many of them were, you know, not in their right
0 A:  Right.

0 A:  # that, # that's what would just really kill me.

1 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 and let the people pet them. 
0 A:  Oh. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 because, um, many of them, of course, their minds are not good. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  Yeah.  #
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # and # tell me something that they did and then the next time I go it's

0 B:  And, um, he's blind and he has seizures, you know,
0 A:  # Right.  #
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  And so that would probably just tear me apart. 
0 B:  # and # the people love them. 
0 A:  I'm sure. 
0 B:  And they want the children, you know, to hug them or hold their hand and,

0 A:  # with # the younger children.  They'll be telling them all kinds of

0 B:  Oh, I know.  I'm always afraid like, oh, no, what if I lose my mind. 
1 A:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Am I going to end up in a place like that [laughter]?

0 fog never makes it that far. 
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  And I think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three
0 B:  Have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree,
0 A:  Yeah, quite a bit. 
1 the way. 
0 B:  Oh.  Oh, well that's real nice because I can remember two years ago that in
0 about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just

0 B:  And, uh, to come here, it's kind of the temperate weather all year round. 
0 It's kind of like, uh, Spring, I guess, if you, year round, except, and then in
1 B:  But it's a really nice, uh, change of pace. 
1 A:  I guess I'd prefer that [laughter].

0 it.  And, uh, they get the snow, but they said it doesn't really get messy and
1 B:  Oh, gosh.  Well, I hope it moves up this way, but I'm sure it won't

0 do it ourselves in kind of a slow process, but we learned how to do, uh,
1 A:  It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof, isn't it [laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  Yes [laughter]. 
0 to, uh, take care of their, of a household, you know, like, uh, fixing
1 linoleum down.  So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was and
1 A:  Yeah.  All right.  Happy home repairing. 
1 B:  Got three bedrooms, one bath and that just makes me scream. 
0 A:  Oh, okay.  I see.  Is that pretty typical for your area?
0 you can end up doing more with them, it seems like.  What about yard space? Do
0 A:  Oh, I see. 
0 B:  # if # your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow. 
0 we have quite a few parties, and uh, seems like everyone that lives around us,

0 compare yourself to any thing around there.

1 if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years

1 part of the rat race.  I want to be basically just kind of left alone. 
0 A:  Yeah.  It sounds like you enjoy working outside as well.  I, I,
0 haven't done that, yet.  I've had finals this week.  So, uh,
1 that tomato plant, so I hate to spray them with anything.  Um, what do you do?
0 B:  Eventually, if we stay here, I'm going to have to rewire the entire house. 
1 another bath on.
1 B:  So that.  It's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning. 
1 A:  Really.  That could account for a lot of marital problems [laughter].  I
1 think [laughter].

0 B:  That's a real good, um, he talks about that.  Talks about high risk factors

0 I've always come out aces.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  low in fat and all that kind of stuff.  But, I mean as far as really
0 B:  Um, apparently it's getting worse, I mean,
0 plant is doing, and we as consumers have to be prepared to pay a higher cost
1 there, will you give them to me.

0 A:  Do you have any strong opinions on that?
0 B:  Yep, and I think the real problem wasn't the regulation, which I supported,

0 insurance.

1 B:  Wow. 
1 B:  Uh, uh, wow, why base five?

0 B:  But she doesn't have that big a garden, but she has a bigger one than I do.
0 A:  # I think so too.  #
0 B:  # and, # uh, we grow a lot of tomatoes, uh,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  But it's, you know, it's a problem that's, that's moving south from, from
1 A:  Great.  Well, we could ch-, we could really talk gardening a long time.
1 I'm enjoying hearing you so much [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, that's great, that's great. 
1 B:  Well, I hope you have a, an opportunity to garden again. 
1 A:  Oh, I think so, I have a little spinach [laughter]. 
0 B:  # trips home and they # had to figure one airline, uh, trip home and at
0 I went to a state school.
1 B:  My folks kind of had a unwritten rule, there were nine of us and we all
0 premise being that, uh, if you, you know, part of college is being far enough
1 that that's, was some of the focus, although, I think they relaxed that I was
0 give her transportation if it's necessary,
0 A:  # and # of course, I'd like her to live in the dorm if it's possible.
0 little part-time job to earn just a little extra spending money and that sort
0 A:  # preliminary, # uh, application. 
1 so, I, I know [throat_clearing]. 
1 involved in some of the arts things and, you know, that is provided.  I've
0 you know, going back to my own experience of, oh, gosh, you know, if my kids
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 they can come home. 
1 A:  But I prefer colleges that don't stress that as the major focus. 
0 B:  ((Now)), me too [laughter]. 
1 B:  And at that point, did you almost say, gee, I going to have to get out of
1 B:  Have you been sorry?
1 A:  No.  Not at all.  So [laughter]  it,
1 A:  Uh, but it,
0 before they're even eligible for pro ball. 
0 from, you know, from stressing the athletics and extracurricular activities and
0 B:  # Well, #
0 A:  Too many?
0 B:  The ones I like are the ones that are simple and cheap. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 sled in other words. 
0 that or,
0 Um, let's see, uh, I like to play cards.  Uh, don't watch any T V though
1 some friend's house and we'll watch a ball game or something.
1 times, maybe see Nolan pitch one time.
0 they'll probably have to pay a, some compensation of some sort, for that. 
1 A:  Oh, that's terrible.  ((Should show)) a little bit of,
0 A:  Yeah? Were you just out on loan or something or,
0 B:  # when, # uh, automatic chokes were common in automobiles, well, we had a
0 A:  No, kidding,
0 B:  Yeah, we have a lot of electronic stuff there as well, but what I described
0 A:  Huh.  So, how did you like Kokomo?
0 A:  Well, you said something about, uh, the blithe of Dallas, uh, do you live
0 wouldn't want to be out at night, let's put it that way, in that area.
0 uh, book of Hoyle. 
1 B:  That we learned and pinochle and, uh, flabbergash, ever hear that? I bet
0 A:  # I read, read Hoyle # too,
0 A:  # not the whole # book,
0 B:  {Very faint} Yeah. 
1 A:  No. 
0 A:  So, at least I got the scouting report ((so far)).
1 don't believe in playing cards so, you could,
1 B:  # but # it's okay to play dominos so you, forty-two is called Baptist
0 A:  Play backgammon or anything like that?
0 played it in, uh, teams but,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 area who came out and played all of us [laughter], 
1 B:  And he also played us, uh, blindfold chess. 
1 going along, uh, he says, uh, mate in six, and if you play chess, you know, six
0 is a long way ahead [laughter], 
0 B:  But he played us, uh, on a round-robin where he walks around the tables and
1 B:  No, it's too long ago,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 faster he got around.
1 and expect him to learn something.
0 A:  And then, yeah, you do have to pay, you know, if you, the better the place,
0 B:  Yeah, but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway [laughter]. 
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # for more than, #
0 and also, um, senior care facilities, you know, you hear abuse. 
0 B:  # yeah, # working in the news production,
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 B:  # we # should have discussed this earlier,
0 B:  # but # anyway, it's tough,
0 A:  And you brought up a good point, you know,
0 A:  # Right.  #
0 B:  # tall for a # six year old and, you know, but his,
0 A:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  I was wondering how,
1 B:  # he is # pretty smart, sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed,
1 A:  # Uh-huh [laughter].  #
1 B:  # but [laughter]  # he is smart {very faint}, you know. 
0 A:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #
0 um,
0 B:  Huh-uh.  We just,
0 B:  # so, # no, we don't get,
0 learning but, you know,
0 B:  You know, and then (( )) they had a group of kids and they put on skits and
0 A:  # Huh.  #
0 continuous teacher, somebody to, that he could, uh,
0 B:  # here and this # person can teach me one thing and this person teach,
0 B:  # I # don't allow that when he's at home so, but we had a good experience,
1 B:  # and playing # all day.  And it's important. 
0 A:  # but, # um, you know, just really look into, it will, it will take me a
0 six months old. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # Yeah, and, #
0 A:  Uh-huh.  I think that plays a big part in, in a child's learning and, you
0 know, what they can and cannot do in child care. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  It's, uh, it's a new, uh, form I think, uh, it's like low impact aerobics
1 A:  I probably couldn't do that because of my knee [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh, bad knee [laughter].
0 B:  Um, and, uh, I do toning a lot and, uh, some, every once in a while I play
1 A:  Yeah. 
1 nights a week.
0 you wanted to but, you know, you leave out of there usually the next morning,
0 A:  I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 in one end of the, of the campus and the school, the buildings are all at the
1 and down stairs all day long, so.
1 the lawn mower around that's,
1 able to.
1 A:  We've, we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough
1 B:  Uh-huh.  I don't even own a bike, I think the last time I was on a bike
1 B:  Yeah, but, um, no, I guess that's about the only form, I'm trying to think
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Yeah, and she'd, uh, you know, most of the guys were all in one class so
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah, they're, they're weird.  They're, uh, you ge-, they're just made of,
0 doing, the class is not going to get out, uh, what they should get out of the
1 A:  So, are you going to get into instructing?  Well, what are you studying?
1 B:  No, no, no, no, oh, I could never do that I don't think, [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, the, uh, the, some of the Nautilus equipment that I started seeing at
0 over there,
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 you.
0 B:  And stuff like, a turtle goes faster and, um, it tells it and the whole
1 A:  A little negative reinforcement there while you're going.
1 course.
1 A:  I'm just getting real soft in the middle. 
0 probably put on about ten, nine or ten pounds, since I stopped playing, which
1 A:  But I've, just myself I just notice myself just really, real soft and I'm
1 sure I don't have near the endurance that I did, [laughter].
1 A:  {Very faint}, I just need to, put the old nose to the grindstone, I, I, I
1 A:  All right. 
0 B:  Yeah, one week, [laughter].  Then I plan to get right back into it.  You
1 and I, I mean, I enjoyed, you know, we, when I was playing ball we could like
1 B:  Just ((that)), you know, you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after
1 dinner, [laughter].
1 A:  Oh, I still don't, but [laughter]. 
0 A:  That's a problem. 
0 until I was, um, well into high school.
1 B:  # and # almost all the people that I clean for, believe it or not, are
0 my kids.  But realistically that's, I'm, I'm realizing that's probably not
0 going to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able to live just on
0 B:  You know, it's going to kind of [throat_clearing] kind of go along with the
0 B:  Yeah.  When, when your wife has her baby, is she going to stay home or is
0 B:  Yeah, I, I see a difference in the generation of, even the generation
0 A:  True.  Well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore
0 computers at home,
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 parenting?
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 you first.
0 changing the way it is, uh, it certainly needed, I, the obvious one that
1 turn my radio off here.
0 A:  # I # don't understand why we're, I understand that we support Israel and
0 money into an economy that's obviously mismanaged, for instance. 
1 B:  I'm not sure I understand the, I, I guess there's a, a, a reason for that,
1 B:  Yeah, that there's some kind of justification there and I don't know what
0 they want to impress the, the people that are going to vote for him next
0 month.
0 B:  # Sure.  #
1 which didn't make any sense at all. 
0 A:  Right.  It is amazing how the, the congressmen and senators just start, are
0 totally in another world once,
0 anybody really says. 
1 A:  Right.  Or, ((well, done)) I thought you were going to say what they do. 
0 B:  You know, you just can't go up and, go up there and say, well, we're going
1 A:  Right.  Yeah, exactly. 
0 about what he see, you know,
1 A:  # Exactly.  #
1 uh, uh, do you know how you can tell it when a politician is lying?
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 I guess they're doing logically ((now is the)) defense which is certainly
0 A:  Uh, and they're doing that I think that's, that's,
0 they're doing are the things that are easy.  They're making the easy choices. 
0 never was meant that the politicians would make a career, it was just something
0 B:  # who were, # who, you know, these were the doctors and the lawyers and the
0 B:  # to, # to, to serve proudly and,
0 B:  I wish I had in, in some senses but I don't have time really as much as I
0 A:  # like, # especially like athletes, for some reason it seems to interest
0 bicycling magazines.  They're, I mainly look at the pictures and stuff, but
0 they usually have some good articles in it.
0 A:  But, uh, I don't know I haven't really found any romance type stuff I like
1 A:  Really?
0 B:  That's the, and, and that's like myself I've, I've, I miss it, because I
0 in it and then before you know it, it's time to get up and go to work.  You
1 like that.  Even if I'm, uh, doing something like an afghan, if I'm close to
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Do you know who it was about?
0 B:  It's not up, it's not someone else, you have to do it. 
0 thing.  Just make up their minds that that's it.  You know, have this one
1 B:  Do it.  I can't, I'm not that focused on something. 
1 B:  I, I'm off in all directions. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Yeah, I know. 
1 B:  Oh, jeez. 
0 A:  How do I feel what?
0 A:  Yes.  
0 A:  Yeah, but, so, do you think that people should be required to give a couple
0 compensate me in some way.
0 B:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  
0 B:  That, that, that's true.  But in, even in our region there's an employment
1 A:  And Texas Instruments.
0 are out there looking for jobs.
0 B:  I'm not familiar with that.  
1 A:  though I can't see why it was great.  
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 system, system of highways,
0 A:  and roads, is falling apart.  
0 B:  Well, then I guess there are a lot of, a lot of things that people could do
0 that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that.
0 states, have no real welfare system.
0 who knows, maybe some of our graduating high school seniors would find out a
1 A:  Uh, they wish only for the paycheck.  
0 can, you know, at, at some point, what can you do to sort of raise rev-, I
0 in fact, in some cases that's what we ought to do.
1 A:  Not Reaganomics, thank you. 
0 B:  Huh.  And that way just create more jobs {very faint} or whatever?
0 B:  Yeah, that's what, that's what, yo-, you think space would do that much for
0 technologies.  But I think we should also do something rather radical. 
0 B:  That's probably true. 
1 something new that they could tax. 
0 money.
0 B:  Oh ((real)),
0 it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly, you know, we would be,
0 government,
0 A:  If it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another. 
0 the industry, it comes from senators that don't know anything about it.
0 B:  Oh, okay, so, you know about some of these things. 
0 And I think that we could have less tax by cutting out some of the, the, uh,
0 programs that we support.  But overall I guess we're pretty fortunate natured,
0 where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs
0 aid policies.
1 A:  But I, I think, uh, if we're going to waste money, I'd almost se-, rather
0 think our president can forgive foreign debt, and that's a lot of power vested
1 ((invincibl-,)) invincibility but there's another problem with that I'd, we've
0 B:  The thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were
0 gets elected.  They still kind of run the show and, and setup all the
0 it's, uh, it's our system, I think, now, we have to figure out how to really
0 B:  # some # fine tuning. 
0 people? I have, I have a real problem, federal register, for instance, uh, you
0 A:  so, but, uh, I guess you don't have that problem,
0 B:  and, so, I, I wanted a dog for protection and we-,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  and, uh, that was probably our main reason for getting him.  But,
0  
1 cat just really doesn't care about the dog at all.
0 is one thing.
1 A:  Doesn't, doesn't get too excited about anything?
1 A:  is he?
0 to sit on top of the television set and let their tail, only when, when
1 A:  In front of the screen and, uh, they, they just seem to know, I guess.
0 B:  Uh, not, 
1 A:  Neither did I.   
0 A:  Huh.  
0 rabbit got real large.  I think he was thirteen pounds.
1 A:  Oh, gee, that is a big rabbit.   
1 A:  But, but he's not much protection I would imagine.  
1 B:  No, nothing like that.  
0 A:  #Bye-bye.#  
0 they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through
0 A:  and so all the things come out of the, the property taxes,
0 A:  that the renters were getting including the, uh, educational services.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And the tax payment went to pay for the services that I was getting as a,
0 A:  And, so, uh, you know each county has their own school system an, and it
0 A:  and I don't believe so, um.  A lot of things have come to head recently
0 A:  adjusting it back to, to the days, you know, when it started, uh,
0 B:  No, huh-uh.
0 A:  We've actually gone backwards.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 the-, uh, a lot of emphas-, now is being put on, you know, when children used
0 A:  -- some students do horrible until like eighth grade, some do horrible, you
0 B: Yeah, I think it'd be a lot better.
0 were identi-, identified as being slow.
0 A:  She just has been,
0 A:  yeah, about the seventh, eighth grade I, I, I started to, to come around
1 A:  And it was just a complete culture shock,
1 B:  Yeah that would be quite a shock.
0 A:  Had to learn how to drive a tractor.  
1 A:  Yeah, and it was, you know.  It was like, ki-, kind of like the way we feel
1 about going to work [laughter].
0 they, they seem to really enjoy it.
0 @A:  Okay, uh, let me see, we were supposed to talk about are consumer goods
0 um, a lot of times it's just because it doesn't fit the way that I thought it
1 A:  I haven't either.  I think things must be getting better.
1 B:  We-, I haven't bought that much lately [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, my goodness, that could explain it [laughter].
1 B:  I mean we've had alo-, all ours for quite a while and,
1 A:  Of course, they're probably all Japanese, too.  I'm s-, [laughter].
0 B:  -- by the names, isn't it.
0 A:  And I really would like to buy American but I don't think it's possible, I
0 A:  I do too.
0 B:  Because, I, w-, uh, yesterday I bought a curling iron for my daughter and
0 A:  That's why I prefer, er-, if I'm going to shop at a discount place that's
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, 
1 B:  And if something does, don't you always try to fix it before you ever bring
0 B:  Th-, it's worse, the service is worse.
0 just something wrong with the door originally and th-, I don't think the
0 A:  I have quit Ford and Chevrolet both because the dealers were so lousy
0 A:  if, if the dealer had backed it up, but they didn't.
0 the day so you don't have to always drop it off first thing in the morning,
0 A:  well, you know, I still had to go to the grocery store and to the bank,
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  I said my God, no wonder you guys are suffering up here, the, the prices
0 A:  an, and finally up getting a, a steel, uh,
0 A:  screened in, the carpeting, they insulated,
0 A:  And why, but I have six curling irons up there that have burned up, you
0 vacuum cleaners right now.
0 you know, dead skin off of through the mattress, you know, went from the
1 A:  (( ))I know it. 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 A:  I just, I'm not interested and if they call me on the phone, I'm not
1 B:  You know, I just read about, here's another thing that you can buy
1 [laughter].  
1 A:  Wow, yeah.
0 A:  Oh, naturally, naturally.
1 A:  Yeah, right.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 answering machine, then you have to call everybody back.  If you don't have
1 and she called again and she said well, didn't you get my message on the

0 @A:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  What?
0 uh, child care. 
0 A:  Uh, do you get penalized for taking it off?
1 A:  Huh-uh. 
1 A:  # it's # really not a very good benefit. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 ((without)), you know, I just can't ((you know)) there's something going on

1 B:  You know, staying home with the kids but that's still, you know, kids are

0 A:  Yeah, and, so, we've shut down six weeks a year whereas we used to only
0 mean,
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 mean, it's like,
0 expensive and, you know, I don't, I don't like it.  Do you have, uh, um, four O
1 A:  Yeah, like,
1 A:  Harris Semiconductors in Florida. 
0 B:  At all?
1 B:  Gosh, that's pretty bad. 
0 A:  {Very faint} Huh. 
1 I would have qualified.
1 A:  Uh, and they have become, or, also a, a real bother sometimes.
1 stuff and it adds up.
1 little as possible, uh,
1 look at ((counting)) credit cards?
1 people think they need to get paid.
1 getting paid because they're, know if you don't,
1 A:  you ei-, you either pay the thing off or they come get it.  
1 A:  And it's turned into personnel and they come get you [throat_clearing].
0 B:  Oh, #yeah.#  
0 A:  #some# of the others do.  
0 A:  But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month,
1 A:  so, you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that,
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  but, it, you know, you kind of, you know that somebody every month, and
1 A:  and most of the time it is.  
0 B:  A girlfriend of mine found a, it was a Visa or MasterCard, she found an ad
1 A:  Oh, that's not bad.  
1 A:  as far as I can tell.  I mean, they've been,
0 there with cards, they're going to get cards at ((the)),
1 A:  {Very faint} Yeah.
0 have time to fool with it or, [breathing] you know, it's just out of my
0 B:  Yeah.  Do you have like an American or foreign car?
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 and, um, that's about it these days. 
0 A:  Yeah, metric,
0 A:  [Breathing]  How much did that cost you to have that fixed?
0 A:  Yeah [breathing].  It's not cheap like it used to be. 
0 A:  I've had, uh, we have a Volvo, and, uh, I had some steering problems, and
0 it ended up being the entire rack and pinion steering assembly.
1 B:  Wow [breathing]. 
0 anybody having that happen to them. 
0 to cover it, but they just refused to do it. 
0 for just regular warranty work and things like that, it's, it's been a real
1 [\noise]  thousand, and mine's an eighty-eight and it's, it just turned over
0 nightmare for them. 
0 American trucks, but with cars I, I've not had much luck with, uh, American
0 A:  # spending on # foreign and as opposed to, to American, I spent far less on
0 A:  Long-term, a lot, a lot more.  And then, then you add the, the fuel savings
0 A:  # you # know, like the, the Lexus. 
0 scaling down [breathing] and they can't improve the gas mileage anymore
0 B:  And I don-, I don't think people mind too much taking the car in for a
0 major problems that they'll have to pay for on top of that. 
1 A:  That's right.  And with American cars and the warranties you don't know. 
0 A:  # [Breathing] I don't know.  That's # su-, surprising because, [breathing]
0 A:  So, I'll buy Ford trucks, but I'll buy foreign cars. 
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 have so many different interests and so many different things we have to do,
0 anything like some of the big cities do.
0 B:  Well, I've found the easiest way is, uh, is to ride bikes, in Raleigh,
0 B:  It's about two hundred and fifty thousand. 
1 A:  See, that's, that isn't even, I mean, I'm not sure that a pers-, even a
0 A:  [Breathing] Um, [breathing] another thing that, that I think our, my
1 A:  it's really bad.  
0 immediately do something about it --
0 B:  Right.
0 they care a little bit more, and I think as adults we need to care, because
0 A:  the future for our kids, and I, [breathing] you know, I mean, my kids are
1 A:  it's definitely, has to be that,
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 nonrecyclables to a special place, and then people would,
1 A:  That's true.  
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Do you?  
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Yes, that's right.
0 B:  it, they lose a lot, and it takes a lot of energy to do it. 
1 [breathing] especially if you have children, and [breathing] because, you
0 to be a completely different world,
0 A:  so, [breathing] you know, like I, I know that I need to car pool, and I
1 [lipsmack] you could easily say, Well, we should go back to living in caves
1 [laughter],
0 slowly enough people adjust to it.
1 A:  Right, right.
0 A:  #Well, you know, just,# yeah, just with, with our thing in Plano, it had,
1 the problem, than it is.
1 A:  it's there, and we've got to face it [breathing].
0 A:  And I see, I wonder, I wonder how much the laws [breathing] that Congress
1 B:  Right.
0 B:  Um, I,
1 A:  and now it's a mess.
1 B:  I've never known it to be one [laughter].  I guess [breathing] I'm a
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  That's true. Uh-huh.
0 A:  I think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that
0 A:  and I'm thinking that community service would help them, uh, just get a
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  unless they actually see it and, you know, help or something.
0 B:  uh, extraordinary things on T V,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  There's something I, I've really be skeptical of, you know, you watch
0 B:  I know and how do yo-,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  If you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know?
0 A:  doors open, you just run,
0 A:  you know, and this was only, uh, well I guess it has been awhile, it's
0 B:  #In Dallas I,# 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 afraid.  
0 A:  Wow.
0 B:  you know, a foreigner there that,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I mean at one time they would go into the service,
0 B:  but nowadays, they don't do that anymore.
0 B:  Or to, uh, you know, do something for someone else.
0 you know, would stay home and having that mother there, that base, I think,
0 A:  was a big part of, of family, a big part of, of what, you know, your,
0 B:  so to speak.  Okay?  It, it's what's important to you.
0 B:  Now a family, I, I think that like girls today, have children,
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 a couple this year.  I want to see Nolan pitch one time,

0 loaded, you know, one mistake cause a lot of these players aren't used to
0 until, uh, he got mad at Pete Incaviglia and just cut him for, because he was
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Well I'm definitely looking forward to going to a few games this
0 he's got a problem in his personal life, I just, you know, he, he messed up
0 B:  Yeah, it's, uh, it's just too bad, it's, you know, like the players that do
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # and, uh, # like they have a thing called Mom and Me,
0 you know, stayed there over night.  We couldn't do anything, so as soon as we
0 B:  # But # I think he and I were the only ones that stayed high and dry so to
1 speak,
0 know, pup tent type,
0 A:  # but # good experience for us to know that we definitely didn-, needed to
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 several years since I've been camping,
0 A:  See that's, that's very nice.  The only thing I think about camping is when
0 thing.  They cooked some kind of, uh, of an Indian pastry type thing on a, in

0 so. 
1 B:  Yeah, but, uh,

1 their pets.
1 they work at it a little bit, and even more when they work at it a little bit
0 B:  D-, okay.
0 A:  Yeah, and, uh, he used to, I used to come down stairs in the morning to
0 feed him, you know, and I'd let him up out of the basement where he was
1 sleeping and he would just dance around the floor and I just got,
1 B:  Okay.
0 B:   Oh, uh, by choice?
0 A:  about two years, two and a half years I guess.  It was about, uh, oh,
1 three feet long, about three feet long.
1 A:  #Clyde the iguana.#  
1 home and I looked at him and I said you've got to be kidding, 
1 B:  Yuck!  [Laughter].
0 A:  No,
1 B:  Oh no, oh no.
1 we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and
1 B:  Oh no, I mean you don't argue with an iguana, do you.
0 A:  [Laughter]  But he was really a neat animal.  He, he'd lay in Dan's lap,
1 head, you know, with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off,
0 He'd even tolerate him petting though, he didn't like them too well at first,
0 was a drummer,
1 A:  When Dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up, you know like he was
1 A:  protect himself, {still laughing} and then he'd leave the room
0 B:  Oh.
0 the run out there, and he didn't like this run because there were no people
1 house and, and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air [laughter].
1 little peas as fast as they came up, you know.
1 B:  I bet [laughter].
0 B:  Well can we ask you whatever happened to Clyde?
1 be sure you left the doors open, you know, he didn't like to go anywhere else,
0 door, if you happened to close it on him or something, you know, but,
1  A:  Well, what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you
0 A:  A little bit easier to have cats in this kind of country, though isn't it,
1 seal point, she's the little girl and then, uh, n-, Newhart is the, uh, the,
1 wants his belly scratched and that's it, you know.
1 A:  Is it?
1 B:  # that's good.  #
0 A:  I usually stick, mainly with something I can put on the grill.  Usually
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  Yeah, or just, you can just, you, you can use your imagination on that kind
1 B:  # That's neat.  #
0 usually everybody, you know, that, usually everybody likes that, ((some of))
1 whatever. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 to cook though? Your best simple one. 
1 B:  The one you put on top the burners, ((beat)) out with the hammer.  It's
0 B:  Right.  Does your wife do her own Oriental cooking though?
1 A:  No, I do that too. 
1 A:  Uh, she, she likes it so-so. 
0 A:  I, uh, she usually tells me what she likes and, uh, she's taught me how to
0 A:  # Uh, #
0 B:  Well, just about anything can go in the middle. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Brush it or,
0 B:  Brush the egg white on there?
0 B:  [Baby_talking]. 
0 A:  Do what now?
0 A:  Oh, really? My daughter loves that stuff. 
0 B:  # ((I like)), #
0 stuff I just toss one of those in there. 
0 A:  what brand they are.  They're, uh,
1 B:  I know I love deer steaks. 
0 the same thing. 
0 A:  Well, I use, see I use my outside grill probably three nights a week. 
1 B:  In Kentucky we use them maybe once or twice a month.  Now if that
0 [laughter]. 
0 A:  I used to not use it so much but when I got my gas grill, I used it a lot. 
0 B:  Oh, I just like the taste of stuff cooked out on a charcoal grill though. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 college student.
1 B:  I consider a full-time college student, I don't consider it really a job
1 but I guess in a way it would be [laughter].
0 do plan probably to work when you receive your degree.
1 B:  Yes. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 badly were horrible on me, and so when I got this color test done for clothing,
1 A:  So, I got rid of all those.  I mean I hated to get rid of those. 
1 A:  Suits that, pantsuits that were a hundred and fif-,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 think that's relates to the same thing as the winter. 
0 greens. 
0 pieces of clothing will do you probably for several years. 
1 B:  Oh, yeah, I already started buying suits and I've already, you know, I've
1 A:  Well, that's, that's very smart.  Well, I, i-, have we exhausted our
1 subject? [laughter]. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  # quite # so well and it says that suntan really doesn't go with everything
1 really an off-white and it's, I don't think it's a real white, white either,
0 A:  Well, anyway I thought that i-, it was the first time I had ever read an
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  But it said also they find that navy shirt and navy stockings and navy
1 B:  [Laughter]  Oh, gosh. 
1 a message if you know any guys that want to do this.
1 our union seceded.
1 there's going to be anything left, uh, given that anything like that happens. 
0 B:  Uh, given that anything like that happens. 
0 B:  I guess I'm co-, why is, why is communism antithetical to democracy.  I can
0 A:  That's right. 
1 recently in the hospital and so for a moment Dan Quayle might have been,
0 A:  That's right.
1 A:  and when you do it's usually totally,
1 B:  It's a joke [laughter]. 
0 B:  I just I can't see them maintaining the missile bases, in fact I think if
0 B:  the first thing they're going to do is close down the missile bases in
0 hands. 
0 theirs. 
0 wasn't, their not doing it just because they want to.
0 A:  the teachers, you know.  We-, how do you feel about that?
0 A:  Oh, oh yeah, I'm in Dallas, Texas. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 golly, it sure going to make a big difference in our school system
0 A:  Yeah, it is.  
0 saying they are number one, they are adding, next year they are adding thirty
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  voluntary and plus you buy a lot of extra arts, crafts aids, things like
0 A:  little bug things, you know that [sniffing].
0 it, enough to serve, you know, fifteen people.  
0 A:  Oh my gosh.
0 and even so, figuring it up, I think she spent close to twenty dollars.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  you know, touted, but, I think overall, 
0 A:  Basketball.
0 B:  you can't do that in this school system, so.  
1 B:  Well yeah, this is, uh, this is interesting, interesting topic.
0 A:  # we put # in a new dash, it's been recarpeted, it's just, it was, you
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  And, uh, I, uh, I guess the interesting about this is about the only work I
0 B:  And I was able to do a brake job on there at fairly, I think expensive
0 B:  But another interesting aspect of this car, like yours is, uh, it's only
1 B:  Because I only change the oil every twenty-five thousand miles. 
0 B:  I do change the oil filters every twelve thousand five hundred, though. 
1 B:  # I # just wrote Mobil Oil Corporation a letter as a matter of fact,
0 miles,
0 overhauled but all the, uh, fluid drained out and new screen and, and filters
0 A:  # Wow.  #
1 been put in the car. 
0 B:  And, uh, uh, one, uh, uh, um, voltage regulator during all this time. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # and # I proceeded from then on to never change the oil but every
0 A:  And I had that car only, uh, about two years and the engine blew in it. 
0 B:  # Uh.  #
0 B:  I guess that's, uh, uh, y-, you must undoubtedly get all kinds of
0 depending on how they got made,
0 B:  # but this # one here has just lasted and lasted and lasted. 
1 B:  # Oh really.  #
1 at you about something. 
0 B:  Because I had a van that, uh, somebody sugared my gas tank and it, it tore
0 B:  It, uh, freezes up the rings and everything inside so they can't lubricate
0 from bottom out,
0 don't know if it was just a lemon, even though it was a brand new engine,
0 A:  Yeah, course it was a brand new engine, supposedly.  Now that's what the
0 We took, we took after pictures, it's a shame that we didn't take before
0 B:  Okay, um, I don't know, are you in your thirties, or,
1 B:  # Well # then I can tell you that roles have changed.  I'm thirty-eight
0 [laughter], 
0 not assertive and independent. 
0 A:  # Exactly.  #
1 B:  Um, I'm trying to think of what else.  I have a lot of opinions on this
1 B:  # but in # terms of women,
1 A:  # [Laughter]  Yeah.  #
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # He was ancient, yeah.  #
1 A:  I went, what. 
0 B:  # I was # twenty-seven when I got married and I just at the time, um, my
0 A:  # And # that, that has to do with, you know, the women getting out and
1 A:  # She's, she's about forty.  #
1 just turned thirty-eight. 
1 A:  # [Laughter].  #
0 up. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 my background is in journalism and corporate communications,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # Oh it is.  #
1 A:  # You # know, and so I feel like I'm old.  It's like I sing,
0 B:  # if # you know you haven't been able to children, which we do know,
0 A:  # Right.  #
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 B:  # we # couldn't do that then.  And my cousins and I go, well why couldn't
1 B:  Here's what you shoul-, d-, this is off the topic, and those people
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 so that's why I got the gift. 
0 Holmes and then somebody turned me on to a guy named Dick Frances, um, and
0 A:  Yeah adventure, yeah, uh, some of that gets, I don't know, I think they've
0 B:  Yeah, I mean, I just got the feeling that he sort of has a (( )) of, of
1 A:  # [Laughter].  #
0 cuts and no, he, he explains that when he did it the first time because of
0 for DUNE.  I read through it all, it was laborious, I, I,
0 didn't, en-, didn't enjoy it that much. 
0 B:  I think his stuff is, is great, just going back to his very early works and
0 read the whole thing out loud.
0 B:  And, uh, [laughter]. 
0 A:  Huh. 
0 A:  Yeah, have, have you ever heard of the SOURCE BOOK PROJECT. 
0 B:  Oh, no, no. 
0 B:  # Wean.  #
0 to do by yourself.  So we ended up with a contractor and went through that
1 B:  Isn't that amazing. 
0 B:  # Yeah [laughter].  #
0 upstairs, in the attic, it, uh, had a little leak and leaked down in, uh, under
0 B:  All those little details that you, you don't really understand, you know,
0 A:  It's hard, it's hard to make it fit perfectly,
0 B:  it's, it's a chore and a half, without tearing the whole thing out and
0 A:  # So # it was easy to disguise that, but, uh, it was in an area where you
0 gave us a lot of clues.  You just wish you knew all this stuff going in that,
0 A:  # Yeah, they, #
0 I've had prior experience in design and building and stuff like that,
0 B:  # Oh neat.  #
1 me. 
0 B:  Yeah, those and so they're not going to split and, and I was really
1 B:  Yeah, that's, that's the end part that's where you, you know, get the, uh,
0 A:  # The one thing # you might do, if he will deliver the boards that he is
1 that in there and turn them over several times and let them set and soak in. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  # you # don't even have to do that. 
0 A:  # I've seen # decks that are ten years old that, uh, that still have never
0 A:  # And, # uh, or they even have some rejuvenator that you can put on there
0 cases if you do it properly it will not even be required. 
0 A:  # even # if you got it on the side of some of your bricks, or, or on your
1 B:  Well that's definitely interesting because here we go with another home
1 can learn a lot by doing that.
0 They're great big green things.  They ru-, on rollers.  They're not hard at all
0 B:  Not yet,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  And use them as mulch in the garden or around the yard, so you
0 B:  Uh, paper can go now.  We bundle that on top of our [noise] and set it out
1 B:  Well,
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Do you?
0 the paper recycling, you know, the newspaper,
0 A:  # Right.  #
0 A:  Real environmentally,
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  # but # I did with my last two. 
0 A:  # five # kids?
0 B:  yeah, I have five.  And, uh, well, [noise]  the actually now I think about
1 A:  # Because they stay forever.  #
1 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 B:  You're using it, uh, more where as when you buy the others they used it
1 you know,
1 know, if my kids have got a cold, you know, I put them in bed with cloth
1 A:  And they are the best dusters [laughter]. 
0 been married seventeen years,
0 A:  well, they've really started, you know, I wish they would do that, um,
0 B:  # We-, #
1 B:  Well, if you ever get to come here you must put on your list of place to go
1 one with a baby sitter and one with, uh, a child care service and, uh, what she
1 [laughter]  has done is to actually, uh, find a way of working at home so she
1 does not have to be a away from her children [laughter], 
0 A:  Oh, my gosh. 
1 weren't very attentive to the children, uh, each child is an individual and,
1 time.  It just wasn't working out very well,
0 here in Maryland, uh, we have had a couple of incidences that, uh, where child
1 knew to care for her child and this was fine as long as the person was willing
1 to do it, but then she decided that she was [laughter] going to go work
1 B:  that's right.  That's right.  And that's what, she's almost working for
1 [breathing]  you realize the child care if it's done right is probably
1 B:  Right.  Oh, yes. 
1 about six months with their two, two little girls and, uh, she look in children
1 B:  # Right.  #
0 Of course, it was only for, uh, like four hours,
0 B:  -- so, she was three of them off and on for, uh, more than twenty-four
0 B:  So, uh, but, uh, uh, but it is hard and, and if you move into a new area --
1 A:  # and, uh, #
0 B:  save 'em money all-around [laughter]. 
0 B:  # You # know, to put somebody in a nursing home.  I, if, I suppose if you
1 B:  I've not ever been put in this position.  I personally would have a real
0 hard time taking care of my father [laughter].  He's getting up there, but he's
0 rough choice to make.  Depending on the parent and their personality and, you
0 B:  # that # respected, uh, that you seem to see some respect for peoples
0 older man.  That was a head injury unit and he had apparently wet his pants
1 the floor or he had dropped it on the floor and the nurse was just screaming
0 thought, gosh, if I walked into a place and I saw a staff member just berating
0 state of mental, you know, confusion, anyway to have constant new people on
0 B:  # Oh, # I don't know what else, other than, that maybe some place that had
1 activities, you know, that they could participate in instead of just kind of
0 B:  But, you know, the cost of it is probably just horrendous. 
0 B:  Yeah.  I think that would be great.  I had wished often with my husband's
0 climb up and down the stairs, haul groceries and then she would have people to
0 check on her and didn't have to cook, because she just got to a point where
1 have dorms for older people, so they had activities going on all the time and,
0 home and, you know, a retirement village or whatever they're called. 
1 B:  Instead of just being kind of taken away from all of that and being told
1 B:  It is.  I've, I've had a lot of thought, thought provoking conversations on
1 preventative health care, I think that will help.  It just seems very slow
1 A:  # something like # that.  Well, it's been fun talking with you. 
0 B:  [Laughter]  Okay, well take care. 
0 A:  I do have friends that have children, yes. 
0 B:  Well, that's true,
0 B:  Much as other cultures disagree, our lives don't revolve around our
1 and when I've had friends that have said, when you hear people say, it, it
1 B:  # that # most of the time, it's worth it. 
0 B:  Well, I just have to be honest about it.  It's not always,
1 other and she got older and she said, but you know, we never do those things
1 A:  Huh-uh.  I think it takes a, I don't know, I think your patient level must,
1 B:  Yeah, I have a nine year old that I would trade happily for a baby (( )).
1 B:  It has to be somewhere else and no it's not adequate to sit and wait. 
1 B:  Of course. 
1 many years. 
1 B:  (( )) because I didn't need it. 
1 A:  Now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly, I'm sure. 
1 B:  Yeah.  And it stays low a lot [laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Of course. 
0 don't have kids and I'm an only child so I've never been around children.  So,
1 friends. 
0 taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to
1 B:  # Have enough.  #
1 A:  # have a # whole bunch [laughter]. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  And then you don't really know what happened. 
1 but, uh,
0 B:  Well, it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted but that may
0 A:  So,
0 B:  I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved --
0 B:  -- but that's more a matter of, you know --
0 B:  -- and sooner or later there's going to, there's going to be a turn around.
0 @@A:  Yeah, that's right.  Do you work at T I?
0 A:  So.  How long you been with them, since you moved down here?
0 B:  Yeah, so am I. 
0 B:  Well,
1 B:  Are you D A D or something?
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].  Yep, you must know him.  His reputation precedes him. 
0 A:  Lubbock is, I don't know, I guess if this is the only place you've lived,
0 DeVry.  Is there a DeVry in Akron?
0 area, and, uh, he works over in the Park, Park Central building I think but,
0 B:  No, I haven't been back in fi-, ten, fifteen years. 
1 A:  You still have relatives back there or,
1 B:  I don't know, I think we ran out of social,
0 B:  Maybe.  There are some jobs where I guess it doesn't really,
0 B:  If, if it's a position where it could potentially affect,
0 A:  That's true I didn't think about that, like for instance,
0 big deal, I think, you know,
0 months, some stay for less, some stay for longer. 
0 B:  Things like L S D, I guess, stay forever. 
0 don't use drugs, I have no problem with taking a test. 
0 B:  # that's a fine line to draw.  #
0 rather have it private,
1 you like your mother? You know? I said, yes. 
0 B:  Those are just to get, probably to get some sort of, those are to get the
0 B:  What they're trying to do there is, they want to sort of get a base line
1 B:  # Maybe # (( )). It can be shocking and,
1 A:  But I guess, I don't know, some people have probably killed their mothers. 
1 I don't know [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah, well, I guess so, I mean, I guess, I don't know how, what
1 actually happens if, uh, if you have killed your mother [laughter]. 
1 B:  # stuff # like that.  So,
0 B:  Yeah, and I don't think that you killed your mother though, I wouldn't
0 B:  Yeah.  That's, uh, you know, it, it could blow things right away for them,
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  Yeah.  The other day we had talked about, uh, capital punishment. 
1 because I hear about it, but I hadn't had to sit down and, and well, what do I
0 A:  Okay.  It was very nice talking to you. 
0 B:  Okay, it worked out fine. 
1 B:  That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great
1 A:  # That's okay.  #
1 B:  # but my, # um, softball unit here [laughter] is acting like he's dying of
1 ((tramane)) poison [laughter]. 
0 B:  which I'm not Italian, no, it's , it's all the garlic bread and all the,
1 A:  # [Laughter]  Yeah.  #
0 B:  # like # at Gatti's or something like that. 
0 B:  # spices # or sauces they use. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah. 
0 notice is it's just, um, about dining out that you probably can relate to with
0 B:  I mean lunch today was eighteen dollars. 
1 B:  I'm glad I'm talking about food normally these conversations are
0 B:  Yeah, I love seafood,
1 A:  # Oh.  #
1 B:  # or # American or piano bar, and I remember when we went [laughter], 
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  It made all raw fish tastes great [laughter]. 
1 A:  Um. 
1 B:  [Laughter].

1 A:  # they're # they're kind of, my littlest girl she's still like wants
0 A:  Well, it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different
1 B:  # Uh-huh, I know where that, #
0 A:  # that's on the nights we can't decide.  #
0 A:  Oh, how nice. 
1 food so I can say this, but they, you have to bring a formula, and I said
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 just too much of a distraction and some restaurants are really trying to go for
1 B:  And that always just bothered me and then, um, on the other hand sometimes
1 the children or the adults are themselves [laughter]. 
0 B:  I can't remember the name of it it's on, uh,
1 was just terrible. 
1 B:  like when you're in a bad part of Italy or something. 
0 A:  Oh. 
1 A:  # Oh.  #
1 B:  No, except that this makes me fat.  No, I'm just kidding. 
1 B:  Yeah, that's true, but you can always blame it on having children, no

0 mainframe computer.
0 kit and build a computer it like have a, would have a manual step-by-step
0 A:  [Cough].  
0 A:  Oh.
0 stuff he's, he knows about Heath Kit probably.
0 I built it myself, when I got to a certain point I took it to a T I engineer.
0 in your home that has the same stuff in it that your office does.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  Well, you can have them connected by a, by a ((modem)) if you want to,
0 B:  take your data files from one to the other,
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  ((a)) different computers for the same, 
0 B:  Yeah, so, but, uh, you know it's, uh, you know, the computer it's, uh, the,
0 where, um, accounting classing in college have to have computer for the
0 B:  outside the accounting area.  
1 know, all of my accounting work and, of course, I write letters on the
1 lot.
0 A:  use a computer.  
0 A:  So, now, I'm for, my little boy's birthday is coming up and I was thinking
0 more or less.
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 having to go back to school just too keep up with him.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  you, you suddenly discover that your educated when the students are
1 [laughter].
0 B:  well it's been it's been interesting taking about computers it's, uh,
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  And, uh, I guess maybe they'll ring us up again sometime [laughter].
0 into the house, into the car, into the utiliti-, anything that's to do with the
0 you know, if som-, something in the h-, well the house one gets the money for
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 start to pull money from something and put it into another, into another
0 because I'm pretty strict, I don't usually take money from anywhere,
0 A:  # and, # you know, ours, ours is pretty simple, but, uh, but w-, I do have,
0 privately,
0 B:  # each # of our children have a savings account.  And then there's a basic
0 We just try to put that right away in savings.  It's very difficult sometimes
1 to, to not think and say, well God, we have a little bit in savings, let's
0 A:  Yeah we, we have a, we have one savings account that we have jointly,
0 got it set up to where it takes both of us to sign it --
0 know,
0 A:  # [Throat_clearing]  [Talking]  {voices in background}. #
0 A:  # That's, goes # directly for, for her.  And then we also have a savings
0 least build her education fund [/talking].
0 don't think it's going to be there.
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # you know, a lot # of money going out, uh, than what we can pay for, but I
1 until, um, I just had a baby seven months ago and she had extensive problems
0 uh, she was in the hospital for like a month and the money that accumulated in
0 A:  Yeah, I keep pretty extensive records on, on, you know, what I do and I
0 I write every check down for the amount of money, or whoever takes money out
0 of the A T M, I write down that amount of money.  And as it comes through, uh,
0 their format so that they can put it on to their computer and,
0 for most of these invasions of privacy as people call them, so. 
0 A:  # Just # screen a hundred percent of your calls and you don't have that,
0 A:  That's the way to do it, yeah. 
0 always open to the public, yea-, you can't always get out and find every
0 everybody to know, but, uh, it's going across, uh, computer lines and people
0 invasion of privacy.  Not so much the fact that the data is there but the way
1 B:  # Right.  #
1 B:  And I'm trying to figure out how, how to feed him so he'll eat this stuff
1 A:  Right, that's true. 
0 serve them on a half shell with a little bit of, uh, stuffing.  What we like
0 A:  And then cut up fresh peppers and fresh tomatoes and fresh celery and bread
0 yams and some either red potato or either white potato, and I put them in a
0 A:  And I slice them, I peel the yam, slice that.  I slice the white potato
0 B:  # Uh.  #
1 those Fren-, fancy french sauces.
1 A:  Oh [laughter]. 
1 take the kids for an hour.  And it really only takes about fifteen or twenty
0 expensive but I, and I like the leaner cut of pork. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 together. 
0 B:  Just lemon pepper. 
1 people kind of go (( )), you know, this is a low fat recipe,
0 A:  Okay. 
1 A:  # Two.  #
0 B:  The other thing that, that I've really got into down here in Texas is
1 B:  Oh, I don't know we also have, you know, foot long roaches all,
1 B:  # year # long too. 
1 A:  Yeah [laughter]. 
0 One of them went over to,
1 B:  # Oh.  #
0 B:  Oh, I cannot believe, uh, what they're doing, uh, academically the demands
0 A:  # at # sometimes.  Um, I don't know though it's, it's kind of hard to
1 A:  # Did you? #
0 uh, of good directions turning,
0 increasingly sophisticated labor force and,
0 A:  Uh, yeah, just the volume makes a big difference,
0 B:  # Yes.  #
0 not so much, uh, it's not so much the kids, it's just the volume of it,
0 home when they're home.  Um,
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  # uh, # uh, I find working in a high school is very helpful because it
1 B:  # and # it keeps me from being the old ((fogy)) so, but at the same time,
1 B:  # it # also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes,
0 A:  # Yes, I think [laughter]  that's true.  #
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  Well I think probably that we've just about [laughter]. 
0 B:  # talking with you.  #
0 @A:  Oh, really, what are you making?
0 gravy and making corn and wheat (( )) stuff that you can buy at a store, which
0 B:  # so # this isn't for her, this is for our friends that came over and
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Yeah, we, we, consistently, if we cook, if, if we have a dinner party we
1 A:  Yeah, that's something that's, you know, really easy.  In fact I'm having a
0 dinner [laughter]  party next Saturday and that is what I'm having is pasta. 
0 A:  Well for,
0 homemade noodles so, um,
0 B:  Electric or, uh,
0 A:  No it's the hand kind,
1 B:  # Best, #
0 B:  Uh-huh,
0 B:  I,
1 A:  A lot of people think though that I've talked to about it think that it's,
0 B:  And then, um, and with that it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta. 
0 B:  By throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up
0 B:  # I # made, (( )) I making yucky (( )).
1 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 A:  Um, well, I don't entertain that often, uh, when I do though I, I have some
1 friends that I always [laughter]  like to experiment on. 
1 A:  So I'll say, okay, you guys are experimental I want say how this is going
0 B:  That's great. 
1 B:  # Uh.  #
1 A:  # in # fact she passed it on to her parent and [laughter], 
0 B:  Yeah, that's ((how these things sort)) of make it for one person as an
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 kind of throw them in and, you know, I don't to the point of, you know,
1 B:  That means you're a real cook. 
1 [laughter]  ((or something)).
0 B:  It's real good. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  I think it's God's gift to cooking. 
0 B:  We li-, live in our wok. 
1 B:  So anything else you cook [laughter]. 
0 B:  Well, that's good, that's always the way to do it.  I think ((it's, uh,)).
1 A:  It is, it's, it's neat but it takes a long time, you know, I mean like I'm
0 cakes and then I guess just because I don't have the expertise to just hurry up
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # so, # you know, he cooks a lot but,
1 B:  # could # do anything with cakes so. 
1 and it's,
0 A:  # You know, some different hints. #
0 B:  Well, that helps. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah. 
1 good sugar. 
1 B:  Yes, well, have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week. 
1 B:  Huh.  That seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before.
1 A:  #And, and I'm [clicking] sure they're# colored by what I've edited.
1 A:  -- to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been
1 at it a long time [laughter] but have been making the same mistakes for a long
0 involved.  Pay attention to what's happening.  Talk to the teachers.  Uh, talk
1 B:  Uh-huh.  That's, uh, some pretty good ideas.  Why don't you do something
1 with those #[laughter]?#
0 board for eight years.
1 than some people, #less than others [laughter].#
0 accordingly.  If we paid them more, it would attract more the, the higher
0 B:  [breathing].
1 B:  And, you know, the whole electronic #classroom idea.#
0 A:  #[laughter].#
1 B:  We-, we-, STAR SEARCH, it wasn't.  
0 A:  I mean STAR SEARCH, STAR TREK [laughter].   
0 B:  Uh, well, it's, it's, it's, it's better put together bet-, better dialogues
1 B:  Hey, try it out.   
0 B:  Then, then the following night you can watch MARRIED WITH CHILDREN.
1 A:  Yeah, yeah, I like that.   
0 A:  Uh, when I watch T V, I like to kind of getaway kind of laugh and that's,
0 B:  That's a good show.   
1 A:  No, huh-uh.   
1 B:  To, to [laughter], to go back that far [laughter]. 
0 B:  And it's, it's, it-, it's amazingly accurate.   
1 B:  Oh, yeah, yeah it, it, it really is.   
0 B:  the Army was the only one that accepted towards the end.   
0 WORLD, CHEERS, I really like CHEERS.
0 A:  Yeah, I'm kind of getting burned out,  
1 A:  In fact I went to a last episode of DALLAS party at a friend's house.
1 B:  [Laughter] Oh.   
1 A:  was.  I was pretty disappointed in the ending.   
0 B:  I guess that's the way to go.   
0 B:  I don't watch a lot of network stuff.  
1 A:  Yeah.  I find myself watching a lot of C N N.  I like, they have a fashion
0 B:  is that the world finds out,  
0 A:  Right.   
0 A:  And the, the networks themselves where depending on C N N.  
0 A:  Right, exactly.   
0 B:  And I, I, you know, it, it was an idea whose time to come and Turner's kind
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, we're, we're up there [laughter].  
0 A:  We're trying to become, 
1 A:  But, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm not in Waco by choice, I just I have to work here,
1 B:  #I'm sure no one is.#   
1 A:  [Laughter] Really.   
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 A:  which is not, not far away.   
0 B:  Well, I hailed from Arizona State.   
1 A:  Oh. 
1 B:  You must, you must. 
1 A:  I, I haven't got, oh. 
1 B:  Yeah, well, listen dear I guess we've stayed from the T V thing.
1 A:  Yeah, I've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television
1 B:  Okay. 
1 A:  Yeah what do you like?
1 B:  Well [laughter], 
1 far,
1 A:  Yeah, but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize, um, gee
1 phonic,
1 A:  Well, I don't know T V shows, what can I tell you, um, basically junk
1 you ever seen MURPHY BROWN, or anything like that?
0 B:  Well, see another thing was I worked on second shift for like a year and a
1 A:  Right, nobody does yeah, then, uh-huh. 
1 that old, but I'm going, jeez, I can't believe that thing's still on television
0 television so far?
1 B:  Well, about, almost a year. 
0 A:  Oh my God [laughter]. 
1 A:  Yeah, you've got about another six months and then you'll get one
1 [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, my husband is an only child too and he did miss it that's kind of why
1 we got back after eighteen months,
1 B:  # [Laughter]  That's funny.  #
1 A:  Yeah,
0 B:  # [Laughter].  #
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Yeah, I've heard it's pretty cool. 
0 B:  And then, uh, I like watching a lot of like college basketball and,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 that good this year.  Um, we're supposed to talk about television let's see
0 A:  # I'm # originally from Pennsylvania, so. 
1 B:  I was going to say. 
0 B:  Cause I wondered if you really, you know, if had any teams you like
1 B:  Yeah, so I like the Bears. 
0 A:  # I like tennis so # I mean I'm not, I haven't played in years but, um, I
1 B:  I wa-, used to watch OPRAH a lot in the afternoons,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  I know I guess with that money who cares [laughter]. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Really. 
0 B:  Yeah, we got,
1 A:  really, that's television I don't know in general on this project we're
1 A:  That's okay,
0 B:  # I # feel bad cause I mean,
1 A:  # and # why you would advise them.  And she was from Boston, and she, I
1 everybody's,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  # what # was his name, uh,
1 B:  # [Laughter].  #
0 A:  Yeah, he's funny. 
0 )) and some of those people they really have funny characters on there. 
1 don't know if it's a man or a woman [laughter]. 
1 A:  # so # to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse and Pat
1 says no I carry a fanny pack [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  Yeah it's weird [laughter]. 
1 B:  Like when WAYNE'S WORLD, I love that. 
1 A:  Yeah, WAYNE'S WORLD, hey man [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Well, I don't know, I've seen it off and on, I think. 
1 B:  Uh?
1 sold his. 
0 start, um, you know, I mean you just kind of all of sudden cause you're going
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 you know,
1 B:  # [Laughter].  #
1 A:  # you're # doing other things [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  Is that on tape?
0 B:  Oh, wow, that's scary. 
0 A:  It is, um, at Purdue I'm trying to think, I went to high school in Chicago,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  That's the girls I lived with and, you know, other then that I'm sure they
1 A:  # like # entertainment tonight I've never seen M T V?
0 don't think it's worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay,
1 B:  # No.  #
1 A:  # somebody, # uh, to, you know, give me a hundred and fifty, um [laughter],
0 little since Reagan and them decided to cut it.  Uh, I used to get these, uh,
0 spending and cut it was to cut taxes forcing spending to have to be cut, but,
0 B:  # And, # uh, cut their spending and if they had, uh, done that without
0 cutting taxes we wouldn't find ourselves in the economic quagmire we're in
0 A:  # depending on # how much you earn. 
0 B:  # Well.  #
0 B:  Yeah, well that's where the rich, see, uh,
0 B:  Right, uh, in what way, what loopholes then are, are left that you're
1 change it to encourage saving. 
0 A:  Um, well, tha-, [laughter]  that's a good question. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  # has # not encouraged activity in the market yet.  I think people are
0 spending again.  Right now,
0 taxes, they can't afford to borrow anymore, or they won't just because they
0 uh, federal debt, but consumer debt too, that, uh, I'm really concerned
0 difference.
0 bad,
0 house a year ago, then I'm not being fairly appraised.
0 A:  Right.  There's no justification here for an increase in, uh, the value of
0 a home.  The property values are still going down, and I'm not sure they've
0 B:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #
0 A:  But I think it's unfair that, uh, the tax appraisal has gone up this year,
0 A:  # than # somebody else has.  And nobody comes out to take a look and see
1 getting it sprayed.  I think it was like, I can't remember, I'm sorry
1 B:  Or down here in Denison, yeah. 
1 A:  Okay, I live, I live in Plano, so it's north to me [laughter]. 
0 B:  I was going to say you didn't have the typical, you have a southern accent,
0 B:  # so I'm # famili-, uh, familiar with, uh,
1 A:  That area, that dialect. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Right, there's they, uh, I know what you're saying there, ours is the same
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 everything, so.
1 A:  And he rewired the house and it's shorting out here and there, and
0 A:  And then the power went off again, lightning or something knocked it out
1 B:  Oh boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there. 
0 A:  but, uh, oh, no, he didn't know what he was doing, he really should have
0 B:  Well that's something, my husband's in construction and he won't even touch
0 A:  Right, he'll end up killing himself. 
0 he'll go. 
1 so sorry,
0 paper down, and I mean just started from scratch.
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 don't know but it was leaking, just pouring water in and it all went through to
0 beam, we don't have concrete slab underneath our house,
0 things like that so we,
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  And so I, you know, am [laughter]  probably being very naive, I'm hoping
0 B:  Well, I guess, I, I, I guess my, my own opinion of, of, uh, government
0 are just there to keep the bureaucracy going.
1 B:  -- I feel like, I feel like too much government is too much government
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 almost dead before you can get in, you know, in a timely manner, because there
0 hours, you know, for just normal treatment. 
0 A:  # Right.  #
0 don't care how they finance it --
0 that's not run by a government to, you know, to run the program --
0 think?
1 B:  # I guess I, # I, I'm a, I'm a pessimist in that, in that respect
1 [laughter]. 
1 find out the other arguments in favor of, you know, so,
0 B:  But, uh, but that's, I guess that's I had not thought about before so,
0 A:  Right.  Well, it was nice talking to you. 
1 B:  # you # know, and, and, uh, so I'm about forty and whatever,
1 B:  So, yeah. 
0 A:  [Laughter]  So, I guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's
1 A:  -- it should be real interesting. 
1 A:  So, you think we're ready?
0 very wide, uh, it's been a big change. 
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 B:  But they don't have a national organization of men,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 B:  I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men
0 B:  # that # they've had to, you know, restructure, but I saw the greatest
1 B:  I got to get some for all my men friends,
1 B:  # it # says, let men run the world, women have more important things to do
1 [laughter]. 
0 A:  There you go [laughter].  There's a lot of truth in that. 
0 B:  And, and, you know, just sort of all s-, swooshed into one channel --
1 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 B:  -- sort of thing, it's, it's viva la difference [laughter], 
1 B:  -- and I think that you can truly respect the other person, I mean, you
1 you know.  Depends,
0 that, I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other --
0 A:  # Right.  #
1 B:  Do you have children?
1 B:  How did you do?
1 B:  # Oh, my.  #
0 B:  I, I tell you what.  I don't know what I would do without my friends having
0 it's,
1 A:  Just eight years. 
1 A:  # Yes.  #
0 A:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #
0 security.  That, I think that's being damaged, uh,
0 B:  I think,
0 when she can't, you know, the failure of that is,
0 A:  # Uh.  #
0 B:  Uh, you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for
1 B:  I mean, you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here. 
1 A:  # Right.  #
0 B:  That's true.  That's so true.  How, how did your daughter do it?
0 boys. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 computers might be useful and we did end up with, uh, I B M, P C -s, which I
1 A:  And twenty years ago I was, uh, in graduate school pecking out a
0 freshman in college --
0 that, getting away with the cards,
1 and we had to write code in binary and, uh, have it punched in on those little
0 cardboard cards [laughter] which,
0 B:  Uh, I think T V has a lot to do with the changes, too.  Don't you? In,
1 households, so --
0 A:  Yeah.  Certainly ten years ago, uh, V C R -s were just coming on the market
1 A:  I tape it and then watch it when it's convenient and that way I don't have
0 B:  That's always h-, convenient. 
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Yes, you can watch a program in forty-five minutes instead of an
1 hour [laughter].  You skip the commercials. 
1 B:  -- and now people have jam box with C D players in them, you know. 
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 uh, make a beep noise and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to
0 or a, a phone number to respond to and,
1 A:  # in # a theatre or something and you can still get your messages
0 B:  Where do you think it's, where do you think it's going to go in twenty
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  Oh, wow. 
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 years ago I was working in the medical center, uh, publishing a journal and
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  You think that's caused a lot of pressure on, like younger kids
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  I certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what, uh,
1 my kids were likely to be like.  Course, one of them was just a, a, a brand new
0 society with faxes and cellular phones and --
1 A:  Even when they're on another continent. 
0 A:  Yeah.  Even, you know, that reminds me, Federal Express was around ten
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 against life, but I, I think with the current war on drugs and all this kind
0 A:  sometime during their, their, uh, existence in that neighborhood.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 neighborhood, so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  So they're professionals?  
0 to the police force and the type equipment that they use.  Uh, it's, oh, right
0 B:  But, I mean, that's going to tend to, I mean it seems to me that sort of

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- he, his answer was, Oh, I gave him permission to, to miss.

1 movie.  Like she'll sit there and say, That won't happen, that can't happen,

0 A:  And ((that, uh)),
1 A:  When you [noise]  wrote it out in long hand you were a,
0 B:  Well, that's interesting. 
0 A:  And then I have one novel that's called FIRST LIGHT, that's about, uh,
0 B:  #Um.# 
1 or any of that kind of stuff.  My husband reads a lot of the, um, [lipsmack]
1 see, I've got one called ONE THOUSAND PRACTICAL PARENTING TIPS,
1 A:  Oh, hey.  That's,
1 A:  a nifty idea. 
0 B:  You know, [noise]  really. 
1 [noise]  that don't have those, so that's an alternate means of dealing with
0 B:  [Lipsmack] and all the O A literature and all the ((CODA)) literature, so
1 A:  they'll have all ten of those shown back [child]  to back,
1 B:  I know [laughter]. 
1 A:  in the middle of the night [laughter],  for people can video tape them. 
1 A:  # Yeah.  #

1 fact, it was called ((Tulley)) High School and now it's called Roberto Clemente
1 [laughter]. 
0 A:  Right, I agree with that, yeah. 
0 A:  Right, I mean, I'll give you and idea that I had, um, and I would say, I
0 school.  And, you know, Chicago, back then, even had bilingual classes. 
1 A:  # it # was, Spanish and English, so if you can imagine how I even go-,
0 [laughter], 
1 it looks like,
0 A:  # I've # been back up for a reunion.

0 Islands. 
0 resource transfer, if there is such a thing.

0 ties down there.  I don't know, the peop-, the, the, the, that's just children,
0 A:  # Not # speaking in English, um, having the children drive them everywhere,
1 B:  # And so th-, #
1 whatever,
0 really see, I couldn't see that there was a clear majority that, that stayed. 
1 B:  Oh, oh, I see, okay [laughter]. 
0 A:  I'm sorry [laughter]. 
1 B:  Uh, so, uh, I think T I, uh, likes to live in the middle of the road. 
0 A:  They're getting better, but, uh, there's room for improvement. 
0 didn't have, uh, a dental plan. 
0 B:  I'm, I have, I have used the dental plan several times for myself and also
0 it, it had, it had started becoming a thing that a lot of major companies were
1 plan as well. 
0 B:  # Yeah, the medical [laughter].  #
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah. 
0 A:  Something like that, uh, if they could cover that it would be, uh, most
0 guess it's just, you know, with insurance rates and medical costs being what
1 A:  # where there's a matched # savings contribution. 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, well I participate, uh, you know, I've I have participated
1 A:  # Right.  #
0 exactly what they do with that money. 
1 risk, I guess.
1 A:  # up # to a maximum of thirty dollars.

1 B:  No, it's okay. 
0 guess, I don't know.  But, um, just in nineteen, nineteen eighty-nine they
0 in the cafeteria or,
0 B:  # Huh-uh.  #
1 A:  # saying # President Reagan, can you see the President being tested. 
1 B:  Oh, I know [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, but,
0 B:  # Sure.  #
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  When I first started looking for work there wasn't any drug testing. 
0 A:  And I don't really want to be under the influence of somebody that is. 
0 B:  You know, they're, the, the sitcoms on T V that's like perfection and then
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  But that's always been going on. 
0 A:  Oh, yeah. 
0 A:  # but # he's told me it's went on.  But his buddy would be coming through
0 in command or whatever,
1 B:  Oh, gosh.  That is really scary. 
0 B:  Right.  That's true.  But it could just take one that is in charge of a, a
0 A:  The base my sister was on had a prison of their own which they, they,
0 B:  Oh, really?
0 A:  #They# seem to be having an okay time.  
0 fifty percent of, you know, my peers that I'm, in my circle of friends have
1 sure whether, uh, how strong the maternal instinct is going to be.  They tell
0 me it's going to be strong [laughter].  #Do you# --
0 B:  #Right.#
1 couple of years of university.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh, that's wonderful.
0 A:  That's wonderful.  #Yeah.#
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 that, uh, my boss, I'm very lucky though, again too, my boss is very akin to
0 family building.  So, I think that's som-, th-, something that couples need
0 A:  Oh, my goodness.  #You were# --
1 B:  It was constantly, no, #I don't want him,#
1 A:  #[laughter].#
1 B:  to explore anything.  He might, uh, he might hurt himself #[laughter].#
1 correct English #but (( )), you know# --
0 B:  Oh #that's silly.#
0 not because it's something I'll have to deal with sooner than later.  Uh, and
0 if the child is healthy, uh, and as long as we make it feel secure, I'd love
1 A:  Uh, maybe after two or three or, y-, years old.  I don't know.  Um.
0 B:  -- #your# kids need you [bird_squawk].
1 B:  No, I was in the Middle East.
0 A:  Uh, and we're just not set up for that.  Uh, #((with the)).#
1 A:  See, I think that's wonderful.  
1 A:  Right.
1 you can probably empathize with this.  It's amazing to me how forthcoming
0 A:  In terms of what to do.  Uh, and I just don't think there is a day, a good
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  And what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out and, uh, I
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- or, or, uh, giving it, you know, the whole job to somebody else to take
0 B:  #(( )).#
0 is a problem is that, uh, in terms of compensation to some of the child care
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 in terms of that with children?  Is that, is child care or that type of idea
0 B:  No.  Well, actually there was a daycare center, uh, where my son did go for
0 a year.  I think from when he was two to three.
0 Which is much like our neighbor --
0 thoughts.  I'm digressing here but, uh, I was just real curious when you said
1 A:  -- didn't mind me asking.  
1 B:  No, no.  And I didn't mean Israel.  So #you, you assumed right [laughter].#
1 many people work, I'm, I'm thinking oh, well she's going to, you know, because
1 B:  We've tried to go camping with them [laughter]  and the last time it wound
0 the tent [breathing]  because the kids wouldn't calm down, they wouldn't go to
0 [breathing]  --
1 and motor homes and things like that. 
0 A:  [Laughter]  So,
0 B:  Also I've found that when we've gone camping we've had some bad experiences
0 B:  # Oh, yeah, it's frightening.  #
0 B:  Yeah,
0 B:  # we went # to Yosemite and, uh, we went, we got a little cabin there and
1 B:  my body can't handle,
1 A:  # [Laughter].  #
0 B:  # that # anymore [laughter]. 
0 B:  I want a queen size air bed, you know, to go in the tent or something. 
0 B:  -- in the early part of it. 
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  # Contained.  #
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  Uh,
1 camp out.  But with a two year old and a three year old, three days without
1 B:  # I mean, I can't # imagine, you know, the diapers after three days, forget
0 A:  But, now, you know, uh, I know we'd like to maybe, you know, Disneyworld
0 A:  # pull one # or whatever and that might be kind, # of fun.  #
0 B:  # That would # be nice.  Yeah. 
1 you know, hiking into a campsite and,
1 campfire, you know,
0 A:  # I'm # not sure I'm up to it either, really. 
0 good stuff, huh.
1 and, you know, you, it was almost a competition.  But [breathing]  nowadays I
1 don't care [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah. 
1 backpacking in because it seems like our car's just totally loaded down with
1 going to strap them in their car seats at ten o'clock at night and then we'll
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  They'll fall asleep and we'll with able to [laughter]  enjoy nature. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Oh, I remember just like when we traveled you, you end up carrying
0 going so,
1 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 [breathing]  everything inclusive,
1 B:  # [Laughter].  #
1 A:  # vacation # [laughter]. 
1 mean it's just kind of like, no, no, not me. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  I guess. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  People actually call that fun. 
0 where she went, uh, now what do they call it when you go down the rapids, like
0 in these rubber boats and stuff, rafting or whatever.
0 A:  Oh, the white waters?
0 B:  # Expensive.  #
1 A:  # a # little drastic with kids, but for, you know, two adults,
0 B:  Unless you just go and wear them out so badly that they'd collapse by the
1 time they got off the raft they'd be [breathing], 
1 three or four days when they get home just to recuperate from it. 
1 A:  So, I don't know. 
1 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 they're ready for the afternoon, you know. 
0 the backyard and, uh, and just let her camp out. 
1 wants to come in, you know [breathing]. 
1 A:  She's six. 
0 real easy and just being outside during the summertime.
0 A:  # and she's ready # to come back in.  So I don't, I don't think camping
0 B:  No, that doesn't sound, too. 
0 B:  Yeah, when we were living in California, people all the time went in the
1 winter, you know, up in the mountains and stuff.  I don't know, I can't see
0 work till I was in high school, or junior high.  Or she did work, she worked
0 B:  I think it's certainly different, uh, I grew up probably earlier than you
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  And if they are going to work those kinds of hours, then I have to do that.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 practice, right?
1 B:  and they're astounded at the hours that I work.  
0 going to have to work it, too.  But, like a physician, it seems like, you
1 B:  But I think we got away from, from children a little bit there.
0 now is, you know, because I'm where you were probably twenty years ago, or, or
1 B:  Or too tired.  
1 A:  Or too tired [laughter].  
0 A:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.  No, I, actually I don't, but I can imagine.
1 B:  But you have all this fun to look forward to in the future. 
0 a puppy yesterday and it's sort of like a foreshadowing of what is going to
0 B:  Oh yes.  Just very,   
1 A:  Oh, we got a Rottweiler.  
0 B:  believe me. 
1 B:  -- licking my son's face now.  
0 child.  I mean I got two hours sleep last night, you know.  So,
0 supposed to spend time together, my husband's been off doing his thing all day
0 today, and I've been off doing my thing all day [barking] and I haven't
0 enjoy your hobby together, but my husband and I have different hobbies.
0 B:  No, no, he's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector.
0 B:  You know, laundry and, um, did some shopping and stuff. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 minutes and the same with their spouses.  This relative may work even a
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, it's true, um.  What's, what are some other questions they have,
0 was at the time.
0 stay home.
0 B:  Um, and they, they do a lot of volunteer work and they're real active in
0 home and be able to spend time with my kids.
1 A:  Hi.  Well what's your favorite team?  I like the Chicago Bears [laughter].
1 A:  The Cowboys?  Well, they haven't done much for, they never did much
1 A:  even when Landry and Staubach were playing.  I'm being real sarcastic.
0 B:  Oh yeah.  In fact most of the world liked them back then whether you did or
0 A:  and that was not the thing to be in Dallas when they, their preseason
1 can't remember his name off the top of my head.  I can picture his gray hair,
1 B:  and fact, uh, the best tight end in football is now their coach
0 [laughter].
0 A:  Eight-nine.  Yeah, Mr. Ditka.  Well, you can't say too much bad about him,
1 afternoon and he turned on the television, and one of the ladies said, what's,
1 A:  And I wasn't even aware, I mean, I knew it, but I just, I guess I kind of
0 A:  just not for fans, but I mean, what, what the salaries some of the
1 they're so tired, and the carbon, they're overcome by ama-, carbon monoxide
0 fumes [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.  Who do you think, uh, Chicago will have quarterbacking now?
0 A:  and it didn't matter who was playing, it just, it was worth watching.
0 A:  I'm not sure that I would agree with some of it.  But I still think it's
1 B:  it, at, Dallas would've won two Super Bowls that they didn't win because
0 A:  I can't even go back that far anymore [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 the other guy's hand he jerked it out of his hand, so it was,
0 A:  Yeah, usual-, usually when that happens, and I mean, it always seems to go
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  But that's really I guess, what I know about football [laughter].
0 A:  Pardon me?
1 A:  Yeah, it sure is [laughter].
1 motive was just another way to make a profit.
1 could remem-, I mean, I just, I mean, I used to think Dorsett was good.  Now I
0 look at him and I think, well, why did I ever think that [laughter]?
0 B:  Well, he was good in his younger days.  He r-, --
0 they're talking that, uh,
0 the last time I saw him play when he was healthy, he looked mighty good.
0 and the main reason he's been hurt on occasion, it's like most of them, the
0 offensive line didn't do it's job, he got blindsided or something.
1 sports [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.
0 that you did with your children when they were growing up?
0 B:  and things of that sort, and,
1 rockets, so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets
1 [laughter].
1 A:  #we live near Washington,# so we, we would always go in for the museums.
0 B:  [Noise] Uh.
1 A:  so our whole family, we take family trips to different places to visit
1 B:  My goodness, uh.
1 depth, #I guess.  But, we would,#
1 A:  #[Laughter] (( )) I don't think we've,# we've missed a fish store on the
1 A:  so we did, you know, we did try, and of course we learned too.
0 B:  #But I (( )) yet.#
0 A:  That's right.
1 B:  but it's not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly
0 school.
0 tumbled out.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  No, I, I, I realize that, but it's funny, they don't always do
0 A:  and you want to be avail-, at least I've wanted to be available, when
0 B:  Uh-huh
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  Yeah.  And I, I just sort of think --
0 uh, the model, the role models that get the, the, the family issues that get
0 A:  That's, yeah.  Well, we've always, we have had this tradition, um, that we
0 always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Well, o-, ours is, uh, #a friend# --
1 things,
0 A:  uh, pieces of candy.  So, I think as they're getting in college, I just,
0 B:  Well, you were saying what other trends are there, and one just occurred to
0 A:  Yes, yes,
0 A:  The b-, yes, and the broken families.  We, um, as I said, living in an area
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  # and # horrible real estate taxes,
1 get rid of it, so they took and offer I gave them, which was very low.  I know
0 A:  Huh. 
0 B:  And, uh, so he's kind of knocked down the neighborhood for a little while,
0 B:  # until # that, that average goes out. 
0 half acre lot. 
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 B:  # half # acre lot and you can clip the lawn with a pair of scissors. 
1 done.  I just, I can't do it.  You know,
0 B:  -- and I come back it's rained quite a bit while we're gone,
1 A:  # Oh.  #
0 B:  # I # can hardly find the house [laughter]. 
0 week down there if I had the inclination, which I didn't.  But, uh, that's
0 when I started, and when I lived in Florida I had my yard done down there,
0 I had to, I, I bought myself, I bought the, the best of equipment, I said if
0 A:  Oh.  okay. 
0 lime and spread fertilizer,
1 B:  # and # pull up dandelions,
1 look at my lawn and,
0 A:  But, you know, usually there, in this, uh, new, I've got one on this,
0 A:  -- but I can't hear them for some reason and, uh, uh, I like living real
0 A:  And the, the noise isn't real, I say I can't hear this, and when I lived in
0 coming in D F W and I, I know if they're two seconds apart, I just watch the
1 B:  Is that your version of counting sheep?
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].  I guess so. 
1 about it. 
0 only had like eightch-, eight points --
0 you normally pull for, the, the Mavericks or,
1 everything out there in, in California.  Uh, and it also helps when they were
0 of the categories there isn't, uh, a Laker in the top ten usually hardly any,
0 A:  -- and, uh, yet the Lakers continue to win.  So, you're right, I think they
0 stay out for two or three weeks at a time.  So, it really gets, you know, I
1 B:  -- and I imagine that really helps his back. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  He ought to have his own bed come along with him, you know
0 know a, jeez, it was like, uh, uh, thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  [Laughter]  Oh, I don't know, did you ever play much basketball?
1 B:  Yeah, and they don't wear any pads (( )).
0 with elbows all the time. 
0 A:  Yeah.  Several years ago when I was up in, uh, Cleveland, I was staying at
0 the Marriott and the Cavaliers were playing somebody.  I think it was like
1 seven feet tall and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds.  So,
0 A:  I used to go down to Reunion Arena, uh, went down there a couple years on
0 B:  Utah, Portland, Boston and Detroit. 
0 B:  Oh, no, uh,
1 that team since they got rid of Tom Landry, that was just like, you know,
1 A:  # you # know, just because it is a Texas team, but I cannot stand Jimmy
0 B:  Can't stand Jimmy Johnson or Jerry,
0 A:  # Right.  #
1 B:  When your team keeps getting these stupid penalties,
0 given day they could do anything --
0 B:  -- and then on another day, but, they, the consistency,
0 B:  # just # when it really gets down to the championship,
0 A:  -- and I really, you know, as far as future of the Cowboys I really hate to
0 B:  # years # and then they start,
0 was extremely involved in that, in that aspect.
0 know, when I, I watch it and then I start sort of seeing myself enjoying it,
1 A:  # and # they're, of course they're not from Texas, so that riled everybody
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  It's,
0 involved in it,
0 B:  Well, I tend to, tend to, uh, well, when my son was still at home, uh --
0 A:  # Right.  #
0 B:  # and # I was involved, but I tend not to watch things so much now, unless,
0 just out there playing around.  They don't, uh, they don't really, they don't
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Has he been there couple, three years?
0 He was out for maybe, you know, four or five games so,
0 B:  -- and played in one game, you know, we made some playoffs or something
0 B:  # and # my mom has never watched football hardly in her life,
1 B:  # and # she sat there with me,
0 B:  Oh. 
0 all of our holidays center on what time is the game start, [laughter] you
0 A:  -- and I'm a U T freak, too. 
0 A:  -- and it needs light moments. 
0 A:  # No.  #
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 tape. 
0 A:  And then we'll go down to the video store and rent them, and, look at them.
0 A:  Oh, that was, that was excellent.  That was,
0 A:  Some work, but most of them don't.  I think they're trying too hard on the
0 B:  It was based on a true story. 
1 B:  Well, they, uh, they almost didn't make it back in a couple cases
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.  No,
0 A:  # you # know, the, the gory ones. 
1 like FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH and them.
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 
0 A:  Or THE TERMINATOR.  Right, he came back from the future. 
0 A:  Nope, nope.  Uh, {pause} yes, yes, maybe it was TOTAL RECALL. 
0 B:  Yeah, that was tough. 
0 wife's case, she is a very independent sort, uh, you know, she, she has a lot
0 B:  Right and, and I think that's very important [cough].
0 B:  Attorneys and lawyers, I'm an accountant, a C P A and, uh, I know quite a
0 uh, in, uh, a firm say, do you think, uh, a woman C P A gets paid equally to a
1 liberation.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  And I gu-, I ha-, I think the woman pretty much has to do it themselves.
0 good bit of their business life before they get into politics and, and I think
1 A:  Yes and,
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 for, for many years have thought about, uh, women in the working world, 
1 a male chauvinist, or a female chauvinist.
0 just need to get them all put together. 
1 And I really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast.
1 good.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah, that's really good.  That's, um, I've found that when I, I don't
0 B:  Yes [clicking].
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  And in the, in the morning I try to sleep because it's, it's dark thirty.
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  But in, but in the afternoon, uh, I try to read so I can, can, uh, not pay
1 attention to what our driver is doing [laughter].
1 it, there's really, uh, most people have relocated to the Washington area,
0 A:  Yeah, and then came a woman that's um, she's big in the Democratic
1 B:  Uh-huh, yeah.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  They didn't call you for Mother's Day?
0 or whatever, I, I really enjoyed it.  It's, it's so funny when you live in one
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  And my husband has bow hunted through the years as well as hunt with a gun,
1 B:  [Lipsmack] [breathing] this isn't just really great hunting country
0 and it was kind of that, you know, same kind of theory then, you know, that,
0 A:  Yeah, well I agree.
0 B:  or whatever.  
1 B:  But, on the other hand, we've eaten a lot of [breathing] raccoon and possum
0 B:  All my, I have a little grandmother in Oklahoma, 
1 and,
0 have a whole lot of patience with people who, who don't want to talk about
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  Kroger, or, whatever and buy their chicken and their meat and come home
0 listen to the news tonight, and went after his teacher, and fired three or
0 [breathing] militarily sophisticated types of weapons.  Mercenary type things,
0 ranges are hard to, we have them here in Arlington, uh, one here in Fort Worth
0 A:  My brother in law's in San Antonio and he, uh, they're, they're closing,
1 that,
0 somebody came, with, with a nonhunting one of these and he was just, you
0 A:  Pardon me.  
0 gun before he would step in front of you.  And so you need some sort of common
0 scouts.  Does, does, scouting have a gun section where they, they teach them
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 guess you might say, and I think we have to look at it as it's not going to
1 was within driving distance. 
1 B:  -- because I'm, I'm not in physical shape for something like that, but, uh,
1 I, I sure would work on it [laughter], 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  -- uh, but, we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip.  We
0 B:  Uh, and we couldn't get enough people together, uh, to go, so it ended up
0 B:  # Yeah, we, #
0 B:  # and I really enjoyed that because, # you know, the mountains were real
0 A:  Not so much, huh?
0 A:  I know that, uh, uh, one of, one thing that happens to us to vacation trips
1 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of, of a rather
0 different parts of the country.  I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to
1 A:  # a # small camper.  We've, we've travelled in a big one.  I hate them
0 weeks there,
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 you know, he'll say, this is my itinerary.  I'm going here, here and here and
0 and around there, where the, where the early history is, there's some
0 went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that. 
1 a change. 
1 B:  As long as I have a shower nearby, I'm fine [laughter]. 
0 A:  Well, I'm with you.  I need my creature comforts, too. 
0 A:  No, I don't.
0 B:  And that, Richardson is one of the school districts that would be hit by
0 sometimes, um, about him, but the one thing he did a few years back in testing
0 A:  Well I was in a rural area in Wisconsin, 
1 white.  We had, uh, no minorities at all.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah, uh-huh.
1 get harassed by their peers,
1 B:  This is true, yes, I can personally relate to that, yes.
0 ever, you know,
0 B:  in terms of getting children to think independently.
0 B:  and, i-, there were things that I probably knew about in other segments
0 A:  Yeah.
1 divorced, too, but I can't remember ever, I mean it was sort of just like, uh,
0 A:  Well I remember as a kid, uh, they had P T A,
0 A:  Parent Teacher Association meetings all the time,
1 B:  Association, yeah.
0 son is very good looking, what is he, well, he's nineteen, he graduated last
0 said he did, really didn't want to study, and he goes, and you know he leaned
0 A:  Yeah, well the, the dropout rate is so high in Dallas and Fort Worth, uh,
1 A:  Every one.
0 B:  Oh, you haven't?
0 B:  Yeah.  I didn't use to, but now I really, because I get so angry about what
1 goes on and then I feel like I can't really complain too much, unless
0 A:  Oh, liberal, by, what do you mean by liberal, um.
0 so. 
0 A:  Well see, I don't know anything about politics.  
0 B:  Oh, you don't?
0 especially after Desert Storm, but, um, I think back in the ei-, times when,
0 more like aggressive in war and more pro war,
0 B:  and pro aggression and, um, the Democrats were the Doves, they were more
0 B:  So, so have you ever voted at all?
0 A:  No, I never have.
1 B:  How old are you?
1 A:  [Laughter] I'm twenty-six.  
0 B:  Well.
0 A:  If they could {pause} make it more, oh, easier to find out, you know,
0 what's going on.  Do you know what I mean?
0 A:  Like, uh, like to me, I don't, I didn't know what would have been wrong
1 yeah. 
0 Dukakis and Bush was.
0 demo-, uh, the government,
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 they're for, because they can slant that too.
1 A:  And everybody's got, you know, stuff they don't want known.
1 B:  Right, everybody's got a secret [laughter].  So,
0 B:  Well that's okay.  Do you think,
0 A:  you know.
0 A:  if people stopped thinking like that.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote Democrat,
1 A:  No.
1 B:  And that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved [breathing]
0 A:  I don't know, if I did understand politics I probably would vote more,
0 A:  And then, I didn't think that was right, because he may have been a good
0 A:  But because it, what, he had an affair,
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah.  
0 A:  Which I guess if you got turmoil in your personal life, you're going to
0 that much to do with, um, unless they've done something really horrible, you
0 B:  That's right.
1 looks like a McDonald's commercial, you know.
1 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].
1 B:  people just had a picture of Carter as not being real capable, but he,
0 B:  You did?  Have you heard stuff about him lately, do you know what he's
0 B:  When was it out?
0 A:  Um, it's still out now, uh, it came out I guess about a month or, about a
0 B:  Yeah, I saw that one, that was pretty good.
1 doing the Kennedy movie that's coming out, um, and there's one,
0 called Judgment City. 
0 B:  uh, I can't remem-, the other, the other actor, uh,
0 A:  Yeah, I didn't get to see that.
0 A:  One of my favorite movies, it's not one that I haven't seen, I, w-, it's
1 B:  HOME ALONE.
0 gone out to see it.#
0 B:  Yeah that's,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I know it's [throat_clearing], it's obnoxious,
0 B:  it, it cost me, you know, twenty bucks, easy.
0 B:  and have good food for ea-, eat for thirty dollars.
0 B:  Yeah, the problem is you always have to wait until they're out.
1 B:  Well.
0 A:  Well that's about all the movies I've seen recently [laughter].
0 A:  Was that Arnold Schwarzenegger?
0 A:  Yes, that was, that, that might be one of my all time favorites too, that
0 Hospital, uh, near to where I live and they were saying that some of the
0 B:  Huh.
1 A:  Oh, I haven't heard anything about it.  I, but I don't like Steven Seagal
1 similar title like, uh, I don't know some, I don't know, some macho title.
0 A:  I just don't like the, yeah, it is, I, I don't like that a lot.  I don't
0 watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either.
0 B:  You expect more out of, uh, Julia Roberts, though.
1 A:  Yea-, well I saw half of it, and I remember I was in school, I saw half of
0 that, I, I, uh, I remember that movie,
0 B:  and, uh, it was, I mean I got in to it, and, uh,
0 B:  yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, uh, I can't put it exactly on the lines of
0 B:  kind of on that end, you know, you get these twists and, it's usually
0 pretty good, but, uh.
0 losing its originality or something.  I don't, I can't pin, pinpoint it.
1 B:  Um, one thing that I definitely have noticed in our area as far as the
0 but, at, at least for a show, we're involving more parents in input and,
0 A:  So.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  you know, there are a lot of women now, and I think it's good because
1 don't always, you know, they're just there to drive the bus, you know,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And they just, she just lost out to someone from the Dallas area, like
0 that there, there wasn't a women principal, from elementary school on up.
0 A:  And you tend to see more, I think you see more, well I don't know, it
0 of Texas without a, uh, without a certificate. 
0 A:  You can teach?
0 B:  but it's not career money.
0 B:  Um, {pause} your, uh, city, you know, where they, they adopt a highway
1 know, you just get rid of it, you roll the window down, and you throw it out.
0 B:  because we're the ones voting for those people,
0 back and forth between courts to, you know.
0 something to the team.  But, uh, I think they need to let him go, maybe. 
0 watch the mailman play for the,
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  That's, that's, I mean you've named like four of the top names in the game
1 and then you come up with Danny Ainge. 
1 A:  Yeah, he's, uh, well I have nothing against him, I just, uh,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  And, uh, I like Larry Bird because he's from the home state also. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 works for them [breathing],  but then it's just not always there. 
0 B:  English did okay. 
0 A:  Okay. 
0 B:  Yeah, that's true. 
1 know who he is.
0 guess I like it because of, of the quickness of it.  Uh, and, and I like it
0 B:  I keep up with that.  So,
0 accomplishment if, if they hit, you know, some three pointers or something.
0 A:  Takes a lot of working. 
0 like, you know, bass fishing and so forth.
0 A:  They have mostly small mouth in them or,
0 there's, we have large mouth, small mouth, uh, sort of musky, pike, stuff like
0 A:  Wow. 
0 A:  # and # it's huge, its, its mouth was full of hooks. 
1 water they,
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 release, right there. 
0 B:  Yeah, I know it.  Have you ever tried, uh, deep sea fishing?
0 know, what they, mackerel --
0 B:  If you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day. 
0 B:  I think we're probably close, though. 
0 B:  Bye-bye. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  we want here [laughter]. 
1 A:  I want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac [laughter]. 
1 B:  Hey, that sounds like a great deal to me [laughter].  You have great

1 inside, outside, you know, we've redone the body, repainted it, detailed it,
1 player in it,
1 B:  and, uh, I don't know, I think it just soured me on it for some reason
0 uh, and I think my, my mother drives the SeVille now that's, uh, I guess it's
0 A:  Oh, yeah, I remember those.
0 A:  That she may want to save, if she, she doesn't have it anymore.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  I know.

1 B:  Yeah.  I know that, uh, I've, I've sort of always felt like with Buicks it
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 again and I'm like, oh, please, it looks exactly the same as this old one
0 B:  Really.  
0 A:  they were standard Cadillacs but they really looked beautiful. 
0 B:  Oh, okay, because I have, 
0 A:  And I like engines they had a lot of broken down engin-, 
0 B:  Right,  
0 A:  I thing so, because they've been making these four cylinder and six
0 A:  so, uh, 
1 engineer but he cannot, I mean, or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with
0 know.
1 go out to think about a new car or buy another car, I don't think about, well,
0 is this engine that I can work on [laughter] or that, you know,
0 B:  That's pretty good, it's really been funny because we have like been you
0 husband Carl has called all over the country, you know, he's gotten these
0 [Noise] [TV].
1 B:  Um, actually quite a, a, a while.  Um, I've lived here for six years and,

0 B:  Oh, is that right? 
0 B:  Um, our dog, Joey, has, uh, a back problem.

0 in the afternoon.
0 you know, run into people with problems.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 and probably large dogs.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  But anyway, at least she can go and she's not limping along and all that.
1 him in and, uh, he's about two years old now and he loves his treats, uh,
1 A:  Well of course.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 dogs, dogs are so well trained, anytime they hear your voice, they come.  So
0 B:  Oh, yeah [laughter].
0 A:  I'm not either, but, 
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, I see.
1 A:  Yeah it so fo-, much fun to talk to you.
0 B:  [Laughter] All right, have a good one.
0 A:  # so # it's a contract garbage pickup and it's all thrown together. 
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  But now they do it in paper bags.  And they do say that it is paying for
0 B:  # And # it's, they, they will, you will, they will also be picked up at the
0 because most of the facilities that would take it were, uh,
1 picked up, you know, some other way.  Um, and then the plastic, um, you know,
0 A:  That is nice and, I've read articles here, uh, about the confusion involved
0 newspaper, which they say ruins the whole batch, and, uh,
0 B:  Well they do try to control that by giving a little instruction. 
0 about that in general, as long as it's the newspaper because there's not, you
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  # some # can.  Now even our grocery stores here, we have two different
0 B:  # that, of the plastic bags.  But you # see, I'm, I have a problem with
0 B:  # which we # are, we do get a choice because I know that's biodegradable. 
1 B:  Oh, not very convenient then. 
1 B:  Yeah, well actually it's called Charlotte, now, they used to be called
0 Linda, grew up, uh, during World War Two and we saved papers and tin foil, and
0 too complicated, 'cause people in general are just lazy and in the schools
0 adults are the ones that have to lead the way.  And, they have required the,
0 because that's what most of the, uh, you know, the little trays that they have
0 they were, metal even, trays in, in the cafeterias in our schools but,
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Probably one of the worst things we ever done to ourselves
0 B:  # two jillion, # I'm sure.  So, event-, it will take a time, but, um, I, I
1 A:  # the-, they're talking # about environment [laughter]. 
0 B:  # Um, # I, I find that there is a percentage of, of, uh, the student body,
1 of those who are aware and making an effort to do something about it, those
1 A:  Rome, New York, okay, well, Texas, [squeak]  let me look at my husband and
0 B:  # uh, # just the existence of, you know, murder, rapist, whatev-, wh-,
0 A:  # Right, any (( )),#
0 B:  # you know, #
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 A:  Yeah, and Texas is having a problem right now and it's, the, the, the, the,
1 over crowded, and you think how is, is everybody that stupid or is the world
1 basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over
0 and listed me as a reference --
0 A:  -- and how they just exe-, well, it hasn't been just but it was in the, I
0 should be more cases like that where they flip a sw-, I might be too cold too,
0 A:  # I don't # know,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  # No.  #
0 facts that they said it was true --
1 end of, you know how they have these mini dramas, at the end they said, this
0 B:  Great. 
0 A:  is that and, and, is that like near Albany or Syracuse,
0 B:  uh, it use to be --
0 A:  # Sure.  #
1 B:  # no there isn't the # harsh crime and all. 
1 sarcastic, it's just a great,
1 B:  # [Laughter].  #
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 new jails that, I mean, they really are over,
0 B:  I think, I think Penn-, Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because I'm
0 from, uh,
1 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  # oh, # well, we'll forgive each other [laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh, because they use to be very, very conservative when I was growing up I
0 B:  # Right.  #
1 all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so. 
0 B:  # probably # pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and
1 A:  -- but, I don't know, methods of capital punishment I have no opinions on
0 A:  Is it, uh, how about the injection,
0 A:  # is that suppose to # be. 
0 B:  yeah, that would be even, yeah, I didn't even,
0 been back here long enough to, to realize whether or not,
0 people vote in national elections.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 fairly small and you, and most of the people you tend to know at least the
0 B:  Well that would be nice, yeah [clink]. 
0 most politicians when they first get into politics, they want to do a good
0 B:  I don't know much about that at all.  What do you mean, like when you vote
0 they, they should do it, or shouldn't. 
0 B:  I'm no, I'm in Denison, Texas, up north,
0 did you say. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  # And # it's, uh, they probably should limit the, the terms of office to no
0 uh, for the good of the, the town, or the people in the town, or not. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  # and # if I could keep a follow-up on the candidates running.  Like right
0 the mayors, like Koch, in New York, I don't even know who's mayor down here in
0 that can sway an election, one way or another.  Um, I don't even think running,
0 amount of things,
0 B:  # or, yeah, shortly after.  #
0 B:  Oh, I'm sure they do. 
0 B:  I don't know, I could check into that. 
0 you have to vote.  I've always, I've always voted, I even though sometimes it's
1 credit cards you need to use that policy, I think, don't you?  [Ringing].
1 B:  Right.   
0 B:  I think a lot of people go in debt because they think, oh, you know, I can
0 B:  #Yeah.#  
0 A:  Right.  That can be very handy under those kind of circumstances.  The
0 If you,
1 A:  a car.  So, so they, they have become a very vital part of our, of our

1 A:  that are trying to work out and, uh, [laughter].  Poor thing he comes
0 use credit cards, you know, with a big write off at the end of the year.
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 well, I'm not, other than that, I don't have too much on credit cards but,
0 B:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  everyone in the world does, I guess, and occasionally it actually balances,
1 A:  # and, # uh, after I got married, no, it just didn't work anymore.  She
1 spends a lot.  She likes to spend on anything and everything [laughter].  With
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  # where # we put it, we have a separate, a third account even, a savings
0 account in, in an entirely different bank --
0 A:  Well, uh, in information systems.  I'm a voice researcher. 
0 B:  Oh, okay.  I'm in, uh, psycholinguistics, actually. 
1 A:  Yeah.  So does mine. 
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].  What we do is, we take money out of her, out of her
0 paycheck each week. 
1 there and it stays there and it builds up until we need it for something. 
1 A:  Yeah.  See, I think we might have to do that [laughter]. 
1 have to save a little money.  I don't know if my paltry graduate student fees
1 B:  Right. 
0 you know, presents and gifts and things for,
0 B:  Right.  Exactly, but that to her is sort of like a waste. 
1 B:  But she does her nails.  So,
1 A:  I know, and those nails are so expensive [laughter]. 
0 A:  Oh, gosh.  I was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her
0 A:  Yeah.  It's funny. 
0 A:  # I # think that's, uh,
0 dollars in tuition, really doesn't cover living expenses.  Um,
1 B:  # (( )). #
0 She doesn't live within her professional income, you know.  So I just get a,
0 increase then.
1 still, uh, we're still pretty close.  I knew her spending habits and they're
0 B:  # [Laughter]  Oh, wow.  #
1 A:  # they haven't changed # at all, you know. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  I don't argue with her, but I just get all, it must show in my face. 
0 B:  Had some money in her pocket, yeah. 
1 and she said everything was on sale.  Oh, oh, that's good, at least it was on
1 sale [laughter]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  That's good honey, I'm glad you bought it on sale [laughter]. 
0 B:  # recently, # where it was pathe-, I mean, it was horrible.  I mean, half
0 but it cost us, you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree
0 down. 
0 of the cars died, you know.  All of this adds up and that ((for savings))
0 A:  # Huh-uh.  #
0 that is stereotyped, I think. 
0 A:  # and did # it well and all that.  But, uh,
0 A:  And,
0 B:  You know, certainly my brothers would,
0 two sisters actually had to work and not go to school,
0 A:  # Huh-uh.  #
1 B:  # out # of college, um, and so, you know, I was not in a situation where I
0 A:  # Huh-uh.  #
0 A:  So I see, I see the work force out there.  And I see a lot of um, like just
1 responsibilities are greater than the C E O -s, uh,
0 B:  And they go to the hospital. 
0 B:  And one parent, I guess the, the, uh, father was killed?
1 A:  Oh. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 attitude of women working comes about because children remember the traumas of

1 A:  -- so they let me stay home and work in the garden [laughter].

1 blood and, uh, shootings.  And I certainly don't go to horror films.
1 A:  If they are trying on purpose to scare me then I don't want to go [noise].

0 A:  you slide all over the place.
1 could make a U turn in a bike, I can do it in my car, but I tried to do it on
1 but I've never been camping in eleven years of marriage, so that tells you
1 something [laughter]. 
0 A:  So camping, camping is not your bag [laughter]. 
0 A:  I got my  fill of it. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  there's  a lot to do there and it's reasonably priced.  Of, of all the

0 B:  But it's like anything else, it's not all it's cracked up to be when you're
0 A:  Uh, not, no, not really there.  Most of, most of mine has been in, uh,

0 that spicy.
1 well. 
1 or whatever, and dream on.# 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different

0 I'm going to put wood in there.
0 B:  Um, and I haven't even decided as far as, um, what kind of paint to buy.
1 A:  Yeah, I was about to say, you ought to experiment on at least a small part
0 B:  Uh-huh, inside.
0 A:  Well, uh, we used a latex, uh, wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for
1 A:  where I'd use a small brush and, uh, try to keep the paint from dripping
0 without too much trouble.  If it's really old, you don't know what it's put on
0 sixties style.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Um, in one bathroom it's, um, it's probably paper, uh, it's silver, silver
1 and yellow,
0 A:  Um, uh-huh [laughter].
1 turquoise, and lime green and silver, and, uh, a little bit of yellow that
0 B:  Yeah, well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it
0 would be just plain painting.  
0 B:  Yeah, okay.
1 A:  Because it, it rips as you pull it off for one thing and then you end up
1 B:  Well I really appreciate all the helpful tips, I think you are, just made
1 B:  If you were, if you were closer I'd, I'd, I'd tell you you could come over

1 try the sponge painting.  I think that could give it a really a,
0 all you do is put on another coat. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 you know, that's, that's my major complaints, I guess.  What about you?
0 A:  Yeah, and a lot of times they turn down your claims so that leaves you
0 others that you're dissatisfied with?
1 B:  Yeah, I'm not familiar with that sort of thing, but you know, to me
0 B:  Right.  But, um, otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits
0 B:  Um, but, you know I suppose some places are, are more stringent about that
0 they enforce the rules. 
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, um, benefits,
0 B:  Right.  I mean, sure, the payroll is lower that way, but I would assume
0 that the productivity is way down, also.
0 onto them.
0 B:  Yeah, I'm from Indiana. 
1 A:  Great, I'm glad you are, I'm not. 
0 A:  Since you're being, you can talk for hours, go ahead, you, you, if you like
0 can play --
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  You know, it's just sad because, I mean, Purdue, even though they're one of
0 and,
0 A:  He should be playing, they all should be playing another team that, that
0 B:  Like. 
0 B:  That's what happened to this guy.  I mean, he was, uh, he didn't go to
0 kind of score a hundred twenty five points, you know, (( )) hundred twenty-two,
0 you know, and I don't really get much out of that. 
1 B:  I'm kind of racist, I guess, when I say, I like to see the white guys do
1 athlete,
0 B:  Yeah.  And, you know, it's like if they don't win, they don't get any
0 money, so, and the school suffers, which is kind of bad, but that's just how
0 A:  It just seems so sad to have to only rely on, you know, college football.

0 bask-, football game in high school that had that many. 
1 basketball up there.  The Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd

1 he loves that.  He, he would be, this is a great question for him, uh,
1 But, I, I, I can't get interested at all, zero. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 trade-off between what, you know, what, you got to find out what a kid wants
0 B:  You know, just go up and show up, and stay up all day, and, and you know,
0 A:  Yeah.  Did either of your parents go to college?
0 B:  Right.
0 over their house quite often and eat and spend time with them, and at the
0 are they going to be called brownnoser, when, uh, so it's just sort of
0 B:  Right.
0 they're really good in academics.
1 A:  or you go to a university or a major college, there are n-,
0 A:  to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently --
1 B:  Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.  My only concern is what happens when
0 B:  #Do they# wind up with more red tape, and #more problems then?#
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  As a matter of fact, if I'm injured or have an emergency when I'm, say in

1 A:  That's about it.
0 B:  Uh-huh [laughter].
0 B:  Well, that's, that is really nice.

0 another step or another direction.  I know the day I left, it was real funny.
1 was just talking to someone seeing whether or not I couldn't hire you back
0 A:  Oh.
1 A:  And, uh, I can't, I can't afford to leave, and I can't afford to leave the
1 B:  Oh, I understand, that's where I was from.  Um, I'm terrible at staying on

0 neighbo-, how many people, how many houses in your area have pools?
0 B:  You don't, you, you don't really tend to use it as much as you anticipate

0 B:  I could not believe it.
0 B:  Are they intermixed very well or does it seem to be streets, 
1 B:  [Sigh].
0 B:  Oh, that's, that's kind of what I left.  It's not quite as, wasn't quite as
0 B:  Well that's great.  I hope you'll appreciate this, I was just smiling as

0 uh, I, I, I'm concerned that we're letting too many, that we don't have enough

0 B:  Yeah.
0 war, and,
0 uh, the immigration of back and a-, forth across Mexico, uh --
0 B:  -- I guess it's what they, their, the Mexican kids get a good education
0 daytime to come over here and work --
0 A:  -- and they have green cards.  And, uh, then, like you said, a lot of, I
0 concentrated toward the borders, and, uh, it's more, um, the immigration is
0 tied in with, uh, drug trafficking.  So they have to watch out who comes in,
0 and, and they're always finding drugs on, you know, on the most, um, [talking]

0 B:  Oh yeah, I, I, I think that certainly is a problem.  I guess our

0 B:  Yeah, sometimes common sense should take over rather than, yeah, that's a

0 A:  #I, I think I, I agree with# you that the problem seems to be they don't

1 A:  Two and a half [laughter].
0 A:  was that with that blonde, she pretended to be the boss or something.
1 A:  Yeah, I rented that one night by myself.  I was home alone.  Did you see

0 B:  Course I work in a defense proj-, company, so naturally [laughter] #I'm for
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  but he got people to do it, came up with a, a whole book's worth of
1 A:  #Anyway,# there was this whole book that came out and I read some excerpts
1 sensible --
1 A:  #And ev-,#
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 place.
0 A:  Well, I'm in favor of spending money on a strong defense, but not of
1 B:  Absolutely, I, jus-, what's wrong with that?
1 A:  Then the same spare parts can be used [laughter] --
0 B:  Yeah, yes, I know. 
0 time.  I'm right at D F W airport so #we're# --
0 A:  #Oh,# yeah.
1 A:  Well, that's good, but that's, that's small comfort because it doesn't
1 bring you any income until you sell it [laughter].
1 because we had proposition thirteen that says --
0 and San Francisco, too, I think, the p-, prices of #real estate is so high.#
0 B:  Oh, #are you?#
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  [Laughter] #Yeah.#
1 cards.  We don't handle them very well [laughter].
1 rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa,
1 B:  -- for, I had, I had an American Express, American Express Gold, an Optima,
0 getting us in some real serious trouble.
0 A:  Oh, sure.
0 them to you.
1 year.
0 A:  Yeah, forty five.  Right, uh, [laughter] I,
0 --
0 B:  -- if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash --
0 A:  Well, and also in a sense, they're giving you a loan for a month so that --
0 to the price of what I buy,
0 B:  -- before we're completely out of the hole.  But I think this, they way the
0 A:  -- I guess because I never experienced it.  And it's not, because you know,
0 if you really get into the mind set, I got really good at juggling money and
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- [Laughter] and my husband's too, because he's, he's the same way I am.
1 B:  -- incidental type things, like, you know, gas and stuff like that.
0 couldn't because my son's tuition came due, and I guess I had, you know, not
0 B:  I can imagine.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 it cost me sixty dollars more to have them.
1 B:  Uh-huh.  Think about what you can buy for sixty dollars.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And I would much rather own my own home than, than be renting it like we're
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 over and over til they found a party for me to talk to [laughter],
0 B:  -- that sounds good.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 bag with a little parmesan cheese and flour and then, uh, quickly, uh, fry up
0 A:  And then you serve it on rice, and it's really a, a pretty low cholesterol
0 A:  #And# it's very popular and it looks very pretty,
0 A:  and, uh, with rice and a salad, you've got a, a meal.
0 A:  Um.
1 B:  Oh, did you? [Laughter].
0 B:  But, uh, we, we have not been there, uh, since last summer, but, uh, it's,
0 B:  Course I'm not supposed to eat fried oysters any more, but that's, uh, we
1 B:  [Throat_clearing] [Cough].
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  So, uh,
1 A:  [Laughter] Not my favorite part [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Well, the reason for using those is that it makes such a pretty colorful
0 B:  Right.
1 A:  And oh, they are wonderful.  That, uh, he does that, uh, uh, chicken with
1 cashews and szechuan peppers and he also, not at the same meal [laughter],
0 fajitas --
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 least half of the people that I know are on some kind of a low fat diet for
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah.  We have found that, uh, since we've stopped eating so much beef and
0 you know, when she eats, uh, some kind of a beef dish, if it's the, the least
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Right.
0 done, and sprinkle a little of that on it, and then I add some lemon thyme
1 B:  Yeah.  You know it's, uh, about fifteen minutes until noon here, and we're,
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 my appetite going.
1 terrible lunch here today for the cholesterol people because, uh, we're going
1 to have Italian sausage and French fries [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Right, yeah.  Okay, well, it's been nice talking to you, and, uh,
1 B:  #and I did not.#
1 A:  #if I can ask? [laughter].#
0 A:  How old are you?
0 A:  -- uh, they're talking about, uh, just service in general, and, um, I, I
0 did a lot of this sort of thing in, in college in the summers.
1 worthwhile experience.  So, in theory, I'm in favor of this.  But on the other
1 hand, I'm an economist [laughter].
0 serve for a year in any capacity.  So, uh, you know, uh, uh, the idea is
1 service.  There was nothing about voluntary.
0 B:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, then, then I guess that's, you know [laughter],
0 B:  [Sneezing] Uh, at any rate, I guess my idea is that, that if we're going
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- [Laughter] and let the, let these nat-, this national service take care
0 bureaucratic agencies.
0 A:  -- from other jobs I mean.  So there's, it's not, it's not a real cut and
1 B:  -- you know, in-, instead of just military, uh,
0 which was a domestic Peace Corps some --
0 A:  -- time back.  And probably coming from Texas you may have bumped into some
0 of that.
0 just as a, an enlistee, uh, the wage isn't anything great.
1 A:  So I guess, that it, a lot of thinking would have to be done if it were
1 implemented [laughter].
0 B:  Right.  Uh, there's any number of things that the government's involved 
0 A:  on a volunteer basis.  
0 A:  Yeah, well, listen, it was good talking with you.
0 B:  Okay, um, too high, obviously. 
0 and the City of Providence, uh, public works departments.
1 drinking, or,
0 A:  Yeah.  Um. 
0 A:  Yeah.  Around fifty percent?
0 worst, maybe the fourth worst school district in the, in the, in the state,
0 other than the city of Baltimore itself, probably, you know, which is always,
0 taxes, for my, my, my, uh, state taxes that go to my school district and my
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yep. 
0 B:  They had, uh, the best of equipment and, and the best of training.  A-, and
0 A:  But, you know, if we don't cut some of these nationwide, you know, some of
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 mechanized infa-, it's like the, it's like the old days when they had the
0 B:  Yep. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  -- uh, you would put a lot of people out of work.  But those people you put
0 B:  -- where they make the subs. 
1 A:  Yeah, that's pretty out there.  What, well,
0 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].
1 B:  But we don't farm.
1 A:  -- I can hear the accent now I hear the [laughter],
1 A:  I hear the Western Pennsylvania, um.
0 B:  Yeah, my brother has a home there he's trying to sell.  He, he's living now
0 up, uh, in, in Maryland but, uh, he,
0 A:  -- you know, in terms of, and in terms of housing down here, um, you really
1 A:  -- and, and I just have no tolerance for that.
1 A:  How far, where is Clarion County in relation to, actually, because we're
0 B:  And yeah, and it's, it's really not, you know, not that far.
0 B:  No, no.
0 A:  Yeah, I think that that's, um, I can remember in Pittsburgh when, this has
1 B:  Uh, yeah, we're tired of doing it though.  We, we don't want to do too much
1 more [laughter].
1 B:  We have a bath upstairs, and one, two, three, four bedrooms and a sewing
1 B:  it's, we just like it real well and,
1 A:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  Yeah, it is, I mean, I would never buy it but leasing it is fine.
0 working farm near Dayt-,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  -- it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins.
1 [laughter].
0 it's own.
0 A:  What part, what sections are they in?
0 A:  Yeah, that's nice.
0 They didn't have to do much to it.
0 A:  Great.
0 B:  -- bought what they could afford.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- on their investment very soon.  Um, but it's a beautiful home and,
0 B:  It is, it's real nice.
0 A:  -- you know.  It's, uh, when you come to this part of the country, we've
1 B:  Oh, my you wou-, you do when you mo-.  When we first got married, uh, my
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  that suddenly wasn't necessary any more [laughter].
1 happens is, uh, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next
0 B:  Right, yeah, you have to stop some place, yeah.
0 a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no
1 block in Pittsburgh or something.
1 A:  but it's still, it's still not that private.
0 B:  And I do get tired of that but, uh, I don't know, I don't think I'd want
0 to change it.
1 B:  uh, that helps [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.
1 while you can.
0 B:  Right.
1 with it any longer.
0 B:  Oh, okay.  That'll be nice.
0 interior to where the back seat itself can either be removed or laid, lain
1 A:  [Throat_clearing]. 
1 B:  Yeah, it's a neat little, um, it's, it's, it's, it's sort of like being a
0 B:  Forty thousand, yeah, that's just,
0 B:  Oh, yeah, this, this is nothing.  I mean, he, uh, he was showing me, they
0 {Woman's voice in background}.
0 A:  And we, we anticipate on keeping that car for hopefully another five, six,
0 A:  Well, Volvos, uh, there's a lot of them that we, in fact we have a mutual
0 friend, uh, my wife and I, that, uh, they, uh, they just passed three hundred
0 B:  And the car's probably still fine, right?
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.  And, uh, the, the only other thing is, you know, the, the pickup
0 get something that we can haul stuff in, if we have to [hum] --
1 it for a while.
0 that's probably a pretty good car.  [sniffing] [throat_clearing] [squeak].
1 it's a funny coincidence that m-, my cousin sold me the car.  And she's up for
1 the weekend now, [laughter] so she's out baby-sitting in the next room.
0 they went through everything.  I told them to put a shot of Freon in, and
0 A:  Oh, Ferenza.
0 put salt on the roads.
1 B:  Yeah, actually, we're, we're looking forward to getting out of here.
1 describe it.
1 A:  [Laughter]  Good deal.
1 just can't stand, top forty music.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Is it music that, um, like you can understand the words to?
0 music.  Do you know what I mean?
1 A:  -- I'm musically destitute.
0 crowd of little kids.
0 for an hour just to get out of the parking lot.
1 much trouble, um,
1 B:  Who won't get you into too much trouble [laughter]?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  That's crazy.
0 I still go back to the old faithfuls like James Taylor and, if I c-, if I had
0 or just, uh, put on a tape of, I don't know, Carly Simon or whatever, that's
1 in my car, but,
0 A:  -- crank it up because, I'm, 
0 B:  Do you really?
1 way to really destroy a C D is to drill a hole through it.
1 B:  Yeah, right, and I'll have to turn on my James Taylor tape or something
1 [laughter].
0 B:  All righty.  Take care.
0 idea.
1 B:  But I think if the entire trial was left to one person [child_crying]
1 um.
0 doesn't, one person thinks that, that they're not guilty and they can't decide
0 B:  Does it have to be unanimous?
0 B:  No, me neither.  
0 B:  Well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty, it's just if
1 B:  But, but, um, [throat_clearing] I don't know, I just hope if I ever go to
0 B:  Yeah, beca-,
1 B:  Tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we'll be able to, or
1 A:  Oh yeah, I vote, yes. 
0 times they don't, as well.
0 B:  Right they, sit on the fence, so.  Well, oh, I talked about this the other
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 out, he was in prison for, um, sexually assaulting two children.
0 B:  if you sentence them to three life times, then they probably won't get
1 B:  Well, it's supposed to be a jury of your peers, they couldn't have a, a
0 least have a, have a, have a bunch of psychiatrists, 
0 I would like, uh, I think, the, you know, with a goal and a purpose in mind of
0 A:  #That's# the problem is when you, when you, you know, you take it away
0 B:  that would, um, b-, be able to find a way to get the guns, but I think in a
0 were gun controls and that, there just were not guns accessible to that type of
0 A:  Yeah, I think, you know, if it, when it came down to these, uh, what I,
0 A:  #And, uh,# you know, with my wife and daughter.
0 A:  But, but, I think there are certain cases where it could get you in
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  #That's all right.#
0 A:  #I assure you, it, it can, it can and, and the chances,#
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  #because# they're behind bars now but,
0 that,
0 A:   I can tell you from, you know, just statistics and, 
0 A:   committed against them.  Now, it's one out of every four or five for
0 B:  No, I, I don't know.
0 B:  Oh, that they can't #do behind,# 
0 involved in, wa-, was there, were there guns involved in that.
0 A:  And, and knowing the guy and his record,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 you know, a couple times.
0 this, this new, you know, uh ... 
0 A:  #I, and I, I hate to say that# but,
0 A:  #'Cause# not everybody's capable of own, of owning and, and #taking care of
0 happen or whatever.  And, and, and frankly, just reporting them.  A lot of
0 should.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  when you consider, uh,
0 e-, who's an elementary school teacher,
0 B:  they, my wife teaches, uh, middle school.
0 B:  yeah, by the time they get there, they can't read.  The-, they, they can't
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 school.  I was f-, I w-, I didn't have that much money but we struggled and
0 B:  But you know, surprisingly, I, I, because you put such a commitment on
0 A:  parental involvement has to be there.
0 emphasis on sports, where enormous amounts of money are spent, and it seems to
0 realistically, a lot of the, was, uh, was probably, two-thirds, I guess it's
1 now two-thirds of what it was when they were national champions.
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Because when Georgetown #was number one,#
0 A:  I didn't realize that.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 at distance, Spitz, as a swimmer, you know, at,
0 that myself,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Huh.  #And that# --
0 B:  I think, uh, in, in some sense, um, [lipsmack] what I would do before I
1 continue the agony,
1 a,
1 are you in?
1 B:  [Talking] Oh, boy, this is going to be tough, I'm in Plano [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, north Dallas.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 really only five below.
1 A:  Um, no, there have been times, though, when it gets so frigid that you
1 [laughter],
0 B:  I'm very familiar, my grandparents and all my relatives are from
1 interesting, uh, the people down here typically don't think it gets above, you
1 know, fifty degrees [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter]  This is very true.
1 all the stuff I don't like, um,
0 A:  Isn't that strange?
0 w-, it was, it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the
0 A:  #Okay.#
0 A:  Yeah.
1 have various kinds of vermin running around, and --
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  -- and they have sites around in the community to, the grocery stores are
0 huge trash bins, but there may be some unsightly [barking] creatures running
0 B:  Yeah.
0 that government ought to do.  I can think of a lot of things that they
0 citizen in the country.
0 B:  Right.
0 in and, uh, take a little more charge.  And what's really good is, um, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Hey I bet you didn't think you were going to get a lecture on it
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Well, I was talking about like motor oil.
0 B:  Yes, I, I, I, I would be committed to that, becau-,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Well I,
0 B:  Oh, absolutely that, the choice would be yours --
1 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I guess that's, that's primarily was one of my thoughts,
0 A:  For them to have a choice on --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 program like that.  Um, I wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh.
0 A:  Uh, cause that's the first I've really known anybody that, you know, works
0 for somebody that they had that option, you know, to make the choice --
1 B:  I'm, I'm very thankful that I'm not [laughter] under any doctor's care
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Oh [laughter].  If you have your health, you're wealthy.
1 A:  Uh, are you familiar with any of the area that all?
1 B:  Well, I have a brother that lives there [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, well that's, that's a ways away.  But we live in Clarion County.
0 B:  Okay, so, I'm a former Michiganian so, 
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh -- 
0 A:  So, uh, we've been pretty fortunate.  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  So, uh, it rea-,
1 A:  Well, they say second hand smoke and that, is worse than smoking
1 B:  -- to their little room that they want to,
1 the country.
0 B:  Um. 
1 A:  Right. 
0 nowhere by the lake.  And we had a ball.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  -- and we broke that out of there and put it over our, um, hole. 
0 B:  Oh, that's a good idea. 
0 A:  Yeah, we're still waiting to go again. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Arkansas. 
0 B:  Beautiful, beautiful country. 
0 B:  -- and we had a two bedroom mobile home there, but the boys still liked to
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  I used a tire chain and the bottom of a Dutch oven. 
1 A:  Well, I'm impressed [laughter]. 
0 grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and there wasn't, I don't know, but we just
1 B:  Well, if our time is up we can quit. 
0 B:  Okay.  Uh-huh. 
0 married, so --
0 have a daughter whose twenty, and we spend a lot of time
0 A:   But, uh, yeah, it's a, I don't, I, I c-, I, one thing that happened is
0 when, when my son, uh, graduated from high school, and he went off to
1 friends who are single parents, and I just don't know how people
0 that I, I quit, and I've been able to stay home.  And, um, ...
1 B:   No, I don't work, yeah.  So I one of those few old-fashioned
0 B:   And I did the same thing with Taylor, uh,
1 herself and feel like she could, she could do it, you know.
0 and I think about how much, how much time I devoted to my
0 B:   Oh, I'm sure.
0 A:   -- being a kid with them and getting to do all the fun
1 bad about looking ahead and thinking, Oh, I don't ever want them
0 that kind of thing.  But at least I'm really making the most of
0 B:   Uh-huh.
0 maybe children who have that everyday don't, don't, don't
0 appreciate it as much as, you know --
0 B:   Uh-huh.
1 B:   Yeah.
1 A:   That's great, I wish I could stay home now. [laughter]
0 B:   [laughter]  Well, I feel, I feel really thankful that I can. 
1 because I feel like we'll have plenty of time to get us a nice
0 B:   Well, it's interesting.  We're real involved with a church
1 work, they just want to, they like to get out and they don't want to
1 get on that topic, I have to be real careful because --
1 A:   [laughter]
0 A:   -- you know, even if your, uh, kids all the way through high
0 school and then it doesn't mean you have to go back to work.
0 A:   So ...
1 it.  [laughter]
0 B:   When I did my, uh, student teaching, I, oh, I hated it.  I
0 B:   Yeah.
1 B:   Yeah, I, and you just don't feel like being around all these
0 B:   And, uh, thanks for calling.
1 B:  Well I, I certainly hope so.  We have a, a classic ranch, up in Denton.
0 go down the street I can just pick out houses that are, that are identical to
0 thing, my house is a little bit different and I can pick it out again because
0 cathedral ceilings in, uh, two rooms.  In the, uh, family room and in the
0 master bedroom and those are, are pleasant.
1 not going up there [laughter].
1 ambitious and an-, get angry I'll start poking holes up there, but until that
0 it's one story and they're all basically two, uh, bath, two, uh, with three
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  But it's, it's basically all brick.  The next subdivision over from me is
0 basically almost all three, two.  They're all three, two.  But of course they
1 have a little river going down their area too, which is kind of nice
1 inches of water.
1 have been real disappointed in the six years that I've lived out here about
1 A:  I know, I was, 
1 other, but, uh, to me their not that big enough for a pool, but, you know,
0 take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of
1 seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city.
1 B:  You all both, you all both work downtown?
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  We have to work a certain number of hours and then we get holiday pay and
0 vacation pay and, they, if you,
0 B:  Uh-huh, oka-, 
1 A:  #then you don't get the benefits.#  Yeah, yeah, you don't get anything at
1 all [laughter].
0 of a profit sharing, or, you know, or just, you know,
0 A:  I guess that's good, I don't know, uh, I can't decide.
0 are very, very low and anything that is elective of, in any way, could
0 B:  That's right, that's right.
0 B:  And I know that that is a, is a concern and if those people aren't willing
0 A:  Yeah, do you, uh, does your husband's company have any of the new, like
0 B:  and that kind of thing, so.
0 B:  Yeah, we have been so grateful for that over the years, because, we, uh,
0 B:  No, I don't think so.  I think there are going to be too many of us our age
0 luck and are very happy, you know, if I, if I  had to, [child_yelling] {in the
1 those payments.
0 A:  Um, they had some flooding in Houston the other day, real, real bad --
0 A:  [Noise] {pans rattling}.
0 A:  that's right.
0 B:  it seems like, uh, you know, the weather pattern is just shifting, and,
0 It's, um, I'd say it's at least seventy-nine, eighty, well, about
1 B:  Um.  Well, we've had some, you know, pretty, pretty rough winds.  Oh, uh,
1 and so the, the beaches here just get really beat up {pause} and it usually
0 comes this way [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Huh.
0 B:  Oh, did it?
0 A:  Yeah --
1 A:  -- you can really see them well there.
0 B:  -- and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground.  But otherwise
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 vegetable garden, and I'm from Chicago, and the way that, uh, bugs and weeds
1 heat all Summer, and we just kind of, uh, decided to go with a few flowers and
0 to eat that stuff.
1 now, and the trees.
0 B:  Um.
1 B:  Really.  Gosh.
0 A:  But, and my garden, you know, [laughter] my tomatoes are two and a half
1 freeze.
1 B:  If you don't have a frost you'll be all right [laughter].
1 B:  That's what I remember from living up north, is that you'd get everything
1 B:  Oh, yeah, my husband does that, thank goodness, because I, that's not a
1 pleasure for me [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the m-, the mowing.
0 B:  I love gardens that are well tended, and I just, there's been a few
1 B:  So I do admire that, but I haven't really put, uh, too much energy into it.
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  So that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and
1 laundry, I'll tell you [laughter].
1 have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison, which is good, because
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 how long it gets out here.
1 real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week,
1 B:  It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives, so
1 A:  Well, I would a-, assume, too, I mean, you've got three or four months
0 A:  -- of, of bad weather.
1 B:  We always had gardens when I was, uh, living in Chicago.  In fact, my
1 mother once tore up our entire back yard [laughter],
1 waterfall and a little pond in one corner.  I mean, that was like the most
1 remodeled the entire back yard.  Then they sold the house and got divorced, so
1 I don't know what that says about it all [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] Oh, dear.
1 B:  Yeah, yeah.
1 A:  Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, yes [laughter].  They're both running around now.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off, and the flower
1 colors for me to play with?
1 A:  Right.  Maybe next year they'll do better.
0 bases.
0 B:  which is right, you know, right close by.
1 be closed, you know.
0 spending.
0 overhauls until they're the ones, you know, until it's the one that, that I
0 sponsored or the one that my state gets the most benefit from, or, you know,
0 B:  [Cough].
0 to force us to do it anyway.
0 you know.  
0 of a colloquium, just use common sense, but i-, it just seems like there has
1 B:  You know, I, I think that, uh, you know, I think we're just going to have
0 even find myself, you know, I see, I, I play that game with myself sometimes,
0 insane and,
0 B:  Yeah, yo-, and I, I guess that's the, the problem or, you know, th-, as I
1 individuals would do, and that's, you know,
0 to spend more than you continue to, uh, sell, as long as you continue to buy,
1 Gulf War, uh, that we have received, uh, at least sixty percent of the money
0 remember some, I, I just don't, I haven't seen a real accounting of that.
0 occurrences are.
1 A:  Um, that's a point.
0 B:  ye-, if you absolutely [breathing] [laughter].
0 Some people ask you for it, but you're not required to give that information.
0 so-, even our driver's license numbers are printed on there,
0 financial background, your educational background.  Uh, one of the biggest
0 B:  Uh-huh, did you, have you registered for a conference recently?
0 you confirmation of your registration or your hotel or something like that.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 license plate number and he called a friend in motor vehicles and got her
1 the credit bureau and he got her financial standing, okay.
0 B:  Or getting junk mail from a list that had to have been made years ago.
1 get it so,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 worthwhile.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  So that will limit that amount of stuff.
0 B:  That's great.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Because now they have to pay the postage, so now it's costing them
1 A:  to use a credit card.
1 maybe it will catch up, up here.
0 B:  Although some of them have a blank on there for it, they don't generally
1 A:  -- we've got the ones you just stick your card in the pump.
0 A:  -- you put the nozzle back and it says do you want a receipt and if you
0 A:  Huh.
0 A:  Huh.  What do you think of that, uh, the greenhouse effect that's going on?
0 B:  Well I guess that's fluoro-, the fluorocarbons --
0 B:  -- and, uh,
0 effects of the weather from, uh, uh, the shift in the jet stream.
1 Kentucky, I should know but,
1 don't have snow, they don't know what snow is.  They freak out when there's
1 snow on the ground [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, really?
1 just something that goes with the territory.
1 rain, I, I swear they close everything down.  I just laugh.
1 they have snow,
1 A:  on the ground everything's closed up.  And you know, you can have snow
1 on the ground and not be slick on the road [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] That's true.  
0 A:  -- and there is a few factories, but I don't see much pollution going on.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  Well, you know what they've started doing is, is instead of the tail pipes
0 going to --
0 A:  -- along the highway.
0 oxygen, and it'll, you know, pass out,
0 A:  But, no it would seem like it would be the same way in, on the California
0 A:  I think they do that for most everybody.
1 A:  -- older old people.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Well.
1 A:  I got, I, I've got one vice and smoke is, smoking is it.
0 A:  Boston, Massachusetts [laughter].  
1 all.  From up north, like you said, I think one was from Boston.
1 A:  With Boston, I love their accent [laughter].
0 of, uh, trying to break every rototiller that we ever rented, um, we've just
0 A:  -- and then worked and worked and worked with the soil.  I mean bag after
0 A:  Oh.
0 A:  -- that's where the bugs come from [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, oh those,
0 B:  Yeah, but, uh, 
1 okra, and I, I picked okra,
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Uh, right, yeah, we're going to just have a ground, you know, put ground
1 volunteer to come back every year --
1 Right, so yeah.
0 A:  Right, that's true [laughter].
0 B:  It has, uh, of course, during the early spring, it has the red, you know,
0 out.  So there's a little bit of clean up work for that.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, always it's, uh,
0 winds which are predominant, you know, during the growing season, make both of
0 A:  Yeah, I know that, um, we've done some other things with the grass and
0 out, they stuck in, um, wh-, what is that, Saint Augustine stuff.
1 by plugs, you know --
0 stuff I'd thrown out.  So, we're trying to, um, a-, after this winter, we had
0 then the grub worms come out in the larva stage and they eat the grass off at
1 A:  You're not?
0 B:  -- doesn't require it, really.  
0 A:  -- and I do exercise.  Uh, lately I've been off of it because I've had
0 shoulder problems, but, uh, that seems to be on the mend, and I think I'm
1 evening and I had a dog at that time, and I walked him, and I kind of lost
1 for a day or so, and then, you know, I could lose, you know, five pounds.  Now
1 I'd have to do that for two solid [laughter] weeks before I'd lose five pounds.
0 maintains his weight now, because he jogs like, uh, nine miles a day.
1 B:  #Yeah#, and he gets that adrenalin high, and I guess that really, I've never
0 B:  Well, I think the way you're talking now that you're already motivated for
1 that goal.
1 A:  [laughter]
1 A:  Uh, I'm, I'm slowly growing out of my wardrobe, 
1 A:  so I have no choice.  I can't afford a new one.  So.
1 B:  Okay.  [laughter]
0 A:  [laughter] But, uh, but it's, it's something I've done pretty much all my
0 A:  and I see them eat, and then I'm, of course I'm impelled also, 
0 problem with, is I tend to like food way too much.  And, uh, back when, back
0 satisfaction out of eating, you know, because you socialize and you're
0 maintaining your, your body, uh, you're, you're maintaining all of your, uh,
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  [laughter] But, uh, I've got to get on the wagon, and I know it.
0 B:  marvelous health clubs too that, you know, you can use their facilities.
0 A:  Yeah, we, in fact we've got several of them, uh, you know, within just a
1 B:  Well, that's fine. I think we covered quite a bit.
1 A:  [laughter]  
1 B:  [Talking] [noise] {in background} [breathing] Well, depends on the day,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- so it just depends on the mood I'm in and where I'm going, you know.  If
1 A:  I never wear a sport coat.  That's ridiculous.  But then,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  And not too dressy, like, you know, after five stuff.  I've nev-, 
0 B:  And, uh, the women, you see, you have, you can't wear halters or nothing
1 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 could wear whenever I got ready, but you had to wear that uniform to work, and
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  I wouldn't mind having a uniform.  People think I'm crazy but,
0 B:  So it, it's supplied --
1 going to just give them to you.
1 A:  [Laughter] That's (( )),
0 B:  -- or maintenance crew and the truck drivers --
0 A:  #Right, uh-huh.#
1 A:  Yeah --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Right, 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  No matter.
0 B:  And seems like it kicks in extra hard.
0 A:  -- and jeez, if it wasn't the --
0 the men would be in competition.
1 A:  Yeah. 
1 B:  then you guys couldn't work [laughter] [noise] {high pitch tone}.
1 shorts, and they're, they're a nice material, nice checkered, plaid material
1 A:  So, it's like, well, they're fine for her, but, uh, you know, they're just
0 A:  -- but I was just crossing through to get my mail #and stuff.#
1 B:  -- so he's got different outfits.  
1 golf course wears them colors.
0 A:  Just when they go to play golf they wear those funny clothes.  That's true.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- I mean, yeah, I guess so, because some people do get wild with their
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  -- you know, with these haircuts now [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  He can, I can only let him fade it a little bit.  I tell him he's got to
1 around with nine hundred ninety nine parts in your head,
1 B:  Uh-huh.  You're not going no where with me, he's not.
1 B:  I told him, No, no, huh-uh, we can't have that.
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  I'm not one of them liberated parents, I guess, I don't know.
1 A:  You know, and other than calling him Tex, he barely talked to him because
1 Texas.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 Well Sam, if he wears cowboys that gives him another inch and it just may 
1 B:  I'm fairly full of it, of it myself.
0 general, uh, to give me time to make up my mind.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Well, that must be helpful.
1 B:  a lot of fun, at the moment.
0 Or they can,
0 B:  And, yes, that'll add one year to his education experience.
0 language processing, and, and, and at least one person who's in my field
1 to, and got to make one rule.
0 courses that you could take, but they all centered, they all came out of
1 some of the more fun classes, I guess (( )).  I feel a little more worldly
0 now [laughter].
0 and I'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder, because, uh, I just
0 undergraduate degree.  And then fifteen years after that, I got the first of a
0 A:  Oh, wow.
0 B:  -- with those kids that are there.  
0 B:  -- you know, type situation where that housekeeper, someone in the home,
1 wouldn't be going to work --
0 B:  -- except for the person who's got a career, you know --
0 B:  I think we're going to see a lot more, um, paternity leave and options that
0 A:  -- #even# a corporate contribution.  I mean --
0 A:  -- just companies helping to, to pay for it, because it's just not, #i-,
0 B:  #Well, basically,# you know, we already have.  My husband works for a
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  And so, you know, even though she's only working part-time, she's not
0 A:  Isn't that ideal.
1 B:  And the, uh, of course, you always wonder, you know, when you read it in
0 A:  Right [laughter].  Is this true, or what?
0 the team members that were interviewed all seemed to be very supportive of
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Wow that's amazing.
1 A:  I would imagine that must be hard to, to not bring your work home
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  Our, uh, our dentists are husband and wife team, 
0 A:  Well, that's, that's good, I mean --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- and, uh, we are, we're to the point now where we only have one that has
0 you want any s-, sort of credit, 
0 simply, I, I do t-, I do feel it is but I don't know whether,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  some of the questions they ask are legitimate --
1 A:  -- uh, because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your
0 B:  They showed a reporter and a, um, and a copy editor how they went out and
0 uh, like we just moved here from, uh, Minneapolis and, uh, to get the, the
0 B:  in for an adoption, and I mean after we gave our fingerprints n-, to the 
0 F B I, you, you,
1 B:  look at each other, yeah, you look at each other and say, well,
0 when I finish a, a certain flight on a random basis I have to,

1 B:  um, it's no better than journalism [laughter].
0 they've been arresting people like that.
0 A:  Well, I mean, I don't understand, 
0 (( )),
1 A:  Oh, they do?
0 A:  Well there's, there's all sorts of scare tactics, I guess, to, to invade
0 our privacy and,
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  I mean the old, uh, I'm old enough now where George Orwell, uh, way past
0 A:  is come an-, is come and gone but it's here.
1 B:  Ho-, was it a big change in your life, to, uh --
0 A:  I'm a nurse.

1 I know there are some days when she wi-, 
1 B:  -- she wishes she was back at work.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, well t-, see that's, that's why I'm glad my wife did too, 'cause she
0 B:  Um, uh, I'm in Dallas, Texas.
0 A:  Oh, yea-,.
0 the weekends together, the family,
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and try to fill our day with things like that, but, um.
1 B:  it's so much easier to go to mom, I guess they get used to it.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh, it really does because I think yu-, you know, you grow closer.
1 A:  And, and the cost of living here is just so tremendously, you know,
1 A:  Yeah, yeah, at least, I, I just consider myself blessed that I can stay
1 days when, uh, I come home and she says here take these kids, I'm getting out.
0 B:  But, for the most part, I, you know, I've really feel like that's led,
0 A:  No, I didn't, I didn't even really think about it that much, I mean, you
0 a child.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 and it has not,
0 B:  -- it is very warm here, which is typical for this part of the, time of the
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  Early June.  
1 B:  we do not have that problem [laughter].  
1 B:  we will be glad, I will be glad to give you some of ours [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
1 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  They get burnt off. 
1 B:  Yeah.  Well, my parents are now in San Diego, and, and they've got pebbles
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 makes a, a bit of a difference, too.
0 A:  Uh.  
0 don't know.
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
1 A:  We are fortunate or, uh, we are on a, where we are we get flooded, it
0 A:  It is nice down there.  I, I, I liked it when we visited there.
1 me in the wintertime down there.
1 B:  Oh, sure.  I mean [laughter], 
1 A:  Oh.  
1 B:  And she went back to the north of England with a sunburn [laughter].
1 A:  Oh, good heavens [laughter].  Not me [laughter].  I avoid the sun
1 A:  Yeah, it takes me about four and a half hours to do, to mow our grass.  And
1 A:  I, I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier.
0 B:  Yes, uh, that sounds like a good, that sounds like the right theory.
0 want them to have --
1 them.  And,
1 been real interesting. So I hope you enjoy it as much as I have been enjoying
0 it [laughter].
1 B:  -- of days. 
0 B:  Uh, I never pay interest charges.  I value my money too much to, uh, line
1 A:  That is wonderful,   
0 have enough in savings s-, you know, like for a big purchase.
0 A:  Then, uh, sometimes I, I, uh, lose sight of it, you know, it is, it ju-, it
0 A:  just to pay them all off.  And then I swore I would never use them again.
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Uh-huh.  The only thing is, you have to make sure that you don't charge
0 A:  Uh-huh.  I have a, I have a friend who, uh, well, she is old enough to know
1 B:  -- Neiman Marcus and things like that.  And I am sure that they probably
1 Palley Royal.  So, you know, they, it is just ha-, you know, you got stay
0 B:  Well, self-con-,    
1 A:  -- in their -- 
0 A:  they gave each other these beautiful things.  They gave --
0 A:  uh, in fact I know of a man who is in, uh, he is in a, he, he, he, he
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 touch you.  And you have got to live that down.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  That is true.  That is really true. 
0 really is a lifesaver at times when you do have to use it.  But, but like you
1 to pay it off every, every month.  So that is, that is something about
0 B:  -- that they were going to do  -- 
0 can only, uh, be responsible for a certain percent and not the full, uh,
0 amount that they owed.
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
1 B:  I can't think of anything right now. 
1 A:  (( )) [laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  so I do not have a whole lot of spare time right now.
0 B:  And then I, I really enjoy sewing, but I do not get much of a chance to
1 B:  Yeah.  That is neat. 
0 B:  Well, since I have had kids, it is kind of funny.  I, I never really was
0 after your children get bigger, uh, like when they want things like tricycles,
1 B:  So, I am, I have become a garage sale shopper.
1 And I found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class.
0 A:  -- at a lot of places.  
1 is something I have decided I am going to make sure my kids have a, have a
0 your time around like that.  But,
0 B:  But I think, my husband is real into sports too. He plays on a T I softball
1 team and the church softball team.  And by the time he plays two games a week
0 B:  We have never done that before, but the kids are always wanting to play in
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Oh, no.  
1 B:  And, uh, we have had to start all over trying to plant grass.  So it has
1 A:  Oh, well, we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it
0 A:  -- mowing every week, and finding time --
0 A:  Seems like sometimes hobbies do that.  They kind of take over and turn into
1 doing.  It is funny though, it is like I do not really want to cook for us
1 A:  Yeah.  Your,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 been a couple of times, and, uh, just getting to be outside, you know, all the
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  -- I think it will be real good for them [laughter].
0 B:  They can go fishing.  
0 A:  And they think they are really great fishermen --
1 B:  Yeah, yeah.  
1 A:  Oh.
1 school, I made a blanket. And, but you know, I can't even remember how I did
1 it now [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, yeah.
1 A:  And then I tore it out and threw it down. [laughter] And I never have,
1 A:  picked it back up again, and now I can't remember anything about it
1 not realize how long it took.  And I got about two, two-thirds of it done,
1 B:  and then I just, I had the baby [laughter].  
1 B:  Uh, uh, people do not do that much any more. So, it was something easy I
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  # Yeah.  I was, #
0 B:  We could not, we could not get it together to drive.  I mean, you know, we
0 Earth Day.
0 A:  # growing up # with, [child_talking]  when I grew up, it just was not, we

0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 mama."  And he said, "Well," he said, "does that mean you are going to shoot
0 A:  you know, butcher them if they get fat?" He said, "My kids are my
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  bless his heart, you know [laughter]. 
1 bottoms but,
1 B:  -- going to be back in style any day now. 
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  But, uh, my husband is not a conformist at all [laughter]. 
0 talking about the rain forests. 
0 generations is what to do with the children.  Because both mother and father
0 better had Mom been able to stay home with us. 
0 B:  But my, my, uh, friends are having babies right and left, so I get to see
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah.  But, uh, [child_talking]. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Well, see and, and that is, uh, the sort of the thing of the nineties is --
0 B:  -- women --
0 A:  And he is just now, well, when I got pregnant, I went ahead and quit work
1 what I mean?
1 B:  -- on to you." 
0 B:  # and, # you know, just being very, very politically astute about how to
0 B:  Because,
1 B:  I sort of think of a reunion with my, uh, all the extended family
0 [laughter].
0 everybody organized.  Uh, is there someone, do you all just sort of chip in
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah.  That to me is, yeah, Dallas I know of, Houston I know of, and that
0 A:  [Cough].  
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property, but we
1 A:  it is, uh, it is, uh, eighty acres.  
1 B:  I do not know how they do scale down there.  You know, here it would be a
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  
0 A:  And, uh,
0 B:  -- tens of acres.
0 too. But the bass, we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet.
0 So,
0 B:  And, uh, somebody suggested to get a bass.  
1 B:  And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in
0 bait --
0 A:  -- and  up into Canada.
1 he came out, and the trap was gone.
0 A:  Uh [laughter].  
1 B:  And it was a raccoon that had taken it.  
0 where the trap, the trap was dragged and things like that.
1 B:  And so, 
0 the museum.
0 B:  That is pretty big though.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 been a male or in Israel, I would have been number two.
1 B:  Really?  [Child_talking].
1 B:  Wowie!  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- L B J and --  
0 would think, [sigh] you know, just, uh, how could the government or the
1 A:  You know, and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields
0 A:  Yeah.  I mean I do not think they do. But I just think it is kind of a
0 shame that, uh, you still hear things about the children that are orphans
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  [Laughter].  
0 that they went or, or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one.
0 B:  You know,
0 A:  And that, that, 
0 A:  Yeah.  The bitterness is more on a personal --  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  So it really, I mean, because I know, in nineteen sixty-three, I mean I was
1 A:  You know, and you think to yourself, oh, my goodness, Eisenhower
0 that, they are just kind of bitter, you know.  They, they, you know, I hate to
1 B:  Okay.  
0 A:  That is probably as about as much as we both know [laughter].  But thanks
0 the humidity is, uh, below forty percent, which makes it kind of like Phoenix.
0 B:  Little bit, little bit cooler, like eighty-nine.
1 B:  But, basically the same thing.
0 Uh, we're probably making a comparison against, uh, some
0 A:  Uh, so, uh, one of the reasons, uh, that, uh, o-,
1 A:  #People are# always mo-, you know, one out of every
0 NINETEEN EIGHTY-EIGHT.  
1 the other #books were#,
0 uh, uh, th-, th-, there was, uh, BLUE SMOKE AND MIRRORS was
0 the one in eighty-two.  Uh, they, these guys, uh, have
0 that either.  I, #I, I guess I#    
0 A:  And, and, and it ... 
0 A:  Is it working?  I mean that's, that's the 
0 A:  -- #disappointed#, but they don't throw the rascal
0 their income tax or property tax or whatever.  
1 because I am sure that any time money and votes are
0 anything specific these days.  But whatever you are
0 B:  #Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.#
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 liberty and all that.  I think voters are #motivated, 
0 where they have higher turnouts?   And, well, the newer
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 their vote does not count any way.
0 of our population, uh, mainly the blacks in the south
0 B:  #Yeah#.
0 of a vote out to, to pass their plan.  And this is
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh, I think that that's probably true.
0 A:  But for how many years?
0 A:  Oh, that's great.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  No, I agree, a hundred percent, a hundred percent.  I guess I was
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  -- you know, nobody seemed to have a big problem with that [laughter].  So.
1 B:  Um, goodness, what else?
0 guess I'm being, you know, beyond the age of thinking of this, this problem.
0 certainly financially --
0 every day, and out to lunch every day,
0 B:  You're probably right.  If she sat down and looked at it she'd be like,
0 God, what am I doing this for, you know.
0 they have relatives and, you know, the husband would certainly like a lot more
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 what all that really means now.
0 somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer, and in the past, maybe the
1 guess we've sort of run dry a little bit.
1 B:  Okay [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] It was nice talking to you.
0 A:  Okay.  Bye-bye.
0 Because the families then seem to neglect visiting them.  But if that is the
0 A:  He's always lived in the, in the city, and he's always been kind of
1 license, you know he's always,
0 A:  -- he, uh, he still didn't want to give up his apartment --
0 call him and he wouldn't answer the phone.  So we kind of expected the worse.
0 A:  Um, I was working during the day, and, and, uh, my wife couldn't, she, she
0 A:  -- and they took care of him, you know, and he slowly deteriorated, and uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  You get them in, you do what you have to do for them, and that's it.
0 him --
0 and she'd go in and feed him, and, and it got to the point where, um, they, we
0 A:  -- Uh, but most of the people were,
0 B:  Sure.
0 B:  Right.
1 A:  But he was young enough where they gave him therapy, and he was beginning
1 B:  So he kind o-,
0 my father-in-law --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  I think I'll walk off into the mountains somewhere, or out into the,
1 B:  Like the old Indian people used to do [laughter],
0 B:  Okay.  How did it influence them?
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 those problems?
0 my life."  Much like what Roger Staubach did.
0 B:  Right.  And, but, uh, most of the folks that I have met that were actually
0 A:  But what they do afterwards and how they re-, rehabilitate you.
0 A:  and all they did is run and hide.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  You know, and there is no way that they could ever catch them.
0 B:  Well, I think the terrain had a lot to do with the, the success of Desert
1 A:  Yeah,  
0 B:  -- dune [laughter].  
0 they had to, you know, they had to blow them up or,
0 B:  What world war do you think they found the experience for that?
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Right.  
0 A:  Your kids.  How many kids do you have?
1 A:  Oh, goodness.
1 B:  Well, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 problems that their kids get into, are, are good to, uh, show that they do
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Um, yes.  
0 B:  I, I like, uh, how the, how he has to help with the people that he, that
0 B:  Uh, because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he
1 A:  It, but it is a not really a good baby sitter [laughter].
1 A:  You would see somebody get shot, they would just fall down.
0 A:  And,    
0 B:  Too much realism I think,
0 B:  -- like that one.
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  -- ideas.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  You mean in cable?
1 control.
0 for those movies because, now we have got a lot of western tapes.
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Oh, d-, [laughter],  
1 A:  -- kind of like my idol [laughter],  
0 B:  Yeah, I, and I liked that show because it, it portrayed, I thought, really
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Because there is not a lot of shows that do that.  [cough] And, uh, they
0 and he just, well, I even like Jot.  I mean I, it is funny.
0 B:  W-,    
1 Jot, and then he has got a friend named Cat.  And I think the dog is the only
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  We got him a little Jesus doll, uh, about a year ago, and he has always
0 cable,
0 A:  So it's a,  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 that was either, you know, uh, close to where I lived or close to where I
0 I know a lot of, uh, mothers or, uh, people that I work with and they are
1 A:  yeah, I, I do not have kids yet, uh,
0 A:  And my wife is planning on probably taking care of them at that point.  
0 B:  And I guess the ratio of, of workers to children, you know, would be
0 B:  So, basically I think that when they do that, that person really feels a
1 to be, I, I started to say stuck at home with children,
1 B:  all the time [laughter] {mimics dramatic voice}.  And never getting
0 a six year old son and a three month old son.
1 A:  So I am just sort of seeing what all the hassles are, you know of,
1 having children.  You know, maybe there is a lot of stu-, stuff, uh, that you
0 then they are, you know, I do not know, I, you know, y-, you can f-, you get a
0 feel from it too.  If your child is too small you cannot, but if y-, if they
0 like you say, I don't know if I would put a kid there who is less than, you
0 know, uh, four years old or something.
1 A:  Yeah.  I, if, it is just like I say, this is a very foreign topic for me,
0 class twice a week --
0 will do this, they will do that.  He keeps them moving quick enough that, you
0 the regular ones, you know, the normal kids, you can just let them go a little
0 bit.  And, and, and he sort of, he is real good at keeping them in line.  And
1 do some good stuff and beat up a lot of the little girls.  I mean,
0 A:  Uh, in some case, actually a lot of parents send their kids or just bring
0 card in, every, after every quarter or, or whenever they get their report
1 B:  [Cough].
0 A:  uh, is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real
1 trying to save the people from having to,
0 A:  I do not,
0 uh, procedures.  And the eighteen years will, uh, translate into something
0 uh,
1 B:  uh, I do not think I would either.
0 A:  Yes.
0 The benefit, I guess, of crime outweighs what the deterrent is.
0 mean the prison population, uh, as far as I, I, uh, you know, my impression of
0 things that could ever happen, uh, from what I read and see and understand.  I
0 B:  -- finding out what the, uh, percentage of drug related type things are,
0 bothers me is the ability, of course th-, it is a constitutional right that
0 they should not be asked, uh, before television cameras and newspaper
1 ability to ask that.  But I, I would think I, if I did anything, I would
0 B:  Well, I know, uh, on the other hand though, when, uh-, after the Barry
0 B:  as well as national.
1 A:  Yeah,  
0 B:  But --  
1 A:  no, but,
1 B:  -- guilty [laughter].
0 lousy job, or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented
1 A:  I think I am getting a call coming in.  
0 B:  if, if she gets it planned.  I have been out of town, so I do not know
0 uh, one of these, uh, days.
0 B:  Right.   
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  Sure, that makes a big crowd.   
0 and the old people cannot take it anymore.
0 A:  Now, the kids would sneak off.  And we were just being kids, [baby_talking]
1 B:  Uh-huh.    
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Yes, I remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it.  We were all
1 B:  Every family has all that going on, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Sure. 
1 B:  Oh, Lord.   
1 B:  Oh, I am telling you.  That is, uh,
1 A:  Uh, I won't be adding any more to the family reunion [laughter].
0 B:  Enjoyed talking to you.   
1 B:  Well, uh, I am probably, uh, closer to being a, what is it?  The ten is on
0 the individual the right to own firearms, for, you know, for their, whatever
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh (faintly).  
0 B:  And, uh, I think that there should be, uh, sufficient, uh, guns and, you
0 know, and ammunition and things available for that.
0 [throat_clearing] then just now, just this last year, it seems like he's, he
0 and buy a, uh, what, uh, uh, a good gun costs like two hundred to five hundred
0 a, uh, criminal or somebody with criminal intent, real criminal intent, wants
1 A:  Right.
0 B:  Uh, you know, af-, even with the waiting period.  And I, you know, I cannot
0 A:  Uh-huh.  That is right.  And a lot of times like, uh, what is his name?  I
0 B:  Yeah.  Whitman.
0 Harvey Os-, Oswald was sane when he bought his gun, you know.  But he bought
0 B:  But, uh, you know, so I, you know, I can see that there are, are reasons
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I do not either.  Yeah.  That is true.  Because, you know, once, once
0 know, they have every right to have a rifle and be able to, to hunt.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 injured, but not seriously apparently.  But, uh, you know, it was really
0 A:  with a gun.  And a, a lot of the stuff that he did, they did not
0 first started, he robbed the Safeway that my brother was working at, at the
0 B:  But then there is also, there is the, uh, what is his name?  Bernie Getz,
0 B:  Uh, you know, of course he was, his, the purpose of him having the gun was
0 A:  And held it on him for a couple of hours.
0 know, the, the Constitution says what kind of rights we have, and I do not, I
1 car and it, it didn't work, and it blew out all the fuses.
0 A:  No, he hooked it up right.  It, it was just that the, the part just, just
0 didn't fit the car, so.  I took it back and, uh, he, he took the alter-, the
0 So, uh, took it up there, towed it up there because it, you know, wouldn't
0 B:  Well I had a weird, there's a little sensing device, uh, in front of my,
0 metal piece that fits through the belts, uh, and somehow that broke off and,
0 piece obviously, um, I have a Subaru, and, uh, I think you can only get it
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, and I haven't had too many problems with my car, I got a eighty-eight
0 and I do not do my oil changes and I will not do my oil changes.  I've, I
0 A:  Uh-huh, well my car is, uh, it's an eighty-six and I really hadn't had
0 B:   four or five years?
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Do you work for T I? 
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh, there's a number that you call, it's the same number that you, that
0 A:  You, you call that number and, and, uh, somehow or another they'll give you
0 an option to leave a message and you can leave a message.
0 A:  I know someone that did that, you leave a message and they'll, they'll
0 this is the first time I've been called in a long time and I haven't been
1 B:  Well I don't know if I've done it quite that much, but, uh, mine is mixed
0 B:  Huh, oh well.
1 B:  Okay, normally I watch, uh, T V.
1 a lot of calls from, uh, the MORNING NEWS and the TIMES HERALD where they want
0 B:  Oh!  Okay, Sunday's usually my big one.
1 A:  Yeah, I get the Sunday paper because of the T V schedule.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 find out actually what's going on around here.
0 B:  Oh, it's same way here.
0 unless there are rumors a-, for pertaining to layoffs or company business,
0 we were all there, usually by seven thirty.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 usually it's, I just don't have the time.
0 percent abreast and watching, you know, reading the newspaper, and forget it.
1 newspaper suffers to watching T V, and T V is more entertaining, uh, it, uh,
0 reading them.
1 A:  Yeah, um,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 rest of it, I may pick it up and, uh, glance at it, but, uh, I usually don't
0 the world in itself.  How much they get, or how much, I talk to people that I
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  Yeah, I believe that's true.
0 before about, uh, the, say the network news coverage.  They only have so much
0 B:  I think they could use a little more of it a little bit wiser and put a
0 nature.
0 B:  Well that's too, true to a degree, if they can put a complete half hour T
0 know what I'm talking about.
0 because it does show, uh, what positive impact the police have in the society,
0 B:  See, so you wouldn't, see like that's a cop show, fine, but there's
0 positive in many different areas,
0 A:  So she made him go sleep upstairs.  
1 A:  Yeah.  And he sets up traps for them all over the house.
0 like, um, in the early eighties or the, during the, like the SMOKEY AND THE
1 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  Just more of the same.  
0 B:  Oh.  
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody.
1 hear that music, you know, everybody knows what you are talking about.
0 theatre because I did not know it was any good.
0 B:  Right.  Yeah.  I saw it then too.  
1 that I could have seen, you know.  Because my family tells me that, that, that
0 A:  Huh.
0 B:  You know, someone who, uh, who was a real activist but then took up the
0 B:  And, uh, has pretty much dropped out of public life.  But he is still alive
0 B:  So i-, it could easily have been patterned after him.  But the, the movie
0 @@B:  Sort of interesting, so.  Well, I guess we have talked probably our l-,
0 time limit, haven't we?
0 A:  Okay, what do you read?  [Child_talking].
0 A:  Oh.  
1 A:  I like to read stuff like that.  But I am a superficial buff.  I cannot
0 how to do things.
1 my wife mad.  I,
0 B:  when she ever there is something, I say, well, have you read the
1 B:  Oh,  
0 A:  But she would have to cut out different colors, and that is the best book
0 B:  It is.  They, they, they, uh, the photographers just got -- 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And the sloth, it fascinates me.  That's something moves that slow
0 A:  And it is just weird.
0 good news in, in there, you know.  Uh,
0 A:  -- there is no imme-, well, wh-, you know, the financial pages does not hit
0 not keep up on all that.
0 positive, you know.  You always look for things with,
0 A:  -- going down?
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Yeah.  Well, I like Ann Landers [laughter].  
0 T News and all that.
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  There are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or even an hour off
0 A:  Not much, not in the area I worked in [child_talking].  We had an engineer
0 A:  [Child_talking].
0 B:  Oh, yeah.  Uh,  
1 B:  No, right, uh, who knows, uh,  
0 A:  Huh.
1 A:  Except for Donald Duck.  
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  Oh, well.
0 That was all that was there.
0 A:  Okay.
0 A:  Four and five.  Goodness.
1 B:  Oh, well, I have a twenty six year old stepson,
1 B:  Yeah.  It is over with.
1 A:  [Child_talking].
0 A:  If I can just nuke it, I would do it.  But [child_talking] I do not.  I
0 weeds out of that just drives me nuts.  I do not like it. And I just went out
0 B:  Have you had, is this the first year they have been up?
0 B:  They call them flags?
0 B:  When does it, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 higher.
0 A:  -- to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves.  But I took them out of my
1 B:  Ooh.
1 A:  Yeah.
0 That will come back up.
0 plants.  I did not know the hya-, hyacinths were going to die.
0 take the heat down here.
1 A:  Well, I do not know.  How big a city is Rome?  I mean, you have heard
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  No, I have not.  Only to the airport.
1 A:  That is, uh, probably enough to see [laughter].
0 B:  Right.  But even so we had a, uh, uh, at New Years,
0 muggings.  Just, it is, it is, I would not say it is not as bad as New York,
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  you know.  They call them ornamental grates.  But they are still bars
1 [laughter].
0 B:  I do not know, it seems to, I think it is getting worse.  Because I keep
0 just be all shot right now."  And I mean, you he-,
1 sometimes it is the same people that have been, that have been observed and
1 had, uh, he had not, uh, displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or
0 A:  That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not, I do not know
0 A:  Uh,
1 A:  Right.  And discipline.  I do not know how your folks were, but I mean I
0 sure knew as heck when I was growing up that, uh, my parents were [laughter]
1 boundaries.  I mean, I do not, I see it in work place too, sometimes.  I do
0 B:  you know, and I am like, you are the one who signed up.  If you did not
0 B:  Yep, it is.
1 A:  I mean, that is, are you going to be a career person?  I'm digressing, but,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 does not matter race, but, you know, it is an inter racial mix.  And you see
0 A:  No matter who they are or where they are at, you know.
0 town to visit.
1 B:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 have.  But I just looked at the picture and thought, what a world.
0 People, I mean, even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting, you
0 know.  They, everybody wants your business kind of thing.
1 A:  And, uh, he opened the door.  I came downstairs and I was real upset and I
1 A:  you know,  
0 B:  hear about people opening the door and getting blown away.  Or people,
0 I have been to downtown Boston.  And I never felt any safer on Milk Street in
1 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  -- I have been in, you know.  
0 A:  -- myself.  So,
0 A:  I mean,
1 A:  -- is but,
1 B:  -- booked up [laughter].  Yeah. 
0 Or,
0 B:  It seems like a lot of, i-, that it is more, like in Boston, there was a
0 was like to kill someone.
0 B:  -- kid who was like new in town.  And they were like, well, no one was
0 A:  Oh, god.
1 I am just going, Michael,
1 B:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  Right.  
1 B:  Well you have a lot to thank your husband for, noodles.
1 A:  Oh, God, yeah [laughter].  But, 
0 B:  [Laughter] I live in a great pl-, I live in Berkeley, California in what
1 B:  They, uh, they, they, [laughter] they specialize in flower salads actually.
0 B:  You know, combination, this is like during the day.
1 B:  Oh, good.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 there was something other than,
0 ethnic communities, little pockets of ethnicity, in the city,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 follow the chef.  If we know the chef's in a restaurant and what their
1 B:  Really, you know, I mean.
1 A:  [Laughter] It certainly is. 
0 B:  not, not, 
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 with about eighty-six to eighty-eight percent humidity.
1 A:  -- which is unusual for northeast Texas.  Generally we have some, you know,
1 there's, there's always at least one or two good hail storms [laughter],
1 A:  before the season ends.
0 A:  Yeah, last Thursday, though, it was just raining buckets, and it was
1 gone, the sun has come out, and it is hot [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, yes I know.  Unfortunately my air conditioner broke down, uh, two days
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  I consider ninety and above hot [laughter].
1 hundred degree days.
0 time wasn't a real humid area.  But, we've built a lot of lakes and a lot of
1 A:  Well, we have attempted to reforest some areas,
1 forests have been cut down, and then of course, you know, they bulldozed a
1 bunch of forest when they dug out the reservoir (( )) moisture [laughter].
1 B:  Well, don't feel bad, it does here too, and we get snow all the time
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  -- they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that --
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 B:  -- but here, uh, the schools close when there's half an inch of snow
0 as severe, uh, a Winter in the last five years even --
0 B:  So, uh, it has,
1 A:  But, good grief, here, three days for snow days.  Actually one, year before
0 around, but there's a lot of hills around here which means there's a lot of
0 gullies, which means there's a lot of creeks and a lot of flooding.
1 A:  And, uh, that can create almost as a big hazard.  And I drive a little
1 B:  -- so the contrast between the lightning storms I experienced there and the
0 know --
0 B:  But, um, uh, we seem to have a lot, this time of year we seem to have a lot
0 drop down below the upper seventies at night, which means, that --
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  -- uh, this isn't, uh, this is still May.  It's not a real good time of
1 B:  I know, remote control was a great big box,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 lot of that stuff, I mean, another three or four years, you're going to have a
0 [throat_clearing] environmentalists have done their jobs.  Ten to twenty years
0 old girl wrote Gorbachev, or Noriega {spelled phonetically} or someone.
0 about this neighborhood and some activity that's occurring there, and then,
0 A:  -- for a while, and then after they catch that guy, you know, you can let
0 miles away, like to school and the like, but when we were in the country we
1 A:  -- and if there any trouble was they could come find us, but, uh, can't do
0 A:  Just no safe place to let your kid go that long and, of course, it probably
0 school, they had a drug awareness week type deal that we studied in the
0 science classes, and we got little posters and we did all sorts of stuff, but
1 don't say anything in public to a stranger about his smoking [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Went outside, but.  My stepdaughter's getting like that, and that's pretty
0 A:  Hopefully, hopefully, 
1 A:  It's quite an expense too, now, they keep deciding that's the thing to tax
0 B:  Well, who is the major enemy now?
1 A:  Of course, there, you wouldn't be able to go over and attack them, but I
0 uh, computer world out there.
0 A:  Uh, what's, what's your application for P C -s?
0 spreadsheets, um, just all kinds of things.
0 recognition.  It's, uh, I don't know how old it is, but I know they've been
1 pursuing it for a long time.
0 of one kind or another, but the latest one I bought for the children to use,
1 B:  Oh, that's interesting, isn't it.
0 A:  -- and, uh, enhanced with, uh, the Texas Instrument D S P board --
0 B:  Well, that's wonderful, that's wonderful.  Now if we can get everybody
0 pull some of these results together,
0 B:  That wouldn't be a bad idea, though, do you think that,
0 lot of commercial products on the market --
0 is very fascinating, and I don't know that much about it.  I know that, um, in
1 totally different.  So, uh, my interest was spurred, and then it was
0 B:  Oh, that's wonderful.
1 Uh, I know, because you have children, too, and you're also interested in the,
1 uh, voice recognition.  It's been so long since [laughter] my chil-, my
1 what's going on in the schools today.  I'm not active in any school other than
0 B:  Well, either, you know.  Uh, I have a, a nine year old daughter, and there
1 so bad.
1 liberty and pursuit of happiness, then taking that away is a, a heinous act.
0 capital murder is, do, capital punishment is, do you know?  Are there some set
0 B:  -- such as rape, deserves punishment by death.  But then I'm also told that
1 I'm a pretty harsh person.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  You know, that second group of people falls into the group that I say give
1 first person,
0 A:  Right.
1 B:  I think I would probably lower the age to about fourteen.  
0 do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include
1 think that I saw it in him until maybe last year,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  -- namely lots of vacations --
0 A:  Uh.
1 B:  -- so I'm taking a little bit of a time off from work.
0 health insurance only covers, um, the emergency care.
0 B:  -- it doesn't cover --
0 A:  Yeah, I know where my daughter works, now she, she, course we live in a, a
1 B:  Wow.
0 B:  Well, I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston --
0 B:  So I was pretty shocked at that.  But the other thing that I'm really
0 A:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And I,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 easier.
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  Right, yeah.
0 B:  But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen
0 B:  Like, uh, one company had proposed to me that I could come back to work
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  A (( )) consultant really is, should be more knowledgeable than everybody
0 and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  My husband likes golf also, he's, uh, I guess he'd be a fanatic if
1 B:  I can't even play miniature golf well.
0 A:  Right.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting
1 for so [laughter],
0 A:  Oh.
1 not going to stay interested in him.  So I decided Andy Bean was good
1 B:  and I followed Andy Bean.
0 A:  I like to watch him.
1 golf.  You hit a little ball,
1 B:  And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole,
1 B:  but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier.
1 A:  Oh really [laughter].
0 They play like maybe once a month or less --
1 A:  -- and so they all hit like in the low nineties, and they think they're
0 having a really good game [laughter].
0 move into maturity --
0 B:  That's right, that's right.
1 B:  Yeah, when you're too old to do anything else --
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].
1 [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] You bet, you get a lot of exercise that way.
0 A:  Oh, no, yeah.
0 A:  -- and how immature he thought it was and stuff.
1 hundreds, and he'll tell me what a great day he had, and about this great shot
1 B:  Uh-huh, well I shot in the hundreds, but I made this one good one
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, this one, on this one hole [laughter].
1 A:  -- those are, it's hard for me to,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 There's so many,
0 involved if you're going to try to go pro, because you spend hours and hours
0 and hours --
0 interested in golf.  I said I don't know, I'll have to try it and see.  I've
0 B:  And he said, well, fine, he said, we'll just take you over to the course,
1 B:  Oh, whoa, great, I get to walk all around a little green field all day.
1 B:  You know, I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball,
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  and, hu-, hu-, hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball.
1 A:  Yeah at least you're just com-, --
0 open to try anything,
0 A:  #Okay,# we're going to talk about lawn and garden today.
0 A:  -- do you, you wish to discuss that?
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  And, uh, but grew up in, uh, Iowa on a farm with a considerably different
1 @B:  So, uh, [lipsmack] uh, not, not growing up familiar with here, uh, uh,
1 B:  #Tr-, tr-,# tried some, tried some different, 
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  So I found, you know, and I've got some problems with, uh, two trees in my
0 B:  #Yeah.#
1 B:  #No.#
1 off and then spray it with this chemical that he said I should purchase.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  #Yeah.#
1 will.
0 B:  #Well, what kind# --
0 A:  And, uh, the one that, the ones that really do well are the ones that are
1 on the city property, and they don't,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
1 A:  #and they're# cedar elm, and they're just beautiful.
0 A:  #Uh, uh-huh# [breathing].
0 and uh, and then, uh, a year ago we lost, uh, #another one.#
0 circumference of about ten inches, #and,#
0 B:  stump killer, and stump, stump rotter,
0 B:  But, uh, this last one had a fair sized root and some guy was doing a job
0 screwing thing that #just rips it right out.#
0 I, it's been fifteen years now, since we first moved to Texas, we've had it,
1 and, uh, [lipsmack] and, uh, I do it #my, do it myself.#
0 B:  [Hiss] Well, um, I'm in my, I, I, I've seen the changes, I think, in my
0 B:  I, I agree with that, and I also think that they're taking a lead in, in
0 inherited the firm from their father.  You know, that sort of thing.  #But# --
1 there, uh, seem to have a little bit more intelligence than their counterparts
1 it.  I mean, if they're just old ladies sitting around waiting for the end to
1 come, it doesn't do them much good [laughter].
0 A:  Um.
1 B:  #So, uh,# uh, you know, it's going to get to a point, I, some men are going
1 to wonder if they're falling behind [laughter].
0 A:  It's real bad there.  Has been for a few years.  Especially on the Dallas
0 B:  And that was always a, a fairly good area in there, if I remember
0 well, especially Dallas.  Last year in Fort Worth, this year,
0 B:  Is that right?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  They stole the emblem off of one of mine.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And actually if we had to call him a few times, and they're usually on the
0 B:  Course, as I say, we're a small town.
0 B:  Okay, have a good evening.
1 B:  Oh, really.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Are you, uh, solicited a lot, uh, for other, uh, credit cards?
0 A:  Yeah.
1 another twenty-five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty-one
0 A:  Right, right.  And I look for a grace period too, so that they don't charge
0 interest on --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  if you got to use that credit card.
1 A:  Yeah, I always maintain a zero balance, uh, don't like owing anybody
0 anything [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, it just bo-, worry about it tomorrow.  
0 A:  Nobody bothers saving any money.
0 B:  Yeah, and it just, I don't, I don't really go for them.  And I, in fact, I
0 B:  -- and ended up cutting them up just for the fact that T I had lower rates.
1 your new, you know, balance with bonus points or whatever,
1 B:  -- and I don't want any more of your letters, I don't want anything, and
0 A:  I get a lot of, uh, preapproved applications from various organizations
0 permission anyway.
1 B:  What do you think about that, uh, Discover card?
1 a, uh, one dollar check from them out of my briefcase today that expired, uh,
0 school system, between Richardson is fine, and my son was in Garland and
0 B:  Oh, my goodness, I think the biggest problem for now days with the school
0 responsibilities off on the teachers, and I don't think they should.  I think
0 B:  Uh, sometimes [laughter] --
0 B:  Well, that's, that's what I'm saying.
0 A:  -- they are school age, and, and,
1 problems in school, but not like this.  Nothing like the guns and the, and
0 it's like a hazardous job, now, in some schools, I should say.  Not all
0 schools.  Some schools.  You know it's,
0 system, so I mean, we just, I mean, they just knew that they had to toe the
0 A:  Well, I guess that's the bottom line, if the children do know right from
0 things like that when they were small.  And it's just, uh, it's helps, I
0 seem so dead to the kids, you know, unless they've actually been there or
0 A:  Yes.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- because this place gets very cold very soon.
1 like his dad had done with him.
0 B:  Yeah, that is nice.
1 B:  So that the only reason I'm home is because I'm home with a cold
0 [laughter].
1 the north side of Dallas, Texas.
0 B:  Right.  Yeah, I'm an electrical engineer by trade --
1 A:  Yeah.  I'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a
1 failed savings and loan [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  So, Trying to work myself out of a job [laughter].
1 up back about two hundred miles aware, away from where we started out.
0 A:  Thank you.
0 A:  Adult contemporary, soft rock --
1 B:  Oh yeah.
1 B:  -- you know.  And I, course I was listening to rock music.  But what I
0 A:  Well, it's, I, I was just thinking, uh, you know, we, we say, or K V I L
1 A:  -- you know, it took a, a while before I really liked the Beatles.
1 B:  That's funny.  Well, I'm probably older than you then [laughter].
1 A:  -- that's probably what it was.
1 A:  I was past that point --
0 Elvis --
1 B:  -- because, uh, she'll see him, she'll go, Oh you mean you really thought
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Um, you know, but, uh, I guess, musicians or singers in particular, uh,
0 B:  -- and my husband has always been just total rock --
0 A:  Yes, I,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- Grammy, it's the Grammy awards -- 
0 B:  -- they give for music, yeah.  He won a Grammy for inspirational song of
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, um, then my husband, on the other hand, he, I guess, when he was like
1 A:  Uh,
0 A:  That's, uh, our son goes, you know, goes off into his room and turns his
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  -- very much, but he'd go into his room and turn it up, you know, and we'd
1 do our best to, to live with it or get him to turn it down [laughter].
0 A:  -- you know, it's, I'm not, uh, I don't, uh, I don't find too much of the
1 A:  So, instead, you buy Sandy Patty --
0 Christ --
1 B:  -- at Church of Christ that think, uh,
0 on a lot, and I love, um, this, you know, that K L T Y, that's what I listen
0 B:  Well, I told my husband, the one thing I like about it is, uh, you know,
0 B:  -- I'll be washing dishes or something, and I'll think about a song, and
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Well, I think they're useful, I think they're in some instances they're,
0 helps them accomplish something.
0 all.
0 which just really is a waste of time, and then, if they ever have to change
0 B:  -- whenever they wanted to make a change,
0 B:  so I, I've seen that as a problem.
0 B:  And they set it up manually, so that they have all their spacings and
0 B:  then when they have to make a change, say they want to insert a
0 A:  Right.
0 out of the manual.  Some manuals aren't really designed very well.
0 program still has, uh, bugs in it, and you have to work around it.
1 A:  Oh, okay.  
0 A:  I think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen, is it Brochco, who
1 start showing some of their newer stuff.
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].
0 have probably learned quite a bit from there.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  -- and I thought, Oh, how violent, you know, to kill the rabbit.  So he
0 that would be pretty violent even for a small child.
0 A:  Right.
1 A:  -- but they don't, they just have one like we do [laughter].
0 B:  I think,
0 B:  -- had a hard time, and I think maybe with DALLAS, as far as, they lost a
0 A:  That's true, that's true.
0 all the women.
0 A:  Yes.  So the men mainly stayed but the women were the ones who left, and I
1 thought that was very interesting and wondered, kind of wondered about that.
1 Uh, well, anyway that's a whole new issue [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  Oh.
1 A:  [Laughter] Oh, goodness so.  Anyway.  I don't know if our five minutes are
0 teenagers, is that all the violence, the sex, the nudity and the curse words
0 --
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  And especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the
0 humidity being so high.
1 B:  Well, true,
0 B:  Yeah.
1 my criteria for cars is, uh, of being solid, able to take an impact 
0 A:  -- and, uh, so, uh, I, we're not going to be in the market for, in the near
0 A:  Uh, our, our [noise] van, which is a, a delight to drive, does not have, I
0 B:  You don't have to stretch.
1 A:  But you know, I've lived all these years without them, I probably could
0 B:  That's right.
0 they,
0 A:  So, uh, if you were to buy a new car now, a brand new car, what would you
0 car that's as dependable as Mercedes or somebody, you know that's,
0 anywhere, most local garages can fix you up.
0 giving up.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 jugs [laughter] before you take them up there.
0 for them.
0 for picking up your garbage.
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah that would be a real good idea.  I'm trying to think if
0 wha-, carpet cleaning, and, uh, what else, roof repair [dishes] And enough,
0 something that you don't need.  And the same way with those calls.  What is
0 calling back.
0 A:  Right.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 a good item anyway.
0 B:  I think that's invasion of privacy.
1 years that they've been on the air,
1 is nerve racking.  I mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone, but at
1 B:  My answer is no thank you, I don't need it.  And they say, well don't you
1 taxes.  How about you?
1 A:  Yeah, oh definitely [laughter].  ((Seems)) like, 
0 B:  [Laughter] Although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet.
0 And it was really a great relief when I got to Texas that I didn't have to pay
0 B:  Yeah, makes quite a bit of difference in your, uh, well your income level.
0 A:  Oh, you do?
0 A:  Okay, and then, you know too, that, um, taxes are, are less, like if you
0 recharged it and put one, one pound of freon in and if you needed another
0 B:  Although I wi-, I wish, you know, overall they'd try the lottery again.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well, uh, I did visit, uh, Michigan, I visited Kalamazoo once.
1 shop on Sunday.  
1 and I couldn't find hardly anything open, 
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Were you shocked like, oh no, I'm stuck I need to buy stuff.
1 B:  [Sniffing].
0 slice of pizza [laughter], 
0 A:  -- and, uh, that would have been enough to, to make me, me give them up.
0 B:  Um.
0 they were getting a big discount.
0 because it's, it's, the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth.
1 B:  Well how did you do?
0 A:  Well I, basic feeling is that everybody performs some sort of public
0 {faintly} particularly those that are gifted and talented, uh, and highly
0 that's, uh, not down their alley.
0 they go to their knees.
0 B:  Uh, I myself have done a lot of volunteer work, but I am very apprehensive
0 and we visited sick people.  Those are all good community service behaviors
0 A:  by going to work for one of the, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.  And, uh, everybody has there, uh, soapbox.  I have a lot of people
0 A:  in terms of energy.  And I've been involved in research diving on several
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 personal energy than just shell out a few bucks and let my conscience rest.  
0 B:  I feel like that you, I don't know, the, the benefit to you is much, of
0 getting more, more actively involved with the, uh, Sierra Club.
0 B:  But it might be of interest to put in some sort of a formal system like
0 are your interests and what are your aptitudes.  Let's see if we can match you
0 know, out and get mosquito bit and s-, sleep on a hard ground when I can sit
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And there are a lot of them who just do not have that sense of
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 general area there is, uh, National, Dulles, and then, uh, Baltimore,
1 B:  we certainly turned into an air conditioned -- 
1 B:  -- [Laughter] society.  
0 A:  you know, improved.  Well, I guess the fur-, the, to me the first thing
0 terms of demanding, it's just not caused but demanding that, uh, we can spend
0 B:  That's right.  That's right.  
0 B:  That, that, the, the smell is awful and but, you know, I was reading the
0 B:  diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yes I me-,
1 ((Seabrook)) and I kind of, uh,
0 A:  Yeah, you don't throw the baby out with the bath water, 
1 B:  Un-, unfortunately though I think the oil companies have lied to us for
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 leave, uh, this area, w-, we're going north, not south.
0 B:  Yes.  
1 B:  on airplanes and in restaurants.  And it, it really is a pleasure for me,
1 B:  to me was pollution (( )),
0 [laughter].
0 B:  #Bye-bye.#  
1 of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen million
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 shopping and stuff.  The stores around here don't let you do it too much.
1 A:  #Oh, really?# 
1 B:  Yeah, I, I never pay finance charges on them except when I screw up which I
1 occasionally [laughter] do.
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 finance charges.
0 A:  Yeah, I don't either.  
0 B:  You know, ((kind of the)), because you never d-, when I pay bills I don't
0 A:  you don't want to end up having to pay for it.  
0 B:  Well, you can,
0 took care of it as soo-, as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay.
1 I mailed off a check but then it was too late.  So now they're hitting ((me up
1 there)) [laughter] with a finance charge.
0 A:  w-, yeah, if you filed that letter with them then they will kind of,
0 B:  ((Yeah.))
0 A:  about the yearly fees.  I don't, uh, I don't like to pay the yearly fee
0 for a card.  Right now both the MasterCard and the Visa, we don't have to pay
0 A:  -- since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the
0 had American Express cards and my husband had always had that before we got
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  it, you know, a couple of plain tickets and a little bit more and you're
1 say there is no limit.  There really is but they,
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Well so,
1 B:  -- and sometimes it comes in right away and it's like, oh, well, guess,
0 B:  I have to pay that too.  
1 it right away anyway.
0 in or something.
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Oh.  
0 an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee.
0 even, you know,
0 like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which, um,
1 ((you)), hopefully you never use.
0 notice how many, oh well that restaurant's changed, and oh, gee, there, they've
0 A:  [Laughter]  You know, your, your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and
0 restaurant which is the Mansion on Turtle Creek.  I mean we've got beautiful
1 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 part of the country you want to hit, they have got it.  I mean, Vietnamese
1 dollars a plate or something silly like that. 
0 B:  And there's, they're starting to get a little bit different, um, they're,
0 really, you know, want to be wowed by, um, the presentation, so to speak. 
0 A:  And, uh, you know, but, but there are little places, um, and like I said,
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 know, both parts because,
0 B:  We have two, uh, two very special places in Northern Virginia that people
1 B:  And, um, Captain Pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside,
0 B:  # and # people just go in there and just pig out and everything.  And then,
1 B:  # And, # uh, people go there to be abused.  I mean,
0 A:  Oh, that's a talent. 
1 seized. 
1 your hand and say thanks, you know. 
0 right there so it's display cooking and, and, uh, then they have wine casks all
1 B:  So you don't have any benefits at all to talk about. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  No. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  You're just going to have to imagine what you would like as
1 benefits [laughter]. 
0 B:  Didn't get that far. 
0 A:  No. 
0 few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to, um, set hospitals in
1 doesn't seem to be too good and I know when you first start out working you're
0 A:  Oh, I like to think about that. 
0 and you go, is that all that's in there.  I don't think's it's going to pay
0 B:  # Of # course you can buy stock in the company, but, you know, that's not
1 always a real, for sure kind of thing.  Cour-,
1 this year it's thirty six dollars a share, and you go, gee, I'm losing money
0 B:  Which, a lot of places make you work like ten years or so,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  So and, um, he works for the, did you ever hear of the National Bureau of
0 A:  # Right, right [laughter].  #
0 B:  # and those ones # that you couldn't really care about so much but you get
0 has all that and with his doctors and stuff, they have, um, a list of doctors
0 that doctor. 
0 know, Contact stuff, only better.  Um, you that's like a buck a capsule. 
0 you're at work?  Do you have a chance to look through the WALL STREET JOURNAL? 
0 uh, kind of dominant.  There's no competition, so what you get is what you
1 watch the six o'clock news on television,
0 B:  # No [laughter].  #
0 A:  And if you catch the news stations, uh, you don't catch that much in the
0 A:  Yeah but, uh,
1 last week and it might be local and it might be national and I'm like, no, I
0 missed that one [laughter].
0 then leave the commentaries out.  But so many times you get, well, uh, this is
0 A:  # Right, it's the same # 
0 is the most popular issue of the time.  Whether it be the homeless or, uh,
1 B:  Yeah, that's true, that's true, and it's frustrating. 
1 as much as I want and when I do I'm wondering why I wanted to see it so bad
1 [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  #Yeah, well that's about all then.# 
0 B:  Bye-bye. 
0 know, the engine's in excellent shape,
0 getting up in age, uh, we're trying to hold out a little while longer, uh,
1 because, uh, 
1 I, I've, I've thought of that possibly, uh, getti-, I don't know that my wife
0 would go for it, but [laughter].  
0 B:  Well.
0 trips especially.
0 B:  We have definitely put a lot of use in on ours and I understand, it is too
0 It's just, 
1 A:  something, buying something else.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  And we have had just wonderful luck with ours.  I mean it's, we take it
0 B:  Oh,  yeah.
1 A:  Y-, you too, I ho-, 
1 B:  Okay, let's do i-,
0 A:  do you work?  
0 B:  Um, you know, there's a, my neighbor she tends children though and, and,
0 A:  Uh-huh, how old, 
1 A:  is your oldest?  
1 B:  He's almost a teenager [laughter].  
0 I would use, uh, kids from our church,
1 A:  She, she surprised me though.  She's done a lot of things that I never
1 have any children.
1 A:  And, uh, she, she also had a small child she brought with her.  And it did
1 A:  Well, my daughter decided to call them and check and things weren't okay
0 A:  And so that ended that, 
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  and so on.  Uh-huh.  
0 that you [baby] would be good to get references,
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
0 B:  You can't really.  You can't really unless your child would be old enough
0 A:  {Very faint} Yeah.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  And, and you know, the grandparents, uh, I always hear it's always fun when
1 to,
1 A:  Right.  That's right [laughter]. 
1 A:  a some, somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun, they
1 grandparents complaining --
1 against, uh, ((gratin)) to stop construction because it was unfairly obtained,
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  because the, the, the base that New England always had, the textile base
0 I think up,
0 it's not,
0 B:  here rather than, 
0 A:  And you can give a thousand rockets of a relatively unin-, unin-,
0 A:  Um, [lipsmack] the savings and loans crisis.  
0 B:  Can't, yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  So they had a conflict of interests -- 
0 A:  Okay.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  But I tend to be very lazy,
1 does not have the food content that they manage to do.
0 A:  [Breathing] So she still likes to, to cook a large, uh, variety of foods.
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 something she wants to experiment on, she'll experiment on company because
1 usually they're polite enough to eat it anyway [laughter],
1 A:  instead of the family, you know, so.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Um, interesting.  
0 topping.
1 B:  Far fewer calories and far less cholesterol.  Uh,
0 A:  uh, you know, bad for you,
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 B:  I'd rather die than eat --  
1 accustom to that kind of discipline can actually tolerate it much better than
1 A:  Um.   
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 upset.  Second, it's a big mess to clean up.
1 A:  I'll say.  
0 A:  -- bread.   
0 changes that have occurred.  I guess the, whatever entity is moving us toward
1 B:  Yes.  Yes.  
0 B:  so I called [breathing] four or five dog trainers because I don't like
0 B:  And, and I asked them, you know, these are the ages of the kids, what do I
1 get.  And they all said, Golden Retriever and I said okay,
0 like a Golden Retriever, but she's a little bit smaller.  She's like
0 B:  You cannot show your retriever if it's, you know, a hundred plus pounds.
0 substitute kid and she was a lot of fun.
0 B:  because I had a retriever, actually I had a retriever Irish Setter cross.
0 And in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big, for somehow big is
0 B:  We w-, when I was, when I bought my last purebred retriever I mean I looked
0 B:  -- animal that could hunt and still be in the house.  And I ended up
0 A:  Oh.  
1 standing there barking and jumping up and down.  And one dog would stand there
0 B:  you know the, the German shepherd is the classic case of what I'm talking
0 is that people saw the, the first, um, which would actually have been a
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  And everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin.  
0 standard.  The American Kennel Club did.
0 German shepherd here.
1 you.
0 Alsatian that's the kid's dog.  It's just, you see them in Europe and they're
0 B:  But you'll see, I mean, if you ever start looking in papers now and you
0 get, you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific, you know,
1 B:  {Very faint}  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  How about paid time off?  
1 A:  Uh, yeah, that's, uh, just vacation and some sick leave.  Not very much
0 difficult for them to provide ((print)) pension benefits too.  It's, uh,
0 B:  Yeah, we-, d-, as you get closer to that time you start, #you know, you
1 A:  the polic-, [laughter] pension.  
0 A:  Even if he changes companies he can, you know, roll that over,
0 A:  {Very faint} Yeah.
0 B:  I meant, they don't match it exactly,
1 B:  but fifty, fifty percent which is good.  
1 A:  so I, I just felt, you know, at a, I need to find a company like that
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 advantage of them of, uh, like memberships and clubs the people that, uh, have
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  {Very faint}  Yeah [breathing].
1 B:  motivation.  
0 A:  holder happy [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Good-bye.
1 B:  My goodness.  
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 start saying they're, you know, young adults,
0 of your child.
0 B:  So,
0 someone, you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people
0 know, she was a younger lady.  She didn't really know my mom.  She knew my mom
0 in diapers when I started baby-sitting.
1 never, and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.
1 A:  Uh-huh, yes.    
0 day care or anything.
0 child.
0 A:  #Well,#
0 B:  Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.
0 work north.
1 A:  Yes, exactly.  
1 B:  Oh, money is always a factor in my life, 
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  I love it, but it comes on so late.  
1 A:  Oh, you do?  [laughter]
1 A:  Yeah, I'm sure my husband doesn't care too much for that either
1 [laughter].
0 A:  #Yeah,# um, channel thirteen had on a, a thing about astronomy that was
0 B:  And, uh, so we're, we're, we're pretty (( )) watchers.  We've, I've been
1 introduced to the joys of STAR TREK so we watch that with,
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  total, total devotion.  
0 B:  and, uh, and so but I, I like the cast of the new one so, uh, that's what
0 T V section and decide what I'm going to watch and watch it.
0 B:  But as a rule I don't sort of stroll around the dial and, 
1 A:  with the old remote control in hand [laughter]. 
1 B:  Yes.  Unlike certain parties [laughter].
0 thought, well, I ought to get the Disney channel because there's some fun
0 B:  they would enjoy that.  
0 A:  Yeah, I think I might have to do that.  But I mean, just some of the movies
1 B:  I wouldn't admit it to anybody (( )).  
1 B:  Oh, well, [throat_clearing] yes, you hit upon a, a weak spot of mine.
1 A:  Yeah, it was neat.  
1 B:  N-, I mean, forty, I'm here twenty years later (( )) [laughter].
1 B:  And so, uh, b-, but I've already got that on tape so we didn't tape it
1 [laughter].
0 @@A:  Yeah, because that does happen a lot.  There is nothing on anywhere on
1 B:  It's surprising with all the choice we have sometimes there's no choice.
0 A:  Oh.  Yeah, I've, I've already finished mine.  I haven't done my dishes yet.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Bye-bye.  
1 A:  Yeah, I think right now it's, it's kind of bad [baby].  Uh, I don't live in
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Well, I guess the best I can do is, is, uh, compare apartments
1 [laughter].
0 am, there's a patio.
0 A:  Well, I, I, I have a washer and dryer area and I, I did buy the washer and
1 B:  [Sniffing]. 
1 B:  So it's really surprising everybody.  [sniffing] All the developers don't
0 A:  Oh, so you want a bigger one.
1 A:  Actual [noise] (( )) a,
0 B:  Yeah, a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there, and that's
1 A:  Right.  
1 B:  Maybe it's all the sand.  Is there a lot of sand in, I always think it's
1 like a desert, I don't know.  [laughter] [sniffing] (( )) Dallas always, 
0 B:  No, Virginia.  
0 Back before I was born,
0 Texas I'll say because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay.
1 B:  Yeah, well, uh, Texas is a big state so I imagine the, the type of houses
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  So, you know, you really can't afford, I, I, I could never afford a house
0 twenty-five --
0 that.
0 B:  No, we're in a development.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Hi, um, this is Betty and I'm in Richardson, Texas.
1 B:  I'm Nola and I'm in Plano.
1 A:  Oh, okay, well here we go [laughter].
0 B:  Okay, but, I think it's, I just started doing this so I don't know too
0 that that's been proven in the fact that, um, they have just, well, anyway, I
0 States and other countries can do, as far as example and, and, uh, {pause}, I
0 Palestinian situation, um, sort of came to a head, um, unless there had been a
0 along.  It's not going to be that we're going to, uh, you know, sort of, tell
0 B:  But, that's the type of thing they understand.
0 that area of the country and I mean he is just overly, he, he is abounding in
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  And it's always been military and it's always been, and that's, that's
0 always been the way of the world.  Don't you think [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
1 my kids to do that, so, [laughter]
0 up, but it's so simple and it tastes really good because it's cool in the
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh, that sounds good.
1 A:  And tha-, it was real good.  You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that
1 way and then people think they're eating steak or something [laughter].
0 A:  It really does.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 the summertime.
0 B:  Well you see all that on T V and I could never be that person.  
1 food, she really goes all out and I don't know how she can do it and be calm
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, that really is.  It keeps the family in touch with what's going on
1 it's [laughter],  
1 the door.
0 B:  Yeah, they're so simple.
1 A:  Oh, neat.
1 B:  sometimes he fixes me breakfast [laughter].
0 A:  Eleven, wow, 
0 A:  that's good.
0 something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal,
0 B:  Um.
0 you have a microwave book, but you cook it a little bit less and then let it
0 B:  And let it steam.  
1 B:  -- they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave.
1 with their eyes they go, uh, I don't like want that,
1 make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there, you know, 
1 A:  Well, I just found out that my car {talks like an old woman} was thirty
1 don't prefer buying a new car.  I like to let somebody else pay for that
1 B:  and I'll drive it until it no longer is reliable.  
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  And probably then some [laughter]. 
0 got it.
0 B:  So, I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto, 
1 B:  uh, reports inst-, had my son who knows a lot about that, study them
0 A:  Okay, 
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  -- then I'd buy me a fancy little red ((C R X)) sports car [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] Okay [laughter].
1 A:  Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car
0 [laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Thank you.  {pause} Well, that was one minute.  They hung up.
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 that you would be looking for?
0 A:  Um, and the luxuries of a large car.  
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
1 A:  Which is probably closest to gold that you can get [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  [laughter] We like the stuff that glitters [laughter].
1 B:  Good.  
0 A:  Right and it's cooler I believe, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
1 B:  [Laughter]  But if I had the little red ((C R X)), 
0 B:  I guess the interior would have to be black leather and I'd have to live
0 A:  Thanks {pause}.  I've got the phones for lunch hour.  
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  All the, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  You know, [laughter] there's nothing in there that can wrap around the,
0 the, uh, rollers or anything.  It seems like a really good answer to portable
0 A:  Um, I see.  
0 B:  uh, setup and that way [throat_clearing] they, they are able to reduce
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 other day and they were talking that, s-, s-, something like this, I think
0 that.
0 like it, I, I really kind of did.  Uh, the reason I quite was just because
0 complain saying well, I don't want to, uh, have to be told who I need to go to
0 B:  Delivery room and everything.  
0 B:  to take care of a problem before it grows big.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  {Very faint} [throat_clearing].
0 whatever.  You just pay the, the five dollars right then and then you're done
0 A:  So, they spread the costs out over, uh, all the patient costs and, uh,
0 B:  You know, they, they get a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, people who are j-,
0 just have to be there and can't afford it and so they, they know they're not
0 B:  Right.  
0 B:  I'm trying to think offhand I can't think of anything, you know.
1 A:  (( )) and it's a real pet peeve of mine.  
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 turns out to be a telephone salesman.
1 A:  And I, I try to be polite, 
0 A:  but at the same point,  
0 B:  That doesn't always work.  
1 B:  Oh, really?  
1 A:  Yes, and it works very well [laughter]. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  from a busi-, 
0 company is not allowed to sent it, you any junk mail.
0 B:  Oh, really?  
0 that you fill out to, not to get, you know, junk mail from specific companies.
1 B:  I can't stand that.  
1 giving,
1 B:  Yeah.   
0 and then they ask for a telephone number.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 been)) my husband's office phone number.  And, uh, we were able, we weren't
0 other thing is though you do not have to, if you're buying something in a
0 B:  Oh, I never even knew that.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well, is there any, 
1 little pet peeves, you know, with my family.
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  [Laughter] You know.  But of course, th-, I guess that just comes with the,
0 uh, with the territory with a family that [laughter] ((does a mother can do))
1 some privacy.
0 B:  No.  I, you know, othe-, I, I really can't say anything that would really
0 A:  And but of course, now by law they ((can't)) ask that.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  I think it's for the better of like i-, you mean like for working and
0 A:  Yeah, uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  You know, for example airline pilots.  I mean I do want my pilot to be
1 ==========================================================================
1 @A:  Okay.  Well, I worked out today [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  
1 B:  Yeah, it, th-, the recorder came on I went, oh, boy, d-, how do I miss
1 today because I thought if I'd be there right now [laughter],
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Yeah, mine is just female.  I'm too big of a wimp to go to the male and
1 something.
0 A:  [Laughter].  Fall off the bench.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah.  Because I have broken both my ankles, 
0 A:  Well, I, I read an article that it's really not that good on your knees.
0 think that's what they pretty much recommend.  But still, uh, I think that
1 B:  or something because that I have no need for that muscle back there
0 like that quite a bit.
0 B:  ((Now I've been to that)).  I haven't been to that yet, uh, I've, I've it
1 B:  I've never,
0 A:  Yeah.
1 me are just pumping it like, you know.
1 B:  And I'm going there's got to be something wrong here and the guy looks over
1 B:  So let's turn it down.  
0 A:  I attempted going in the mornings, and it was really good because then it
0 much harder to get up that much earlier.
0 A:  Oh, I hate running.  
0 B:  Yeah, it could be.  Of course, I don't know it could be great for business.
1 A:  Yeah, I wo-, I did.  I literally went in one day in my linen skirt and a
0 B:  Well, I'm looking forward to it.  
1 A:  I'm sure you'll look fine in your bathing suit.  
1 B:  Yeah [laughter]. 
0 B:  Oh, we have a lake party this weekend so, 
0 A:  maybe this weekend.  
0 B:  Yeah, if it's good.  We've, we've been out a couple times and gotten into
0 A:  Which lake do you go to?  
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  -- in the past, uh, now that it has gone off [laughter]. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 A:  Yeah, I thought a lot of the, like the problems that Michael and Hope had
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 [inhaling]  it's, uh, very little T V time left. 
0 A:  # Right, yeah.  #
0 A:  Do you watch sports much on T V?
1 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 B:  # I # know we, [inhaling] we have done that too in the past, uh, we do not
1 B:  # we live in, #
0 B:  # but # when they built our section they did not, did not put it in and
0 houses will be,
0 B:  # and # so they, uh, they look and they, when they, when we reach a certain
0 an hour,
1 B:  So,
0 are doing other things and these programs come in, sometimes they influence us
0 A:  I think you have to have the will and the, and, uh, anyway, I think it,
0 UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.  Those are fascinating to me.
1 A:  Oh [laughter].
0 contemporary humor.
0 one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians.
0 A:  and that's something.  But,
0 A:  of Thirteen, uh, THE MCLAUGHLIN GROUP, and I,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  watching that.  I mean, I do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the,
1 B:  Well [sigh],
0 impact.  I do a lot of channel thirteen, channel three, some of the
0 A:  and that, you know,
0 B:  I was just absolutely, 
0 B:  you just held you breath,
0 B:  over you.  #So,#
1 makes me want to cook,
1 B:  and then I eat,
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  And, and there's some, um, in fact, one of the water color shows, I know,
0 B:  Oh, I think that's,
0 A:  So,
0 B:  marvelous.
1 B:  and, I want you to know that became the most suspicious, cantankerous,
1 contrary old [laughter] woman [laughter] ever walked.
1 B:  Absolutely, 
1 B:  Well, she was grumpy to begin with.
1 stick,
1 the kids watch that and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid I ever saw.
1 B:  and, uh, for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  That's right, that's right.  
0 A:  you know.
0 A:  I know, I remember going to sch-, my parents were a lot like, too and of
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  did you see how he did that and did you see, and I could never
1 A:  You know, to, uh,
0 B:  Uh, actually my last vacation was in Connecticut.  Uh, we went home to
1 B:  It wasn't actually.  It, w-, when we were in Oah-, Oahu, uh, I couldn't
1 wait to get off [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah, yes.  So where have you been?
1 A:  -- and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa and I needed to get
1 that continent ((since)) I [laughter],
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  when my father worked there we, they used to travel quite a bit, all
1 B:  So I don't remember but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these
1 great places that they have been [laughter],
0 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].
0 B:  and that I was when I was a baby but so,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Well that's great.  Where else have you been?
0 A:  Uh, my more exciting spots have been, I've been to the Galapagos Islands.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  I don't remember if I had shrimp.
1 A:  I don't think so.
1 B:  I remember food [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] Oh, I like that too.  But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that
0 A:  with a bunch of people.
0 A:  and, you know, they were newly built and they were sort of the lower end
0 B:  because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're,
1 ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman, her name was Rita
0 and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun,
0 B:  Yeah, #that would be,#
0 B:  In California they make you register when you buy ammunition.

0 purpose, legal purpose --
1 B:  No, huh-uh.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 and, you know, like I told him, you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go
0 B:  so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of
1 windows and I took it away from him, I said now,

1 A:  Well, that's true,
0 A:  # can rent # it or something. 
0 A:  Yeah.  But, but then I also see, um, oh I do not know, this one case here

0 A:  Did you see SIXTY MINUTES, by any chance, on, um, I guess it was this past
0 his ex-wife to death, because she was sleeping with another guy,
0 A:  However, I have been persuaded, lately, I guess, simply by the, uh,
0 without, with, with little success, even though the entire, I guess a, a quite
0 a bit of money and other, uh, planning efforts went into that.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 violent, but, so they just throw something in there just to say they have it
1 Now, I do not want to sound like an old fart, but,
0 morals.  For instance, uh, they asked him if he spanked his kids, and he said
0 B:  And, just, it seems anymore that, uh, if, if you have, you know, this type
1 changes come simply by statutory nature.  I do not know what it really will
0 B:  you know, what you see and how yo-, I mean, what you see affects how you
0 think and therefore what you do.
0 B:  and, I guess it's, uh, it's kind of, well, sort of big for the area, um,
1 B:  to go out in now, and then a fence around the yard so that the kids can
0 A:  We have almost an acre.
0 house, but you can fit four cars in it, it's long enough, you know, you can
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 and it's like, oh, ((they must be)) (( )) car garage.
0 Our back porch, we enclosed.
0 B:  Uh, okay.  Well, what we have, our family room and, we bought it, we

1 B:  when we first saw it.
1 B:  When you actually have to mow it, it seems to get bigger.
0 there.
0 A:  uh, it, well we have just an acre, we, uh,
1 B:  Use a rider.
1 A:  Yeah  [laughter].  
0 month.  And, uh, I usually prepare something, depending upon the guests, you

0 B:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
0 A:  Yes.  I have been there.
1 A:  feel like the home cooking places, are, are the healthiest meals.  You
0 A:  sorry I did not have ice cream to fall back on.
0 B:  Yeah.  My, uh, my brother tried to make, uh, a bunch of things, uh, way
1 A:  And, uh, my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And, uh, it's amazingly satisfying.
0 any protein, it's mostly starch.  So, it fills you up and then the cheese has
0 B:  Then you have to make a salad or,
1 A:  Yes, [laughter] and have an explosion. 
0 supposed to make a, a toffee like substance for a pie by, uh, boiling
0 evaporated milk three hours, and it does turn to toffee inside the can.
0 the place.  It was on the ceiling, on the walls and me.  And, and the boy

0 B:  Yeah.
1 like, he came from San Francisco and he had a very sophisticated taste.  I, I
0 a memorable evening anyway.
1 A:  Yeah, yeah we went there, well actually I went there before I got married.
0 B:  I agree.  I mean if I'm going to go on vacation, I want to lay out in the

0 Cayman Islands.
0 uh, you just pretty much go wherever you want to go and they had great summer 
0 you really save a ton of money and I would love to do that.
0 B:  Well our tenth anniversary is coming up #in October,#
1 A:  Um, Australia and down in there.  I mean the, the pictures I've seen of
0 wonderful stories of the island and, and the pictures she showed us and all

1 B:  No, neither am I.
1 Diego. 
1 B:  How do you work in a business trip? [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] You'll have to ask Bill how my business trips work [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
1 A:  And I have definitely needed a business trip lately [laughter].
0 B:  That would be all right.
1 B:  I guess we're straying from the, uh,
1 A:  Yes [laughter].
1 B:  the vacation part of it [laughter].
1 A:  Tha-, I mean a trip is a trip [laughter] so,
0 B:  Well [sigh] eventually I might but Archie offered me a ticket.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  And drinks.
1 A:  Oh yeah! [laughter].
1 A:  Oh yeah.
1 B:  That was something.

0 A:  Right.
1 picture, uh, how much we are willing to, to put out for, to have teflon on our,
1 on our, on our cooking pans and [laughter] (( )).
0 enormous amount of money to put that up, yeah, put something up like a space
0 {conversation begins to fade} unless they're going to [/talking] turn out
0 A:  She didn't announce that to you?  
1 A:  Oh, I see.  That's fine.  Um, I think, uh, that's pleasurable for all of
1 us, [laughter] if we choose the right restaurant [laughter].
0 @B:  Well, I, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than
1 inside of a place that we drove up and I was like, I'm not eating in there
1 [laughter].
0 B:  Are you nuts?  And, uh, we went in and it was the m-, it was the most
1 B:  -- uh, was to Atchafalaya.  No, that's not right.  
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Yes.  
1 A:  Okay.  
0 B:  Oh, really?  Why?   
0 whatever.  They use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver
0 B:  Oh, my goodness.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Health food, uh, restaurants that, 
0 B:  uh, I don't know how expensive they are.  It sounds like that it would
0 probably,
1 A:  Yes.  
1 A:  Yes, uh-huh.  
0 B:  [Sniffing].
0 B:  then maybe.  
1 broiled chicken breast and it was exce-,
0 A:  I know they say that, 
0 B:  Oh, really.
1 A:  I,
1 B:  because I'm probably not going to stop eating it [laughter]. 
0 A:  Corrode.
0 holes in them to sink them.
1 B:  You can't get away from it so I think,
1 know.
1 B:  That doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial.
0 A:  [Laughter] Well, it seems to be in the current situations [noise] but,
0 A:  Oh, definitely.  Any, any crimes against person, 
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  That's a,
0 A:  Well, it's just an, an example.  I think there's, uh, someone that's on
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  And, you know [laughter], 
0 the)) cost,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  There are more, 
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  I think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that
0 B:  They may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
1 also designed to line the pockets of lawyers.
1 A:  Oh, yes [laughter].
1 a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had [laughter] some statute
1 of limitations on lawyers [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] Yes.  
1 B:  I hope you're not a lawyer [laughter].
1 A:  No, I'm not a lawyer [laughter].
0 have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public
1 B:  And that just, that really does ruffle my feathers, 
1 A:  Again one of our --
1 cooking whatever they have to cook every day.
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Oh, that's nice.  
1 do these really elaborate gourmet meals.
0 A:  Well, we try, I mean, because you know everybody is so active with their
1 kids and all that.  It's like, you know, if we can do it once every six
0 months, we're doing well [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, yes, yes.  
1 A:  Yeah.  So, I mean we originally started out, you know, when we were younger
0 A:  -- and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids.  Um, then we
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 time we got around, uh, to each of us and it was time again, we were almost
1 tired, you know.
0 much time for, uh, regular entertaining, but, um, uh, uh, when, when we
1 B:  because depending on who your guests are.  
0 B:  Uh, so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese.
0 that, that really limits,
0 A:  It sure d-,
0 B:  Oh, wow.  
1 and I'm glad [laughter] we don't have it every,
0 A:  in the backyard and the,  
1 buying cold cuts [laughter].
1 A:  Martha Stewart, you know.  
1 tablecloths and,
1 A:  and time to, you know, sh-, t-, 
0 really do.  Everything, all parts of the food, I mean --
0 B:  Oh, they do.  I-, it's very difficult to purchase, um, [lipsmack] items
0 wonderful cakes.  Uh, they, fresh str-, strawberry cheesecake now and, and so
0 on.
0 is really not such a bad price.  I decided I, I just couldn't quite make
0 interesting, uh, it's out there if you want to pay the price but,
1 just gain weight going by the door,
0 B:  [Laughter]  Right, 
1 A:  Doing little hors d'oeuvre things that, I have a kick making that, I mean,
1 It just --
1 B:  Right.  You don't sound like you're from Texas originally though.
1 A:  Oh, I'm not.  Thank you for noticing [laughter]. 
1 A:  I'm from Chicago.   
1 A:  of Virginia I'm, 
1 A:  and everything is a long story.  But,
0 always complicat-,
1 B:  and so we, we rea-, I really enjoy cooking.  Um, I like desserts and, uh,
1 B:  Yeah, yeah.  
1 A:  I can, I can bake [laughter]. 
0 B:  Um, do you get that magazine?  
1 don't know what this is [laughter] going to taste like [laughter].
1 B:  Right.  
1 and take home,
0 When I look at a recipe there's ingredients that I don't like,
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Oklahoma.  
1 ingredients sometimes that I'm just like, I don't even know what that is
0 moved down to Texas.  And I had,
1 B:  once a week.  
1 A:  [Laughter].   
1 they knew,
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  all these things [laughter] my kids are eating [laughter].  
1 B:  Oh, really?  
0 A:  No.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  It is good.  It is good, and it's called Cajun Magic.   
0 B:  you could probably sh-, you know.  I buy, I buy it at Albertson's.
0 items --
0 B:  Easy,
1 B:  I have a daughter who will eat everything.  
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 said, [whispering] Mom, they had the most wonderful dinner it was Hamburger
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  And it's delicious [laughter]. 
0 they brought a recipe that went with the bottle of wine.
1 A:  And one of my girlfriends brought a really nice bottle of wine and she had
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  
1 know.
0 A:  Well, 
0 A:  desserts are definitely a weakness.  But, uh, 
0 something.  It's a white chocolate mousse cake --
1 B:  Oh.  
0 cakes.
0 B:  cake.  Oh, I love apple cake or spice cake something like that.
1 B:  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is.  
1 A:  Well, I'm getting hungry now [laughter]. 
0 A:  Huh. 
1 reading the things and they said, you know, checkoff different categories that
0 B:  Have you not eaten yet tonight?  
0 A:  and so, 
0 B:  was your cholesterol that high?  
0 A:  It was two forty and I'm only twenty-nine years old.  
1 B:  Really?  
0 B:  Is two forty really that high though?  
0 A:  It is for, for me and my age bracket.  
1 B:  Now, this is not SOUTHERN LIVING.  
1 A:  Yeah [laughter]. 
0 B:  Um, they have lots and lots of, of, uh, cookbooks --
1 I'm going to do all this wonderful,
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  And then I'm like, give me the blue cheese dressing.
0 B:  Have you, have you tried,
1 A:  like Oprah Winfrey says, every once in a while you've just got to have
1 B:  Oh.  
0 B:  Yeah, and does it take, have you tried that?  Is it terrible?
0 B:  Right.  
0 fees.  They just call them fees, and there's a fee for everything.
0 we,
1 noticed Bridgeport, Connecticut's declared bankruptcy.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  But they, it's the rank and file.  They never talk about cutting at the
0 A:  There's no,
0 A:  Um, yeah.  
0 B:  I've always thought that.  
0 A:  and there's the prison population is skyrocketing -- 
0 A:  -- uh, I think they should probably go back and borrow some of, uh,
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  worth a, worth a damn. 
1 second one,
1 I've developed an interest in watercolor.  So I'm taking some classes over at
0 B:  That sounds really interesting.  My husband does, uh, painting he's been
0 hanging in people's houses that I look at now and I go, oh, I can do so much
1 better than that.
1 know, it's, it's an interesting thing and I really do like it.  It's real
1 A:  Um, no, because I can't get beyond making this first quilt. 
1 A:  I'm afraid [laughter] if I make another one, I'm keeping it, you know
0 of thing.
1 know, scraps of this and that.  And that's getting to be a real art form what
1 you wear on your back, so [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  and I called, I think I called Michael's and Zak's both.  And as it
0 turned out the month that I called, they didn't have anything.  And then I
1 B:  save yourself some money on some of the flower arrangements. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Some of them I'll just, uh, well, years ago when I was sewing
0 B:  You know, assorted buttons.  And, oh, sometimes you got ten of a kind
0 pretty.
0 A:  And it's, they're all wooden buttons.  It's really neat.  And she says
1 B:  I guess that hasn't hit in Dallas yet.  I haven't seen any of that
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, I know [laughter].  This is, this is mid-state Illinois I don't know
0 A:  Oh.  
1 B:  Because I think I had about fourteen to do.  
0 B:  And, uh, ((I got)), I'll, I'll either be working on this constantly or I'm
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  uh, bows and everything.  It's strictly been painting so far, 
0 A:  Oh, ((well, sure)).  
1 B:  The only problem is I've done so many I don't know when I want to touch
1 another sweatshirt again [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Well, Christmas is only six months away now [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, I know I better get started, right?  [Laughter].
1 A:  Right.  I, [laughter] the year goes so fast it's, 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Well, thanks for calling.
0 the best.  However, I haven't been to a baseball game in years, but I have
1 A:  You know and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point, and then
0 they kind of fell on their face [laughter].
1 B:  Right [laughter].  
1 B:  Oh, it's amazing.
1 B:  Right.
1 newspaper at work, and when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper.
0 B:  quite a bit of speech work.  
0 A:  Well, that's good.  Well, that's interesting.  And the topics are
1 A:  Um, you know, uh, it's such a rugged game that it, uh, uh, it seems to be
1 too physical for my, uh, interest [laughter].
1 ever had a son, he would not play football.  And, uh, I had four daughters
0 A:  but I think the, they happen more in football.  I think the odds are cut
0 A:  ratio of injuries in baseball.
0 less,
0 A:  A love for them.   
0 B:  No, I'd, well, I, I, uh, always been quite an athlete and doing different
1 B:  My God.   
0 of, uh, recognition from the, uh, uh, the bowling league, I guess.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 wasn't there for the game.  I liked to as a, as a method of, uh, entertainment
1 A:  fellowship but outside of that, no.  I didn't.  And I, and I still, I
1 like to bowl, but, uh, [lipsmack] I don't have, uh, Jack [laughter] standing
0 behind me to tell me what to do [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  I,
0 A:  Yeah, is the one year old a boy?  
0 A:  Uh, I guess, uh, what I see is so far as, uh, the trends, uh, uh, for
0 A:  you can't let them grow up the way, the way I grew up, you know.  I, I'm
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 whatever, it just, know more when they get, you know, to be five or six or
0 B:  Uh-huh.  One thing is I got a home computer too and, uh, I play, uh, with
0 B:  And given, 
0 B:  you know, uh, or, there's a little soccer thing that he's going to do for
1 A:  [Laughter] I can't imagine th-, them having as much fun as the parents,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 really soccer it's just kind of a, well, kick the ball around for a while,
1 A:  Right, yeah [laughter].
1 A:  The, the disorganized play (( )) really what it was, but,  
0 A:  but, uh, yeah, when ours was a, he, I guess he was probably five or six,
0 it's, a lot of the problem is to, you know, you always have the lack of funds
0 A:  with the civil rights program.  Not that the civil rights program is bad
1 B:  Georgia.  
1 time very rich with sound.  Uh, but I think I'd stick back with my Beethoven
1 never really, uh, listened to it.  I mean because that's just, it was, it
0 little, you would discover that it has a lot of roots from the, both from the
1 B:  Well, there's some joy in it also.  
0 A:  Oh, okay, I, I must admit that's, yeah, they're fantastic, so, uh, uh,
1 B:  Reba McIntire is a little too country for me.  
1 A:  Well, I guess I, I have listened in on some of the stuff and not really
1 B:  Oh, yes.  
0 A:  Uh, uh, how about the Oak Ridge Boys.  
1 B:  That's true.  
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Yeah, so, I mean, it, it, it'll, if it stands the test
1 the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still and, and, uh, you know,
1 B:  Right.
0 B:  -- this short.  
0 A:  Oh.  Uh, what recourse do you think a company would have then if they had
0 A:  Protection?  
0 A:  Do you,  
1 B:  -- if you suspect it, that you should have some kind of proof, not, not
0 of the purposes, I think, of the Constitution which, you know, which says, you
0 know, you don't have to give self-, incriminating evidence.
0 B:  -- I still, I think it still fits, you know, the same, uh, somewhat anyway,
0 they feel that this is mo-, the most direct way and painless way of, uh,
0 yet.  But, of course, the men, I guess it's more pop-, and I don't know if
0 A:  But,  
0 B:  -- as there are men.  
0 A:  I don't know anybody, uh, in even a random, uh, friendship that uses drugs.
0 B:  -- or, you know, that kind of -- 
0 B:  -- situation.  
0 B:  Do what?  A casual user?  
1 with --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 that, that have started the, the, the non voluntary drug testing and --
0 A:  Uh-huh.

0 garden, an, an, an outside garden, which is very unusual there.
0 A:  So she was a horticulturist, and that was sort of her dream.

0 series of answers.
0 B:  How many children do you have?

0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 church and my kids do an awful lot with that.  Allyson sings in the choir.  I
0 that's real neat.

0 states.
1 out of smoking even.

0 [laughter].
0 tapped into.
0 B:  I mean, you know, he just,
0 A:  Right, so you worked, you learned how to solve your problems on your own.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 concerned are absolute saints, because in second grade, it was about the

0 A:  that's great for parents to be involved.
0 first report card comes in, they,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yes.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  and if they're a behavior problem, they're out.
1 A:  -- and, uh, they come in and their attitude is, "I'm a bad boy," and
0 A:  they can be selective, right.
0 go on, like ours do.
1 A:  Right.
0 B:  Yeah, vehicles [/child_talking].
0 A:  uh, eighteen wheelers and so forth.

1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air.
0 B:  [/Music].
0 ramifications.
0 A:  really are.
1 B:  We really have to do more,
1 A:  So I think the cockroach will evolve, uh, sa-, safely [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  So at least they're moving that direction.
0 A:  Absolutely, yes.  Uh, of course, uh, we would like to see it accelerated

0 [lipsmack] land, you know, which, uh, we get our nutrients from.
0 A:  everything goes back to the land.
0 B:  Uh-huh [music].
0 A:  uh, get that through to the people and get us educated.
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, I think science has come a long way to making it so that it's
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  [/Popping]. 
0 A:  What grade level would that be? Would that be, um, perhaps,
0 B:  [/Popping]  I think they are starting probably in the first grade.
0 A:  Well, I'm sure that, uh, perhaps they're the leaders, you know, and other

0 tickets, [lipsmack] where I can pay for those, you know, you could --
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- on a card --
0 A:  Uh-huh {faint}. 
0 B:  What,
0 B:  Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't?  I've found some
0 taking credit cards, and so many of them don't anymore.
0 A:  Uh-huh {faint}.  
0 A:  I say wow, I, I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and
0 used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- it's not just paying back what you've charged, it's --
0 B:  Right.  
0 I can, I can do that.
0 B:  Right.  
0 those cards.
0 at each other every night going man, that will pay off like both of our
0 A:  Oh, right, right.  
0 B:  That's right.  
1 A:  -- because you're living on the other guy's money for a while. 
1 A:  But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride
0 A:  -- that is a good, healthy, safe use --
0 A:  -- of credit cards.  
0 B:  Because you know that's coming back to pay it off.  
1 A:  I ((said)) for crying out loud, if I had the money to in-, you know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay
0 off, so we cut that out real quick [laughter].

0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yeah.  I think that the, I think what, I mean, I don't know what happened
0 A:  Right, and, and I don't quite know why it failed.  Um, I would bet the

0 for --
0 B:  It would be difficult, but it would not be as difficult for people, say,
0 I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll
1 A:  But I wonder if, if,
1 B:  So all the dieters would be happy [laughter].
0 B:  I only weigh sixteen today.  That's,

1 A:  That's right.  
0 you know.
0 B:  all that began back there, and I think they're the only part of the
1 [laughter] measuring system that would [laughter],
1 A:  Let's see, how many cups equal that?
1 A:  That's all I know.
0 A:  I, I learned that because, uh, a friend of mine, I, I had two friends, and,
1 I had more friends than that, but two friends of mine in college,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 remember a pint is a pound the world around, and ((he got)) the measuring cup

1 A:  Yeah, you have to --
0 A:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but I still notice a lot of not necessarily prejudice, but
1 I work with a, um, some men that are very chauvinistic still.
0 B:  Right.
0 and a nephew now, and my nephew is seven years old, and something was said
1 about my niece being a doctor, and he said, Well, she can't be a doctor, she
1 can only be a nurse [laughter].
1 [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] Well, and probably, probably he hasn't seen any female doctors.
0 A:  Oh, really.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 that that was what I was told to do, or, or whatever, it simply, that's what I
1 A:  Yeah, yeah, my daddy was a, that was his, I guess, second profession.  He
1 A:  And, um, it was really neat, because she totally reworked this, the story
1 about Cinderella, um, met, worked her way to this ball, and then [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, she left her calling card in the form of a glass slipper and
1 B:  [Laughter] Very creative.  
0 about fairy tales, that they really do leave that impression, I'm sure with a
0 B:  And then one of our V P -s shared what, what are some of the things that T
0 I is doing to, um, come up with some similar results.
0 young --
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  I can only think of one out of all the people that I've talked to, so,
0 A:  Right.
1 B:  Yeah, but there are other options that are available.
1 A:  Oh, yeah, well, um, I lost my train of thought [laughter].
1 B:  I'm sorry [laughter].
1 wimpy that you can understand why men get frustrated with them,
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 A:  Okay,
1 B:  Um, we pay the necessities first and, uh, then, from there, if there's
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  When we have some money, we'll do that [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- and we do a lot, get a lot of things used, and the things that we do
0 I'll look at it and think, What else can I do with this --
0 B:  -- even a little closer.
1 A:  -- that's a good thing.  
0 A:  -- don't need any more and stuff, but, uh --
1 B:  -- and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle.
0 B:  That's right.
0 A:  That's kind of the same thing for me.  I have to not know that it's
0 A:  Is it a pleasure for you, or are you,
0 B:  Year, I've been running since high school --
1 months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and --
0 A:  Right, that's, I never got past that stage.
0 B:  -- so that pays also.
0 B:  -- and you can actually get a good wo-, you can, I know in the push up, at
0 B:  Right.
1 A:  -- and I can't sleep, I'll get up --
0 A:  It's, I guess, pretty, pretty healthy, but I don't have a regular plan,
1 between, uh, when you, when you add something to your life, when you add a
1 mornings, what am I, what do I trade it off for.  Well, the answer's --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah, you too.  Have a nice day.
0 chicken dish --
0 A:  I've heard, you know, I've heard a lot of people say, it, the short cut on
0 A:  I cook, guess I cook a, seems like I cook a lot of dinners, oh, not always
1 A:  But a time consuming place.
0 B:  -- and you, uh, for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some,
0 A:  Gosh,
1 B:  {Spoken off phone}.  What you want.  {Back to phone} wh-, where do they get
0 it?  [Laughter].
0 A:  Okay, well,
0 extra lemon and just squeezed across the top and it really stayed longer than
1 difference,
0 and a package of jello and a thing of, uh, like Cool Whip --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such.
0 A:  -- and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried
0 A:  I think normal's about sixty or seventy.
1 dwindling, for one thing.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 Temple, and he has a large family, so it's, it's fun when we go to that one.
0 A:  That's just too far away.
0 A:  And it takes a lot of planning,
0 B:  And choose,
0 B:  That's a heavy burden.
1 A:  Yes, it is, I tell you.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  No [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] But that is, uh, it's, it's a lot of work, but it's a lot of
1 A:  Oh, yes,
0 teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that,
0 you know, and then expect them to pick it up at school, you're not going to do
0 that's, that's, that's another root problem.
0 A:  Right,
0 A:  Well, I think it's, like you say, it's, it's the socioeconomic mix there,
0 lot of kids who are basically, uh, that might be more well to-, well off, you
0 B:  Yeah.
0 are going to a public parochial school like that, it's, it's because the
1 B:  Yeah, I mean, and what do you, what would you do to fix the school systems?
0 @A:  I don't have a set budget.  I just [laughter] know what I have coming in
1 it would come out to that [laughter].
0 B:  And then I add them up at the end of each month so I do know exactly what I
0 A:  Uh-huh, do you --
0 A:  -- do you kind of forecast yourself for the year or not, make a forecast of
0 what you think your expenses and then compare what the actual costs are?
1 work for the year, it doesn't have all these extra things on it that
0 our shower redone, you know.
0 A:  Was your shower pan out of kilter?
1 B:  -- and then the next time it was termites, and then this time I think it
0 was just some kind of a leak [laughter].  But anyway.
1 would blow them over --
0 than down here because of the snows and winters and everything.
0 A:  They're not even using, um, a pure wood produc-,
0 B:  I guess so many people don't know that much about construction that they
0 A:  I, I just, um, it's just, it's ridiculous.  I just feel very, very
0 B:  #have to do,#
1 A:  Yeah, I know it.
0 to, you know, pay it off --
0 A:  Is that,
0 A:  -- and, um, about, I guess about when the first, when the youngest one was
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I recently stopped by McDonalds, and I was sitting out in their little
0 A:  Yes, yes,
0 B:  Absolutely,
0 B:  That's right.
0 simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- you know, taking care of a whole building --
0 to be involved in their school, because I want to be the one --
0 could help direct their, their learning experiences and their development.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 B:  -- to develop the kinds of things that, that they're going to need to
0 interact with other people, I felt like I needed some strong influence there.
1 sign up for the P T A?  And he said, Mom, don't do that to me,
1 B:  please don't do that to me.  So I knew it was time to go back to work.
0 eight, three or four months and then bring them back to her --
0 B:  -- but, that's the only bad experience I had, the rest of the time they
0 particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the Y
0 it very much any more.  I used to use it quite a bit.
0 B:  I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.  I do some P C stand
1 B:  Loaners from work?
1 B:  I'm jealous.
0 A:  -- [Laughter] and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible, it's a
0 A:  -- in Washington, and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while.
0 stuff typically for other people, and we, like here we use the P C -s to do
0 A:  -- and we don't have too much standard software.  Like I haven't bought, we
1 use it more for just writing programs when we need to or, um, doing research,
0 A:  Neither one,
1 start squawking.  So I finally [siren] opened up the box and took it out.
0 A:  In Manhattan.
0 people can hear.  So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked
0 can't even hear the phone call.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 related.
0 A:  Yeah, people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use.
0 B:  Um, I wouldn't say compatible, but --
1 B:  -- certainly comparable.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 responsibility.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 clarinet, and they end up playing a lot of the high notes, and I don't, I
0 B:  Um.  Well, I like it, I, I like the low instruments better, too.
0 David went, and he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets, and
0 phonetically}.  It's his house seat.  That's under his control, and he said it
0 was a great seat.
1 don't know.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  Oh, it's you know, really weird stuff, he likes, and I thought, Oh my gosh,
1 B:  So he listens to New Wave and you listen to the oldies.
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  -- but we have, I think, all his records so far, and all my brothers and
1 drug test employees and they don't like it, then they should not be employed
0 B:  I wish they would.
1 B:  -- to suspect someone, you know.  That, that's getting a little bit, that's
0 B:  Either just the lucky or the unlucky one, depending on how you look at it.
0 B:  To report it, and I guess you'd report that to a supervisor, maybe --
0 B:  -- they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something, but out on the
0 to, um, the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing --
1 thing, but I'm, you know, you know you don't, so it's not as big a deal, and
1 A:  Um, Sunday I went to see ROBIN HOOD, along with fifty million other people
1 so we ran down the road to another one,
0 with working and, and,
1 A:  And so, and there was a lot of action, lot of swashbuckling type of thing
1 [laughter],
1 A:  -- it doesn't hurt to sit and --
1 B:  -- needless to say, [laughter] really,
0 A:  No, I never went to see that one.
1 even be at the dollar movies.
0 A:  Oh, really, did you like that?
1 B:  In fact, uh, you know, it's one of those things that I want to see more
0 B:  That's about the airplane --
1 B:  Yeah, so we, we, uh, we'll, I watch and grab the first one that comes out.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  -- it tells you that you're a miracle and there's nobody like you, and
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  -- because I think it's a, it's a real excellent movie to sort of build
0 B:  -- and tell them that they can, they're individuals and they can do what
0 B:  Yeah, so.  Well, I think that, uh, that it sounds like that our lives run
1 [laughter].
0 A:  -- yeah, that don't have a lot of the blood and gore, because I just can't
1 A:  -- things like that, but some of the rest, yeah, I wouldn't go see SILENCE
1 OF THE LAMBS if I had to [laughter].
0 B:  Yes --
1 week.
1 A:  -- just on regular T V.
1 B:  Yes.
1 A:  Yeah, there's a lot --
0 A:  -- when we get home, and then the weekends there's always so much to do to
1 catch up from what you didn't do all week.
0 A:  So, really, I think Sunday going to see ROBIN HOOD was the first time I had
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] They really do.
1 A:  Or go to the Saturday afternoon cheap show [laughter].
0 I cannot really say that it's a formal budget, it's more just a, a pretty, uh,
0 a fairly, uh, accurate, uh, recording of what I spend,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  track of it.  
0 B:  -- that was put over there and, I mean, of course, he is from the
0 it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years.  Uh,
0 just, uh, fascinating to see how little things cost, I mean #it was,#
1 A:  #but, uh,# never the less it was fun to see those figures next to, you
0 B:  If people will pay two hundred then why charge #ten.# 
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 and I was, [sigh] I was really diligent about that.  I was putting money aside
0 A:  uh, that really paid off.  Because when time came for him to go back to
1 B:  Um.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  so we have had, uh, once again, you know, some really, a real lean year
0 B:  Yeah, with education #you can't,#
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  take that away from you.
0 in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it so --
0 A:  did it on our own but, uh, um, I, that sounds interesting.  Is your
0 A:  Fantastic.
1 restaurants here, there is some Cajun cooking and, of course, there is always
1 steaks [laughter].
0 B:  So, it is generally in that north side of town.
0 A:  Okay.
1 B:  It's not a fancy place.  I have eaten there at lunch primarily.
1 B:  Oh, that is hard to say, but the ones that we like most are out of business
1 now but (( )) [laughter].
0 continental style cooking.
0 B:  But that has been gone for several years now.
0 A:  Well, it is just a shame that all the restaurants that, you know, open and
0 B:  It's gone, right.
1 A:  I know they are everywhere, people eat out in Dallas, like I have never
1 seen [laughter].
0 A:  but I thought that since there is a new one opening, perhaps it would be
1 B:  Yeah.  That one is not re-, it's, it's a, it's a barbecue stand really.
0 It's not really a restaurant [laughter].
1 A:  Well, that's fine for the summer, but I do not think I would be too
1 B:  [Laughter]  Right.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  We had dinner there, we have a group of friends we go out once with, and we
0 A:  Well, you know how these restaurant reviewers are.
1 B:  It depends on whether they got comp the meal or not.
0 A:  #Bye-bye.#
1 B:  No, I do not.
1 A:  Yes, uh-huh.
0 A:  Okay.  And so we could, we could talk about, uh, that path, you know, how
0 coverage, uh, it provides and also, your hospital coverage, and, uh, um,
0 conglomerate or just a small, [inhaling] uh, uh, business.
0 B:  Yeah, I think any, any, even if your insurance policy is not the greatest.
0 A:  They are getting a handle on that, in fact, uh, my oldest daughter is, uh,
0 B:  And if they were in the same building --
0 A:  Do you think that would be,
0 B:  for the, for the people that would be using it, you know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Now, I would like to see betl-, better [noise] dental insurance to me.
0 [/noise] Was that our beep?
1 B:  Okay.
0 B:  because on, on a lot of the dental insurance, they do not cover that
0 A:  Yes, that's true.  Orthodontic work is terribly expensive.
0 his pallet is squared, not rounded.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, gosh.
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  to myself than make my five year old [laughter] go in and do it.
0 somewhere.  Someplace that's very different than Texas.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And, uh, and then actually, north, north of that is another town and, a
0 it's, the place where we stay is, we usually stay at the same place every
1 hundred dollars for the week.
0 A:  Oh.  [laughter] That's nice.
0 B:  Yeah, it really is, because, uh, the, uh, you know, it has got its own
0 A:  Oh, nice.  
0 B:  stay there sometime.  
0 A:  Oh.
0 A:  Well, we are, the neighborhood that we live, they are switching to an
0 alternate calendar this year, so it, starting, well, starting at the end of
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  yeah.  So, [noise] it's [noise] so, anyway, so maybe, maybe within a
0 sitcom wise, I like, uh, MAJOR DAD, [sigh] I'm in the, I'm in the Navy so I
1 kind of, you know, can associate, even though he's a Marine officer.
1 fan, is the, the ones that I do watch is, uh, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, --
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Yeah #[laughter].#
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  on versus, uh, having the channel changed on me because they want to watch
0 B:  #Yeah.#
1 B:  Certainly more educational then WHEEL OF FORTUNE [laughter].
1 B:  Seven seems enough [laughter].
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 it, the word of mouth, uh, of people talking to each other can cause a program
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  [Children].
1 B:  it's I think the comparison is like baseball managers this year.  They seem
1 to, uh, say, two weeks in, uh, you've had your chance time to, uh [laughter],
1 spend it watching,
0 A:  #You mean the crimes# or the punishment should fit the crime?
1 A:  #Okay# [Lipsmack].
0 B:  that can hold up what I consider the proper sentencing,
0 A:  Could you hang on one minute Jim?
0 B:  Yes ma'am.
1 A:  I am so sorry to keep you on hold.
0 B:  [Laughter] No problem.  
1 B:  Yes.
0 B:  had came up with the maximum sentence --
0 A:  Yes.
1 A:  #It seems like (( )),#
0 underhanded, uh, things going on that the public are not aware of.
0 B:  Yeah {very faintly}.
0 B:  Well, I think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have
0 B:  [Noise].
0 B:  So, then, uh, 
0 enough, they will listen to the voice of the people.  I have found that out.
0 #acquainted# --
1 A:  Yeah. Yeah.
1 A:  Well, I am too.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Well, uh, ho-, how do you view this whole subject?  
1 made, though.
1 A:  Yes, [laughter] oh, yes, I think so.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah I work for T I.
1 B:  Uh, I guess there's more women in, uh, what would be classified as a man's
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But we have got more women in it now.
1 B:  Uh.
1 A:  Right.
1 A:  #Maybe not, huh.#
0 A:  So, I was in a lot of classes where, uh, there, I was either the only
0 uh, in my work, I, I became a technical writer.
1 B:  [Throat_clearing].
0 A:  but I think they have got a long way to go [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah,
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  In, uh, you know, in protestant congregations and, uh, it will be
1 interesting to see if, if Roman Catholicism ever, uh, recognizes women in,
1 A:  No, probably not.  Huh-uh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 have, uh, a man doing some of these jobs than a woman.  I thought, well, at
1 B:  There's some men out there that are more feminine than most women
1 [laughter].
0 B:  #And, you know,# if she wanted to go to combat, 
1 B:  I do not see that they should stop her.  I personally would not want to
1 A:  I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I
1 A:  a little more assertive, than I think I was [laughter].  So, that's,
1 that's progress, I guess [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.  Well,
0 A:  Yeah, well, 
1 A:  Financially painful, anyway.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I, I have chosen to stay at home,
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 Mom, please do not be involved.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  there's not a lot of physical labor,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  [Inhaling].
0 B:  otherwise, I will guard [inhaling] their ability to have quiet time.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And it's been real busy.  And actually, today is really the first, as far
1 with sitting and being bored,
0 B:  if you thinking internally,
0 B:  They,
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 I,
0 solves all problems.  They,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 mediation,
0 cousins children.
0 they may not be real quality time [laughter] but, 
0 little more active than a cartoon.
1 theater and we are the only adults, you know,
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  and we spend money [laughter].  But, MILO AND OTIS is good and I think
0 B:  Um, that sounds cute.  Well, we had one silly movie that we used to watch a
0 used to watch that with her kids.
1 B:  Some [breathing],
1 on TV.  uh, Six Flags looks wonderful.  And we took them there and then they
1 A:  Oh, so you got to walk around and watch everything.
1 pitch voice}.
0 you going to take us to Six Flags, I want to go to Six Flags.
0 A:  social lives kind of flow around where,
0 B:  Uh.
0 know, been single all these years and, or you know, we have been married and
0 B:  Or, I came from a family that I had a very bad childhood, and I do not know
1 part if that's how they truly feel.  Not, you know, everybody [noise] saying
1 when are you going to have kids [laughter].
1 A:  #Right, or you do not know# any better, or there's nothing available
1 of situation there, she had brothers and sisters that kind of like pushed her

0  
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 need.
0 they will put them down on the floor and they will have on-, I think one of

0 A:  and ((so every days)) are different.  
1 another one coming in September, and I, it would, if they were where I could
1 A:  Incredible, but you know, since this is, people before they get pregnant
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 A:  Yeah, well she's, my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet,
0 now.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  But,
1 B:  They, they adjust to what the parents (( )) [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 seen it in their generation.  It, what you do is first see your parents go
0 through it with their parents.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 children, if not several are, uh, uh, back in the area where the parents, uh,
0 but it's something that we all face.
0 A:  Right.  And, of course, one thing we have not even discussed that makes a
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  That sounds neat.
1 B:  Well at least you have weekends off.
1 A:  Huh.  Well eventually, my husband thinks that we are going to sell
1 A:  [/Laughter] Yeah, I think we would kill each other [laughter].
0 port every once in awhile.  And say see you later and take off, and he said
1 B:  Who cares about sanity though.
1 A:  [Laughter] Well I know, what could make you insane floating around in the
0 on the weekends, at least, [inhaling] we are forced to talk to each other and
1 A:  Oh, yeah, it's a lot of fun [noise].  My husband has a wet suit, so he can
1 ski pretty much year around, if he, if he [noise] has the guts to [laughter].
0 nice and clean.
0 B:  I thought.
1 and said, okay [laughter].
0 B:  [Breathing] Yeah and I know it.
0 A:  It's pretty nice, it's nice to have.  It's a good way to get away, Kyle is
0 afraid that, he does not want me to, to pull it by myself yet, but the way our
0 A:  there's like a forty-five degree turn, so I do not think I could get it
1 B:  Something, a hundred twenty --
0 B:  -- a hundred twenty, a hundred fifty a month, 
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].
1 and there was a marina for sale, and he said now that would be a fun job
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, you know, hang out the gone fishing sign [laughter].
0 had any problems.  So, but Kyle is real good with the maintenance, I think
0 A:  Well just the minor stuff.  Uh, we,
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  That's true.  
0 A:  So, that's fine, I can live with that.
1 B:  Took it in and got it's, got all of its shots, right.
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].
1 A:  It's kind of like our only child now.
1 A:  [Swallowing] Yeah, really.
0 B:  It helps.
0 B:  Oh, did you?
0 B:  Where did you go?
0 A:  Um, I would want them to make that decision and I would, you know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  but yet close enough if I ever wanted to go home, I could.
0 A:  So I had to look for something that I could afford economically.
0 year.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  No, no not yet, I am moving shortly, so I am not looking around here.
1 B:  Do you have friends there or,
1 B:  Oh, I see.  Oh, the big company.
0 So,
0 B:  But I am not originally, I am originally from Illinois, but, you know, I
0 uh, I think, you know, financially, I am, there's only so much I can do for
0 because I felt it was mine and I could do with it what I wanted.
0 you know,
0 A:  It was just harder, you know, (( )) I do not know, I was used to being, you
1 not, they did not take it very serious.  I know I took it real serious, because
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 they would do a lot better.  Because they are more focused.
0 B:  Yeah, I think, I think you are right, when you pull yourself away and then
0 enough, did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest.  It
0 A:  Challenges.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 know,
1 B:  -- uh, in the church.  So, basically that's, that's, well I am done
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change, why they
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And, uh, I think that we are going to be, uh, on par with them --
0 A:  And, uh, I think our problems would be fewer, 
0 A:  Uh.
0 is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life
0 time.  But, when he gets angry, it's always over control issues, it's always
1 even if they want to, they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss
0 B:  Huh.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh, it would be.
1 B:  How many, you said yours are all, I mean, that sounds like an army.
1 B:  Oh, lord.
0 B:  Well, I kind of decided that single, single children that, that, that's not
0 parenting, that's a hobby.
0 B:  [Noise] {it sounds as if speaker B is washing dishes}.  Well I, I, I can
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  You can tell.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
1 B:  and plot and scheme and everything else. 
0 A:  Well, we did not do it right all the time [laughter].  With our first boy,
0 life is [laughter].  And I really wish we would have let him go where he wanted
0 right now, of course, he's, he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut
0 and they build and rebuild non jet engines.
1 retired from the state.
0 B:  And there really, there really was not a choice, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  [Inhaling] If I had known how, not, I am not going to say easy, but how
1 B:  and put into someplace else where,
0 B:  It's very different.
0 A:  See that's the way we are, we are more of a rural type of an area and it
0 A:  And so, in the long run, if it's really what they want, you know, they are
0 several, there have been several things that have happened where I felt like
0 if I had been involved in it I would have had to, to go along with, with that
0 B:  There have been some things, you know, there's things done that are just
0 B:  [Throat_clearing] But, it's something that's really [inhaling] hard to
0 and extensions and,
0 B:  Continuance,
0 A:  It's, 
0 be a limit on how many appeals can be made.
0 A:  A time limit too.  
0 B:  ((ha-,)) Yeah, 
0 times.  To have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and
0 the person could be rehabilitated.  But, I think just out and out murder, and
0 person has done it over and over again, in a serial fashion or whatever [TV].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  needs to addressed in, in, in that context [TV].
0 graduated from high school here, and they had told their teachers that wh-, I
0 and had to make the decision could I.  And I like to think I could, like you,
1 B:  Marilyn, it's Angela.  
1 interesting and then I subscribe, I bet you know what this one's going to be,
0 it's [door] interesting reading and, believe it or not, there are a few
0 be something that just catches my eye and I'll go ahead and buy it.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  I been --
1 B:  I,  
1 A:  -- reading all the stuff about Ken-, Kennedy [laughter].  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  You know.  So, uh, okay, so, does your mother still take PEOPLE magazine?
1 B:  They didn't renew their subscription because of [laughter] that.
0 A:  And, and it's, it's more, and I can think, more people do, I think just
0 tips in it and stuff like that.  Maybe the, the other one, there's one out
1 B:  Oh, okay.
1 A:  -- I don't have that many benefits per se [laughter].
0 B:  But, but, on the other hand, one of these days you'll be out looking for 
0 A:  I've, I've, I've, I've discovered.  I mean, even in my case it's sort of,
0 medical, they, they force you to buy here.  Now I'm covered by my wife's
0 the H M O for my business, they could, in, in theory, be getting paid twice
0 for the same thing.  But they're not, thank God.  Uh, but anyway, uh,
0 period or something, but, anyway it works out as I remember basically to, uh,
0 gets, you know, about two weeks a year, I guess --
0 are for comp time kinds of --
0 one hour --
0 actual vacation time per year probably isn't that, isn't that much different,
0 passed on to you, so --
0 B:  Yeah, uh, and, but it, but it's the, the same, the effect is the same as
0 A:  Right.  
0 A:  Right.  
1 A:  Oh, we haven't seen that one yet.
1 B:  Well, don't bother [laughter].
0 far as women go.  Uh, it was, it was entertaining, but, yeah, I don't think
0 B:  -- two hour or,  
1 B:  Uh-huh.  Okay, okay.  
1 A:  We, we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] That always seems to happen when you rent them, you know
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, and, uh, it,   
0 B:  Was it, oh, good.    
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Okay, okay, good deal -- 
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 to have on a weekend, you've got to rent it on Thursday.
1 B:  Right.  
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah, right, right.  
1 A:  Most of them are a coin flip [laughter].  
1 B:  [Laughter] Oh, gosh.  Yeah, yeah.  And we usually have, oh, [breathing],
0 we don't get out as much as we like.  We have two children, so we [laughter]
0 B:  Uh-huh.  What ages are they?  Have you found -- 
0 A:  Uh, generally try to stay in the at least P G range.  
0 attention.
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
1 A:  But the, the nine year old will watch anything that's on T V [laughter].
0 prosecutor in the, a woman prosecutor in there is murdered --
1 husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me, so I thought I better
0 B:  Yeah, because I think he'd like that one.  
0 [baby_crying] uh, FATAL ATTRACTION.
0 A:  -- so you know all the story and who did what --
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh [baby_crying].  
0 B:  I don't think too many of them are anymore.  It's, it's a shame, but, 
1 A:  I don't know, we've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S any number of times
1 B:  I know [laughter].  
1 A:  It's just slapstick comedy [laughter].  
1 B:  Oh, gosh.  
1 kinds of movies.
1 A:  Yeah, we like to laugh [laughter].  
1 B:  I agree, I agree.  
1 A:  Life's depressing enough [laughter].  
0 B:  That's for sure [laughter].  
0 A:  Okay, bye.  
0 B:  -- I hope you see a good movie soon.  
0 younger and that was, uh [laughter] quite a car.
0 just liked, uh, this particular car.  It was a good buy.  I got it through the

0 A:  Eighty-five, are you going to be looking again soon, or how long, do you
1 normally keep cars for a long time or, 
1 other expenses --
0 A:  Oh, my.  For what, almost six, well six years, huh.  
0 Chevy wagon and then a, a four year old, uh, Crown Victoria that I love

0 B:  [Laughter] You like Fords, huh.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Well, my husband's, my husband got to chose, choose the make
1 A:  -- and, before they started chopping it up and making it look ugly, so I,
1 a nervous driver we felt like she's probably better off in that [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, really?  
0 [laughter],
0 B:  You can fit, you can sit five people in it.  
1 A:  A lot of knee room in the back or,
0 B:  Just, you know, you can sit in there and it's, it's reasonably comfortable.
1 A:  Right, right.  
1 A:  So it,  
1 low,
0 A:  sports cars -- 
1 A:  Well, I've never been in one, so I, but I'm always wondering how on earth
1 B:  Yeah, to a little more of a reclining position.  
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  -- because I don't know where they're going [laughter].
0 A:  And it's got to be, you know you can't get your leg out and (( )), I
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  They don't ever show them getting in and out.  
1 B:  Yeah, right.  
1 A:  And I thought, that's the part I'd like to see [laughter],
0 where you can like when you're wanting to get out, you just turn it to the
0 B:  Huh.  
1 that, that little [noise] gutter, like it runs, so that when you open the door
0 A:  It doesn't have that, so when you open our car door, it comes.  The new,
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 help too much.
0 the side there.
1 B:  Well, you all don't get as much rain near Plano as we do here, I'll bet
1 [laughter].
0 A:  Well, I, I don't know [laughter].  We,   
0 B:  Huh?  
0 B:  Oh, I don't know, but we're way, we must be way above average this year
1 in there, but you always here how polluted with all the oil,
1 A:  It's not?  
1 A:  It's not?    
0 B:  Uh-huh.  It's just rain [laughter] [barking].  
0 A:  -- that doesn't affect,  
0 a friend come back from Colombia [talking].
1 A:  -- refinery blowing up or something like that.  
0 A:  You don't ever, I, I need to get down that way, I guess, sometime, when I
1 back they had all the limousines for such good buys.
0 A:  -- and you could pick one up -- 
1 of them.  So I thought well, that, I don't know, we even debated about that at
0 loved --
1 A:  But those aren't that new.  I mean I have some that were way old
1 B:  That's right.  But those are just real comfortable and, uh, you know, allow
0 B:  -- if it's split.  It, it varies, though, between the princ-, from one
0 B:  But I know of other schools where they wear, uh -- 
1 A:  -- and the wind caught my skirt and he said, when have you got on
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, it was real funny.
1 check on the length.  Well, we wear the knee-high ones a lot, too, so
1 not find any hose anywhere so,
0 A:  The one day that I did it and I got caught.   
1 B:  Uh, I've been here seventeen years.  
1 A:  Oh, well you qualify [laughter]. 
1 from the north that they have these heavy wool suits and it's like, God, what
1 B:  That really is nice.  I, uh, I'm kind of a pack rat especially when it
1 comes to clothes [laughter].
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  -- and should certainly get rid of probably all of them [laughter],
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 I take it out of the drawer and put it back in the box,
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 that I ever remember buying, and I only got to wear it like twice --
1 Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit dresses and they look at me like I'm strange, but
1 A:  Yeah, so.  My husband's kind of whiny.  He says, well I like the shorter
1 ones [laughter].
1 day long [laughter].
1 A:  So,  
1 out to play and you don't have any play clothes.
0 I haven't worn har-, very many of those things, but I was thinking, oh, well,
1 things I haven't worn --
1 B:  Oh, how nice!  [Laughter]. 
1 and put it in another closet in the guest bedroom because I'm so tired of
1 looking over it and it's all just a little bit too tight [laughter].
1 easily,
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  and I'll do something about it [laughter].  But, so far [laughter],
1 those, because, 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Oh, that's funny.
1 A:  Said well, we'll have to get a bigger house [laughter].  
1 they send their baby clothes and all their stuff down here to me, and I'm
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  I don't think it will fit my dog [laughter].  
0 B:  Yeah, you'll be glad, believe me.  
0 A:  Yeah, I'm sure I will be because, God, I was, in was in Foley's the other
1 A:  -- and I just picked up something for my niece and it was just, it was like
1 if they were,
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Anything was fine, but, you know, now it has to be a certain kind of, 
0 B:  certain kind of jeans and the, the shoes are just about the worst.
1 in March.  It was early March he bought them and they are demolished.
1 B:  The inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Oh, my gosh.  
1 B:  That's a hundred and eighty dollars a year,
1 A:  Maybe I won't have kids [laughter].  
0 dress shoes --
1 spending that amount of money on this pair of shoes.  He said, but I'll still
1 be wearing them in ten years [laughter].
0 B:  So, anyway -- 
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 and, uh, the main crimes within the suburb here are the, the theft crimes.
0 are more policemen --
1 A:  -- but that's which came first.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  You know, in a sense I don't, I'm n-, I have real mixed feelings on that --
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  You know, so that, but that was interesting, you know, I, I don't, crime is
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 the idea they can get something for nothing.  Of course --
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  -- uh, for mental duress or whatever.  
0 unacceptable.
0 A:  And, yeah, if you're going to drink, and you may drink, you better have
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Yep.  
0 musicians.  And one of his biggest struggles, uh, with the band was that this
0 A:  Oh {faint}. 
0 dad?
0 of things.  Uh, one of the regrets I have is that I grew up with a house
0 A:  But, uh, when you mentioned the band music, my son just started high school
1 part of the athletic department, rather than the music department.
1 A:  Oh [laughter]. 
0 A:  What, uh, my husband, Tim, played a trombone in high school and he also
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  A tuba.  
1 of the bell at the back.
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  But in marching season, he's easy to pick out [laughter].
0 A:  We, uh, [lipsmack] laughed when they're in sixth grade and they try them
1 suggesting that they ought to also find out what vehicles the parents drive
1 because [laughter],
0 A:  -- car.  
0 in, in, uh, Missouri at the time, and they actually drove to Colorado to buy
1 harp,
0 and as a result of that, he, well, that was part of the reason he ended up
0 after he did get out of college, it was not long he, before he, uh, just moved
0 A:  I was going to ask you and, it seemed that there must have been a big gap,
0 put the sense-, sentencings down.  I think the judges should, or even a panel
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  And so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was a,
1 people just sit on them once in their lifetime, you know, if they're that
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 in the newspaper, I, I tend to hear two things that, well, that go on.  One
0 A:  -- by a judge or an Appeals Court and that never makes the, the press and
0 so, when, uh, you or I as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain
0 are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop, though.  I believe it's
0 probably bought across the market.  And I don't think gun control is going to
0 B:  Uh, sort of a, a little bit of restriction, maybe, I might say.  If a, if a
0 anybody to wait a week --
0 B:  -- and if it is somebody like that, then, no, but I really think that most
0 B:  That's right.  Nobody over there carries guns.  
0 either so, 
0 A:  Well --
1 place and the firearm is in another.
0 of course, I'm like you.  I don't like to kill things.
0 B:  Well, it is terrible when you have ride down the street and think somebody
0 if it ever get to that point.
0 A:  -- if there were no firearms.  
0 B:  Not in this country.  
0 B:  Right.  
1 B:  Oh, m-, me, too.  
1 A:  Okay [laughter].  
0 A:  Substitute teacher.
0 B:  Oh, okay.  
0 some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, uh,
0 That's one of things, one of the things I ask about, you know, whether,
0 longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer.  And add a heavier jacket or,
1 outfits --
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember to
0 season, maybe all year long, they wear the school colors for, uh, game day --
0 A:  -- but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the
1 B:  And they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  Right.  
1 B:  And so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there, you
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  -- and, and that's hard.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well I, I think it would make a difference at school.  I, I don't
1 A:  And then the girls, 
0 atmosphere and you usually get good portions of food and stuff.  And, and, uh,
0 his company, you know, with his work --
1 hearty steak.
0 A:  But I, I find it amazing around here we don't have too many good steak
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- and, uh, then they have a big grill and you grill it yourself, you know,
0 know, I was really surprised, like I say, going at these fancier restaurants
1 B:  Because it's, uh, it's easier to go with two kids, two young kids, now
0 [laughter].
0 A:  -- which doesn't work with kids.  
0 B:  If they just get your order and go and you never see them again or they
0 A:  And do you find that when you have children that it's, it really makes, uh,
1 the way they treat you with kids?
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Well, sounds good.  
1 A:  No, I think we covered everything.  
1 B:  [Laughter] Okay, well thanks a lot.  
1 A:  Well, thank you for being home [laughter].  
0 years and then he went to, to DePaul in Chicago which would have been great,
0 B:  Well -- 
0 A:  Right.  
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  -- which was, you know, a million people go there -- 
0 A:  -- like Oklahoma.  
1 B:  Texas only had fifty-five thousand when I was there.  
0 the whole durn campus.
0 uh Oklahoma's good and Arkansas is good.
0 B:  -- I would go to any school except L S U.  
0 A:  Yeah.  And, uh, in fact she was accepted at two schools in Texas, uh, Rice
0 and, so, uh, she pretty much made that her-, herself, but she did have some
1 B:  Luckily I still have twelve more years to worry about it.  
0 dollars.
0 would just make it a rough figure of about, uh, with, with the travel expenses
1 A:  Uh, no.  
1 was opening every one of the mailboxes looking inside, 
1 A:  -- in that big fat grassy area.  And, uh, they had four thousand graduates
0 B:  Yeah, we went on the Blue Ridge Parkway last year -- 
0 A:  That really is, yeah.  
1 A:  -- identify someone, so.  I had to be very careful about talking about
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  -- so,
0 that.  If the, uh, the thing is, though, I, I didn't think even if it was a
1 lower conviction, I didn't think that you could, uh, I didn't think that you
0 B:  And we have so many people already, you know, the jails are already
0 A:  Well, the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous.  I mean if one
0 is determined that it's, you know, that he feels that he's, you know, going
0 against the other eleven, they all stay until everyone agrees.  So I don't
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, if it's, no, but they, they, what if they never agree.
0 A:  And they have to stay in until they all agree --
1 B:  Yeah, and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe, that's a
0 it.
1 B:  -- and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Now, I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or
1 but maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair
1 A:  Oh, oh, my God.  If there were more than twelve, can you imagine how long
1 they'd be sitting [laughter].
0 B:  Really, I've never seen one in real life either so I don't have, you know,
0 pretty fair system compared to other countries.  I don't know how we could
0 s-, a small infraction.  But I'm not sure who gets them [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 @@B:  So, how long do we need to talk? [Laughter].  Do you know?  
0 A:  No, I don't -- 
1 convenient for me to do it, but curbside would be much more convenient.
1 B:  Oh. 
1 A:  So, it was, I, I know it cut down on his work load, [laughter] but it's
1 also being helpful [laughter].
0 B:  Huh.  
0 A:  Yeah, we have plast-, at this center we have plastic, glass, aluminum and
1 A:  And I don't really care if I get paid for it, I just don't want it
1 B:  Oh, that's a good idea.  
1 A:  They think I'm nuts [laughter].  
1 little more aware of it, but, uh, they, uh, they laughed at me and brought me
0 forget, so,
1 it away.
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
1 B:  Uh, so until we get curbside service, we cart it all over --
0 so, 
0 A:  Huh.  
1 they throw their, uh,
1 get separate trash cans and tell them to put their trash in this one and the
0 they'll go along with it.
0 B:  Oh, that's great.  
0 B:  And you can put it back in your copy machine and just run it on through,
0 that you just buy the concentrate.
0 [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  But, so, that, you know, that's a real eye-opening, uh, activity to do,
1 well we're going to do cloth and everything, and then part way through, I, I
1 just [laughter],
0 I had gone to a small school growing up, uh, and a lot of my friends went to
0 A:  Oh, uh, my brother's in Austin.  Uh, he lives Lakeway.  He, uh, had moved,
0 A:  Is, uh, because you live in Austin, is she thinking about the University of
1 B:  She has her heart set on U T.  
0 a big university is like.  And, uh, one thing that I did this summer, which I
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Those, and those were several, uh, that we did consider.  Uh, my
1 B:  Well, then he should come to U T.  
1 A:  Yes [laughter].  
0 B:  Large classes.  
0 A:  Well, th-, that's certainly, uh, especially today with the cost of college.
0 B:  Oh, she, she has, uh, you know, interests that are just, you know, going in
0 married.  So I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake.  And
0 A:  Yes.  
0 A:  Yes.  
0 we've seen, you know, [breathing] uh, black people have a lot more civil
1 to be.  Used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or
0 visit, but it's not quite the same as, uh, what it was, say, twenty years ago,
0 thirty years ago.
0 A:  The majority, yeah.  
1 B:  -- at that time.  
0 A:  -- don't really care to go out and visit as much.  
0 B:  That's right.  
0 B:  Well, out of, out of fifteen grandchildren in my family, only two of us
0 B:  -- most people didn't go away.  I'm just one of the two --  
0 A:  Well, apparently there must be work available, for those -- 
1 B:  -- marry,  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yeah, well, even to get school finished, I think, a lot of times it's
1 better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in.  Because a
0 B:  -- the generation that's just now coming into -- 
0 B:  And so, you know, [/noise] it remained to be seen exactly what that, what
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Now, I'm going to baby-sit my granddaughter.  She's just eight
0 Maryland and one in Connecticut.  A son in Connecticut.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  That's worse yet.
1 B:  In fact I'm,  
1 A:  -- in the cage, okay.  
0 for, uh, [lipsmack], oh, six, seven, eight, eight years.
1 A:  Now do you just have one rabbit?  
1 A:  In other words, it never multiplied.  
0 A:  -- fifteen, and they died.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 Hound.
1 have a dog if I had a dog [laughter].
1 A:  Claw.  
1 A:  You can't say, come here.  I mean it just doesn't, you know, 
1 A:  Well, we have a humongous, uh,
1 back to you, you know.
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  -- to do is have an indoor dog.  
0 B:  Yeah, [breathing] yeah.  That's for sure.  
1 A:  -- my wife said uh-huh.  No, no. 
1 B:  -- objection.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yes.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Oh, that's good.  When we moved into this house, both dogs and cats had
0 moved in it was so bad that we had to go ahead and, uh, recarpet the entire
1 B:  And when they pulled the carpeting up, it was so bad on the back.
0 slab --
0 B:  -- took that, well, actually both.  
1 came back and then they put the new carpet down there, moved the furniture
0 A:  Seem like they --
0 B:  No, they usually don't.
1 A:  They think, you know,  
1 Copper while we're gone.
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  I said, you don't buy mother dogs, you buy little puppies [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  And, uh, in fact, I think that there's some areas of, of Dallas and
0 the open classroom concept.  Uh, where, uh, all, uh, all the students at a
0 I'm not so sure about because of, uh, his attention span.  I think he's a
0 A:  Oh.  
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh, what do you see as problems?  
0 B:  Uh, and I wondered, uh, what the real overall effect on education is of
1 B:  -- and, uh, she will be attending I think Skyline Arts Magnet, uh, or arts
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  And because of where we live, uh, the teams that my son has been on has,
0 grades in one building.
0 B:  Yeah.  Are you native to this area?  
0 much, uh, humidity or, or, uh, rainy time when it's past June.
0 A:  -- and it didn't rain, I moved here like in late August and it didn't rain
0 A:  That's right, that's right.  
0 B:  You know, and here it was like, pretty much you could schedule some
1 A:  You probably know where that is because I know where Pontiac is, so, uh,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  So, 
0 there but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those
0 B:  That's enough to, uh, do some boating -- 
0 A:  Which is, well, I think it's, I think it's toward Ann Arbor, so it's
0 name --
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
0 A:  It was nice.  I always tell people [laughter] that in the winter we use, we
1 A:  Oh.  
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be-, couple days before
1 B:  And I remember getting up and somebody telling me, hey, better wait to go
1 laughing, going yeah, right, that's a good practical joke, ha ha.
0 A:  No, that's not fun either, so, uh, I, I just as soon have all the slushy
1 snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets so,
1 A:  [Laughter] And if it's cold, we say, okay, out you go.  
0 B:  [Laughter] [noise].
0 little bit.  I mean, sometimes the ice is pretty bad, but if you get on the,
0 A:  The Bears, yeah --
0 A:  -- right.  Chica-, Chi-, 
0 A:  Right.  
0 A:  Uh-huh {very faint}.
0 B:  Yeah, Jimmy.  
0 A:  What about his players, uh, and their reactions to him and his, uh, kind of
0 B:  Well, I guess you mean by that that he sort of brings a more of a college
1 A:  Jimmy's going to leave the offense to the offensive coach?  
1 B:  Well, that's the theory [laughter].
1 B:  Well, I don't know whether anybody can for a whole,  
1 been, you know, back since the glory days or before the glory days.
0 thought maybe a, a high school would have played on.
0 coach, you know, uh, stood up in there, in there and,
0 A:  Yeah, I, I, I find myself, uh, when I go to the football games of, uh, of,
1 uh, missing a play by talking to somebody in the group,
0 A:  And then, course, uh, you can see it on the, on the playback out there.
0 still operating out of, uh, the Cotton Bowl --
0 B:  Course,  
0 I think that, uh, they will be a, a drawing card and perhaps they can, uh,
0 ones that shouldn't have gone, but, in his type offense he was looking for
1 B:  Oh, ever-, wherever those little suckers are.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- we travel down the, you know where the channel is down the middle of the
0 A:  Oh. 
1 A:  So you like to go for striper then.  
1 B:  Yeah, of course, I, you know, I won't throw anything back [laughter].
1 B:  And, uh,  
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Oh, wow.  
1 B:  -- because it's sort of dangerous, but, I love it.  I love it. 
0 then we started, uh, either taking our own canoes or renting them --
0 graduated from college and was in the Army and he had a two week period he, he
0 B:  Oh, my goodness.  
1 A:  -- and so I went with him in the middle of May.  And much to our surprise,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 guess I've done.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  When I take the kids out, like I say, we, in fact Memorial Day
0 we got everybody's tents up and camp made and all that and said come on, let's
1 B:  [Lipsmack]  So, it's getting a little difficult to do that but, 
0 B:  And so, you know, that gets a little sore.  
0 B:  -- and they have more fun with that.  
1 what's so funny.
1 B:  And when we're out chasing the big stripers, we use those perch for bait
1 B:  -- but, uh, I can't put the tent up and all that kind of stuff quite yet.
0 A:  I haven't really done any of that.  Uh, and oddly enough, uh, Jackie's
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Oh, my.  
1 A:  Oh, dear.  
1 B:  My youngest is two and he wants to do it all, so [laughter]. 
0 B:  Oh, no, I, I just go out to as many games as I can get to.  
0 A:  Well, they look for their security and their, uh, self-esteem, uh, outside
0 kids that are, are, uh, on drugs or party a lot on weekends and things like
0 A:  They're the, but they are the first ones that will come up and say, you
0 traumatic, especially if they've lived for any length of time --
0 B:  Did you work in the school or in the administrative end of it? 
0 elementary school for three years.
0 B:  Right.  
1 my student, my child does something that you feel deserves licks or some other
0 B:  Right.  
0 women that are working two jobs just to keep a roof over the kids' head and
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  What a hoot.  
1 B:  -- I don't care what you serve.
0 and, uh, melt the cheese over the chips and, uh, put some green pepper or I
0 A:  Yeah,  
1 B:  That's a good idea.  
1 B:  I'm a, I'm a lover of paper plates in the summer time --
0 B:  -- and disposable plastic forks, throw them away for an easy cleanup --
1 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh,
1 A:  -- yeah, that's me too.  
1 B:  Well, my life is kind of casual so, my dinner parties would be also.
0 A:  You know what I was planning on doing, I didn't know if it was needed, but
1 B:  If I have a Mexican dinner at any time, I'll do, 
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 on the column --
1 would go out completely, which is even worse than them just not getting bright
0 discover that that apparently is not the problem, it's not in the switch,
0 diagram that I did have of the car --
0 to try to return that as well.
0 A:  Well, I had one person that I used for years and years on this car, because
0 I've owned this car since it was new, and, uh, but it's over like in the Brook
1 cars, he has narrowed it down to where he only works on, uh, German cars and
0 take it in and check that part out.  I've not had to exchange any other parts
0 A:  while it was in the shop I ended up finding the receipt that I thought
0 pick it up.  But, uh, that's really my only experience in the past year where
0 just wrench control away from you.
0 driving along, uh, decelerating, like coming to a stop sign, but not yet
1 B:  -- and the engine would just quit.  
0 out, and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing, so they
1 B:  [Noise] {paper shuffling}.
0 A:  Do they?  #Uh-huh.#
0 B:  Is, is that the same way as with the aluminum cans [noise] where you go and
1 they,
1 B:  Um.
1 hooked on recycling.
0 has cut down a lot in what we throw out.
1 B:  And I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it. 
0 B:  It's too heavy.
1 A:  #Yeah.#
1 hooked on plastics and paper [laughter] before you know it.
0 B:  [Lipsmack].
0 B:  [Noise] Yeah.
0 A:  You know, (( )), um, I read a book one time or a m-, a magazine article
0 B:  Really.
0 get it started.
1 But, um, they'll do the aluminum cans too but we don't give them those
1 A:  Right. #Right.#
0 B:  So we don't have the newspapers but the, the plastic and the glass [child].
1 B:  You know, because you're just used to throwing things.
1 B:  Uh!
0 A:  -- yeah.  Oh, that's a lot of fun.
0 B:  his parents do too.  And they put her in a home last year.
0 which is kind of frightening when she's in the car.
0 A:  My husband's family are reaching that point but it's, it's so difficult.
1 A:  #That your taste# buds goes back to the sweet taste.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  And the portions, people don't want to try to figure out little bitty
0 B:  #Which# I understand is a really good, you know, way to handle that so
0 B:  No, I don't think there was.  Um, I know a little bit more from a, a
1 room or two separate rooms that share uh, a, uh, bathroom.  All of them all
0 B:  -- #and, and# eat some good meals.  I know when my friend's mother-in-law
1 A:  #Not as independence.#
1 B:  -- #there's nobody there.  Don't you want to be# close to me? [Laughter].
0 to just stay in --
1 we'll find out about it in a casual conversation.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  #Well, when she got home, who took# care of her?
1 B:  Um, most of my hobbies include t-, three little girls.
1 A:  Oh [laughter].
0 trying to get some things in the house organized for that --
0 B:  -- so, uh, I haven't had a lot of time for it, for a little while but, um,
0 B:  -- #I,#
1 #later on.#  
1 B:  #Yeah.  Something# to cover them and keep them warm #[laughter].#
0 B:  [Children].
0 B:  [Noise].
1 A:  some.  And, I have twelve year old daughter that's far surpassed any
0 A:  -- just by ear, I #don't# --
0 time as well.
0 B:  You're more interes-, interested in the instruments then in voice?
0 B:  The T I thing.
0 I think and --
1 B:  -- and, uh, had just a little piano, a little violin [children].  I even
1 B:  -- and they, uh, th-, --
0 A:  Uh.
0 B:  #Probably not [laughter].#
0 B:  Yeah, c-,
0 B:  [Noise].
0 young Americans should spend a year or two,
1 A:  -- and it would certainly help the country, too, uh.
0 B:  you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for
0 A:  But, I, I think that's a small, uh, number #could,#
0 A:  -- it could be out of the area.
1 A:  Oh.
0 B:  You know, as far as doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits
0 Um, if we've lost some of that and it, it seems in the last decade or two, um,
1 A:  -- is helping others {pause} [noise].
0 make a vast difference --
0 A:  Well, I enjoyed talking with you.
0 B:  #And I cannot imagine# being able to do much of anything when they don't
0 A:  [Breathing].
0 B:  So, uh, 
0 the public schools, my, my first im-, impulse was {pause} it isn't really
1 what's wrong with the public, public schools.  It's what's wrong with families
1 B:  That's right.
0 B:  #For example# that child that was shot.
0 A:  #Right.#
0 B:  -- with you, I think that's the main problem.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security.
0 B:  So they started, uh, dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with
1 B:  If they have a rapport with their counselor.  Now if they don't, 
0 people --
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 anyway, one of the key things was that that we believed that the public
0 everybody.  
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
1 A:  -- it's something like that, it's worded.  And, uh, [lipsmack] I don't
0 B:  #Well you know if# we can keep them in school.
1 B:  #It's scary to me.#
0 A:  #And# I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 that they can take French and #music and art and# --
1 A:  #Yeah.#
0 A:  #Well that's the only way they're.#  Yeah, well, that's the only way
1 of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like
1 B:  Culture shock. #It's just,#
1 times but I know so many people that are never able to find that and I'd
0 A:  elderly lady who was putting a, a daughter through nursing school --
0 A:  -- #just purely on# baby-sitting money.  
0 A:  -- #because# both our parents are dead.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 my kids were born, with being able to take off full-time longer --
1 A:  And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals.  I've, of
0 B:  #Well# and I would think, you know, since big business is supposedly why
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  #Right.#
0 A:  -- Employee Assistance #Programs that# --
1 B:  Right.
0 mother does that too, #full-time.#
0 A:  #Well in Plano# though the problem is, you find, and this is what I found
0 B:  #Too transit. Uh-huh.#
0 B:  [Throat_clearing].
0 A:  But we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones.
0 with them. 
0 because they were supposed to be blackberries.  But, uh, we go out, it, it's
1 like them but I need to get out and, and, um, [lipsmack] do that.  Now as far as
1 beautiful lawns and we have this God awful ugly #thing.  And# --
0 A:  #Crappy# [laughter] #I know, we have that too.#
0 A:  The, the other problem that we have, well it's funny because the one, the
1 two bushes on the ends of the house that I think are ugly, they lived
1 B:  I know.
0 in the summer time but it, it's killing everything underneath --
0 A:  Yeah.
0 wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- then maybe we could plant some either flowers,
1 A:  #You know,# maybe just halfway up the window or something like that.  So
1 people can't see and hear too much [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  But, I like to look at the flowers.  They're pretty.
1 B:  I do too, that's why I look at my neighbors yard [laughter].
0 A:  But it's funny because, uh, you try so hard I think sometimes to, to,
0 just a few [lipsmack] months it would all be back and [sigh],
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Whether he likes it or not.
1 A:  #Yeah.#
1 B:  -- #if he'd# just go out there and do it [laughter].
0 A:  How big is a dwarf hamster?
1 A:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  #They're# real tiny.  They're cute.  They really are cute [laughter].
1 A:  My goodness.  Where did you get those?
1 they're both males and they're in two separate cages #so# --
1 A:  #Okay.#  [Laughter].
1 A:  I was going to say #that's,#
1 B:  #We# don't want to go into the dwarf hamster business #[laughter].#
0 B:  [Noise] {sounds like speaker is slicing cutting something on a cutting
0 A:  They're small.
0 B:  #Oh, no# kidding?  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  But we had these two, that, they we knew someone that, uh, uh, you know,
0 wanted to get rid of these kittens and, uh, [sigh] so we gave it a try.  And,
0 litter box and that's the end of that.
0 B:  #Yeah.#
1 A:  Brothers and sisters.  And we had them declawed and we had them neutered
1 A:  Yeah, that was, that was pretty sad because, uh, it took a lot of lobbying
0 course through, uh, T I S C, you know, how they have --
0 A:  Right.
0 who was teaching the course said, sometimes when you have children on this
1 brings the family together.  And we looked at each other and laughed and said
0 gentle and, and [lipsmack] whatnot, so, my husband thought well, for Christmas
0 A:  I'll bet.  
0 B:  a nice dog.
0 A:  #Yeah {very faintly}.#
1 with it.  We have had him now for three years and just love him to death
1 B:  real lousy, uh, watchdog, though, because he, he just loves everybody and

0 A:  Oh.
0 night we had them, somebody knocked over the cage and we thought,

1 B:  the kids, you know.  We said, you know, with the cat in the house, you
1 know, these may [laughter] not last --
1 B:  Sometimes, 
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  I'm kind of that way, too.  When I have, I, I enjoy cooking when I have

1 boys, #too.  So,#  
0 B:  -- what they want to have.
1 B:  [Breathing].
1 B:  -- he already does that [noise].
1 #teenage years# --
1 B:  And he marinates it in his special #stuff# --
0 it, really, to, uh, to suit him.  I didn't grow up eating that much seafood
0 that you serve over rice.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  I don't see how you eat that, #but#
0 B:  Oh.
1 B:  #So it,#
0 A:  -- they eat a pizza or [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.  My husband makes those.

0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 don't, I'm not real good about measuring --
0 B:  -- and, and rice and cream of chicken soup --
0 B:  So,
0 B:  #Yeah, it gives it a, an extra# --
1 A:  You know and now it's, it's, it's okay and you can even, I used to just

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- you know, stuff like that.  And, and drink wise they have Kool-Aid,

0 things that are happening socially in the world around them and in, in, t-,
0 a big effect on the social changes.  Because of the way children are being
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 they might be saving money, I mean even if they had to pay more now, I mean in

0 those cats.  
1 and she said no more.  You know, I just, I can't go through that again and it
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  you know, she says it just makes a world of difference to #come# --
1 camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of
0 A:  So they always just kind of showed up #and# --
0 B:  Yeah, it was --
0 it hard because he was the one who that had left the gate open.  So he --
1 B:  That's just it and right now [breathing] I do well just to take care of my
0 B:  You know without taking care of an animal too.
1 A:  Where'd you all go?
1 B:  We can't talk about that can we?  [laughter]  We went to #Gulf# --

0 @B:  Uh-huh.
0 and, and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal, and sometimes it's, I enjoy
1 A:  Well, a variety.  I, I like to go sometimes without them and,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  sometimes I, sometimes it's okay to take them along. So [laughter],
1 even say, oh, please don't sit us next to a table with other children, 
1 like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 different kinds of food.  So, when we go out, I'm always looking for something
1 standard tacos, enchiladas, tamales and -- 
1 B:  Ethiopian, we've had Ethiopian.  And, uh, not in Plano of #course
1 [laughter].# 
1 B:  But, we really, we really do enjoy going out and uh, and, um, I'm pretty
1 adventurous in cooking, too, which also occasionally [laughter] backfires.
0 I don't know.  You know what, we read, we read the, uh, D MAGAZINE --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Friday paper and sometimes the, the OBSERVER.  Which my husband usually
0 A:  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  We, I guess we, we use the coupons, too.  That's true.
1 B:  So, yeah that, that is really one of our, it's almost a hobby with us.
1 A:  Well I think that it's just, that's ex-, [laughter],  
0 B:  Yes.
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 I always, uh, a waitress or waiter that waits the table, [throat_clearing] it's

0 B:  more of a deterrent, if they had more severe punishments it might be, but
1 A:  Yeah.  Seems like if they had imme-, more immediate, uh, consequences to
1 B:  I think it would concern me even more if I had children, which I don't,

1 the cars because when we, s-, uh, switched to the unleaded gas and, and had
0 lot of people are really afraid of nuclear.  Uh, I'm not afraid of nuclear,
0 afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become, uh, bomb
0 reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground.  As far as I'm concerned,
1 course, would be solar or, uh, [static] fusion, or something clean
0 A:  Yeah.  I, I get that sometimes, um, my line gets some static.  I don't
0 enough I thought our part of the country was ideal.
1 B:  I can't hear you at all for all #this static.#
0 A:  we have a tremendous amount of, um, sunny days.
0 A:  #Well I,#

1 A:  Uh, I hope so [laughter].
1 B:  I do to. [laughter] I like to be optimistic, I don't like to be pessimistic

0 A:  Well, I know, and, a-, you know, and make it available to people th-, that
1 B:  Of course.
0 A:  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, you'd want, you'd want everything available and then
0 A:  -- that would be a terrible thing.  But, #uh# --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  I mean it's such a awful thing to suffer through.
0 @A:  [Static] Well, it's, I am pretty much against it [breathing] [laughter].
1 B:  Oh, I'm pretty much for it.  
1 A:  Oh, good #[laughter] we can have a debate.#
0 really,
1 B:  Right.
0 A:  How about you?  
0 A:  Right.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- but I just, am scared of capital [laughter] --
0 B:  Right.

0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 and everything else, uh,
1 him to, you know, #be executed.#
1 B:  Yeah.  Because, I mean, that's just awful.  
0 B:  #Really.#

0 don't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee, you know.  For instance, I mean,
1 uh, my wife and I are both participating in this survey and she picked up the

1 it's for you.
0 think that in, in terms of like this, I'd, I think that it, it might not be
0 A:  Well, maybe if they could, uh, if they had more money or more, more
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And I don't see that.  To me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument
1 B:  they have the right to know if you're using a, a dangerous substance
0 A:  -- there definitely needs to be some control to it.  I guess it is
0 B:  [/Barking] Yes.  No, I, I, I agree that, you know, you, there needs to be
0 A:  #I mean,# those things do happen.
1 B:  -- I, I agree with you.  If, if, if you feel it's an invasion of privacy,
0 things are all affected.  If not immediately, it certainly does eventually.

1 A:  -- #people's lives [static].#
1 gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that, that, uh, an invasion

0 B:  We're probably about two, two and a half hours south of him.
1 B:  Oh my!
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#   We, we need rain real bad up here.
0 B:  Yeah {very faintly}.  It's been about three weeks since we've had any.
0 B:  Um.

0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
1 A:  #Uh-huh.#
1 A:  Um.  Uh-huh, #uh-huh.#
0 B:  Yeah, I thought that was kind of interesting #too.#
0 A:  -- #too, uh [static].#
1 A:  No, no.  I'm sure it would have to affect you the same way.  I, I can't
0 B:  [Noise] #Right.#
1 A:  The same way [static] our people have to go by their laws when they're

0 hard to get the doctor to refer you to a specialist because they're told --
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  That's right.  And, uh, I mean [noise], you know, that could potentially

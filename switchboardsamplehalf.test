0 women.  And now it's practically all women. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  Yeah,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Our favorite one in Fort Worth [noise]  is [bird_squawk]  downtown Fort
0 B:  And ...
0 A:  Well, of course, you know, you've got, uh, you got a whole different set of
0 B:  # or # whatever but,
1 B:  and they're astounded at the hours that I work.

0 B:  Oh, ((really)).
0 A:  -- and I'm a U T freak, too. 
0 role in business and I see, uh, women's roles expanding in the political area,
0 A:  # that # we haven't seen for a while [laughter].  So that, that's kind of,

1 release, right there. 
0 B:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
1 A:  Well of course.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 community, well like in high school they should teach politics or the
0 B:  # Wasn't it # the day after Reagan was elected that they were brought home.
1 about the same [laughter],
1 sale [laughter]. 
1 A:  Did I interrupt your reading schedule? [laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 will play over and over [laughter], 
0 B:  and you just tune it out because it's the same thing but,
0 A:  -- lower the standards a little bit, and that way more people qualify and,
0 A:  You know Cancun is just really overbuilt. 
0 B:  Germany.  
0 A:  Oh it was awful, it was absolutely hideous and, and we had a dinner party
1 athlete,
0 A:  Then, again just picking a school, Texas is --
0 B:  Okay.
1 the, on the subject, [laughter] so if you want me to stay on it I'll try.
1 B:  Well, I cannot stand Dan Rather.

1 B:  Yeah.  You know it's, uh, about fifteen minutes until noon here, and we're,
1 to have Italian sausage and French fries [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yep.

0 B:  #And I guess,# I always thought if it was, threatening my personal safety
0 B:  I know that there are many countries that, uh, are very successful with the
0 other, but, uh, to me their not that big enough for a pool, but, you know,
1 rain, I, I swear they close everything down.  I just laugh.
0 B:  -- and about, uh, eight, nine, about nine years ago, I guess, we put a

1 here, but, but she didn't put a fly in them [laughter].
0 A:  they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 this before.  They, um, asked us for again an astounding amount of information
1 and it has not,
0 B:  and I think that is why. 
0 B:  without being charged any interest.   
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  -- very often.  
0 have a little more time, uh, I might take up, there is, I would love to

0 A:  Uh, no.  It is, it is, it is like a country, country home.
0 B:  Yeah.  It --  
0 A:  -- voters  --

0 B:  They're abandoned by their families, yeah.
0 A:  Clint Eastwood.
0 with arms and feet and little eyes, and his parents are there.  They have it
0 would say, maybe, you know, a day or two a week to get out to go do something
1 A:  So I am just sort of seeing what all the hassles are, you know of,
0 B:  Enjoyed talking to you.   
1 A:  There are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or even an hour off
0 north Tex-, north Dallas which is like a suburb, near a suburb called Plano.
0 sure knew as heck when I was growing up that, uh, my parents were [laughter]
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 and hours --
0 with my hose, and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and
0 B:  if I didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty-five bucks, and I
1 A:  I was past that point --
0 B:  -- if it'll stick with her.  She's still young, in elementary school.  So.
0 ended up killing the rabbit in the end, [laughter] uh, but then of course, the
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  It's like, it has a hundred and fifty-three thousand.
0 A:  Oh, yeah --
0 A:  Uh, although we, in New York we had to pay a state and a city, uh, tax.

1 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  what i-, and I felt like way out of shape.  
1 B:  Yeah [laughter]. 
0 A:  # Gosh.  #

0 going to get a lot more done more quickly than they, then they really did.
1 know.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities,

1 B:  [Laughter]  Oh.
1 A:  So I think the cockroach will evolve, uh, sa-, safely [laughter].
0 B:  It's,
0 A:  I think, I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government
1 A:  but golly, I had to quit my job and stay home [laughter].
0 B:  -- that was out, and I think it was a, it was an adult book. 
0 A:  -- and I went to my mother's, I read a book that I have, should have read
0 I,

1 wimpy that you can understand why men get frustrated with them,
0 A:  -- that's a good thing.  
0 A:  It's, I guess, pretty, pretty healthy, but I don't have a regular plan,

0 any sense of, of the value of, and worth, so that they have real problems when
0 B:  Not in this country.  
0 maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some

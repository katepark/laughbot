0 looking for a school for him but, uh, like a preschool or something that where
0 but that there's, it carried over,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Well, okay, see, we're getting back to last year.  That's probably the last

0 A:  And then, the little one that, or the last one, I guess I should say, uh,
0 B:  -- that's just [throat_clearing],
0 A:  Yeah.  I think that's more important probably than even the career
0 A:  Oh, how interesting.

0 A:  Well, what they told me at --
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Oh, I can believe it. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.

0 and, and, uh, I know in our office, um, our secretary gives everyone, uh, all
0 A:  You can only wear, and supposedly, we don't have an opportunity, my
0 do something the first time, that's not real bad, you know,
1 A:  No, apparently not, because look how many years they've been doing that and
0 A:  I, you know, I guess, you-, your, like the earthquake was in San Francisco?
0 B:  We can replant three times a year and get stuff.
0 B:  People that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation, you
1 B:  Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and
0 they can go and say, you get this much credit line.  You know.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  My, uh, daughter has owned two different ones, and, uh, you know,

0 B:  Well, well you'd think so but, uh, 
0 B:  Yeah, they have to import a lot of their, um, cereals, and things, and I
0 A:  Yeah, instead of something greasy or,
0 of blood and guts, isn't it.  I don't particularly care for that sort of
1 into cans [laughter] at this point rather than the liter bottles
1 A:  -- and that's nice and everything, but, you know, it's funny, I can't
1 good-bye [laughter]. 
1 A:   Especially that one waterfall scene [laughter].  
1 each other, so that,
0 A:  Great, great.  Yeah.  
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 for a calling card also.  
0 A:   It, well, and that's probably, we do like the night life, to
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
1 A:   Maybe.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  [Laughter] And then some.

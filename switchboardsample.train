0 B:  Hi.
0 A:  Um, yeah, I would like to talk about how you dress for work, and, and, um,
0 what do you normally, what type of outfit do you normally have to wear?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And in the summer, just dresses.  We can't even, well, we're not even
0 really supposed to wear jeans very often, so,
0 B:  It really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is
0 kind of, you know, always the same temperature.
0 where you work?  Do they ask,
0 B:  Not formally, 
0 A:  Right.
0 nice.  A lot of times we have to go over to, uh, like Jerry Junkins' office
0 and Bill Ellsworth's office to deliver stuff,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  and we prepare a lot of foils for Marvin, and Bill, so we have to dress a
0 little bit nice. We're not,
0 A:  Right, right.  And does it, does it change?  I guess, um, you can, can you
0 judge like, uh, depending on what you think you'll be doing that day?
0 vacation or something, we can dress a little more casual,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  or, ice storms, of course, you know, we all came in in our tennis shoes
1 A:  Yes [laughter].
0 A:  that's right.  #And it,#
0 B:  #unless# it's an ex-, you know, an unusual day,
0 engineering, and,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and it was, it was a casual office, there was no formal dress code, but,
0 um, uh, usually engineers are expected to, to dress, you know, a little more
0 professionally, it,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  just in case things would come up during the day, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and would want to
0 see you,
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  uh, other times it could be very casual.  If you knew you would be at a
0 desk all day and nobody could see you,
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  What area do you work in?
0 A:  Uh, well, I was, I was in a, uh, private consulting firm, 
1 A:  and, uh, anyway, um, right now I-, I'm not, I'm not there but [laughter],
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 changes with the,
0 B:  it, with the,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  wear light clothing I guess, if it's hot out, but, um,
0 B:  But then usually in the summer, it's cold in the offices because the air
0 A:  that's --
0 B:  is doing it's job so well.
0 A:  -- that's true, and, and I think also that, um, the women actually have a,
0 c-, you have a little bit more variety, m-, maybe lighter cotton clothing in
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  and woolens in the winter, where as the, the men often,
0 B:  It,
0 A:  have to wear shirt and tie [laughter] no matter,
0 A:  Right, right. #What time of, what time of the year.#
0 B:  Uh, they can't have a rayon suit.
0 A:  do they, were, were there, um, are you allowed to, um, be casual, like if
0 it was summer, were, were you allowed to wear sandals, and those, tha-, not
0 real,
0 B:  Not really, I think, I mean it's kind of unwritten, but I think we're
0 supposed to wear hose and, and shoes,
0 A:  Right.
0 m-, actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else.
0 A:  Oh, I see, uh-huh.
0 B:  But, I'm not in that professional of a position, so,
0 A:  Okay, and, and --
0 B:  I don't, I'm not expected to do that.
0 A:  -- and also, like the, um, also the, the, all the supporting kind of stuff,
0 secretaries, and clerks and things, are they also,
0 A:  they have same, similar?
0 B:  Yes, pretty much,
0 A:  Yeah, ours were, ours were different.  I guess it seemed like th-, they
0 were much, there was much more casual dress, although I don't think everybody
0 looked at that, you know as a good thing.
0 B:  Yeah, but there's really no written rule, 
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  I guess they couldn't write that down, that might be discrimination, or
0 something, I don't know [laughter].
0 A:  That's, [laughter] that's right.
0 B:  I mean, I've never been told what to wear or what not to wear.  It's just,
0 you know, judging from what everyone else wears,
0 B:  you know, what I feel a, comfortable in.  
0 A:  That's right.
0 B:  You don't want to stand out too much.
0 A:  Yeah, that's true.  And, um, um.  ((Well, let's see)),
0 B:  Well, that pretty much covers the topic [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah. [laughter] I don't know what el-, what more we could say about that,
0 that,
0 B:  Well, thanks for calling me.
0 B:  Yep.
0 B:  #That's all.  Good-bye.#  
0 A:  Nice talking to you.  Bye-bye.
0 B:  Well, of course, it's, you know, it's one of the last few things in the
0 world you'd ever want to do, you know.  Unless it's just, you know, really,
0 you know, and, uh, for their, uh, you know, for their own good.
0 A:  Yes.  Yeah.
0 B:  I'd be very very careful and, uh, you know, checking them out.  Uh, our,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- uh, eight months ago I guess.  And, uh, we were, I was fortunate in that
0 A:  Yeah.
0 that we had to do it.  But there's, well, I had an occasion for my
0 mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be, you know, could not take care of
0 herself anymore, was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really
0 not a very good experience.  Uh, it had to be done in a hurry.  I mean, we
0 didn't have, you know, like six months to check all of these places out.  And
0 it was really not, not very good, uh, deal.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  nursing home that we finally had.  Fortunately, she only had to stay
0 [noise] {faint in background} a few weeks and she was able to, to return to
0 her apartment again.  But it's really a big, uh, big, uh,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B: decision as to, you know, when to do it.  You know, is there something
0 else we could have done, you know, in checking out all the places that, uh,
0 B:  especially, you know, smaller areas,  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  smaller towns.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Probably the hardest thing in, in my family, uh, my
0 grandmother, she had to be put in a nursing home and, um, she had used the
0 walker for, for quite some time, probably about six to nine months.  And, um,
0 she had a fall and, uh, finally, uh, she had Parkinson's disease,
0 A:  Then she lived in an apartment and, uh, that was even harder --
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- actually.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Because it was, you know, it was just a change of, change of location and
0 it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling.
0 B:  Yes.  
0 A:  I mean, she tr-, she had, she had children all across the United States --
0 B:  Uh-huh  
0 children.
0 B:  Right.  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  And, um, that was pretty heart-rending for her.   
0 B:  I can imagine.  
0 A:  I think when she finally came to the realization that, you know, no, I
0 cannot, I cannot take care of myself.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  That's tough.  That's tough.  
0 A:  Yeah.  I mean, for somebody who is, you know, for most of their life has,
0 has, uh, not just merely had a farm but had ten children --
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- had a farm, ran everything because her husband was away in the coal
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  And, you know, facing that situation, it's, it's quite a dilemma.
0 B:  Yes.  
0 A:  I think,
0 B:  my mother, excuse me.  Go ahead.  
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, my, uh, my, uh, probably one of the biggest decisions I think
0 that decision --
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- than just delegate it.  I think that they, they had a great deal of, um,
0 all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference.
0 B:  That's great.  
0 A:  And, I mean, it was just, it was probably one of the most strengthening
0 B:  That's right.  
0 A:  And, and just the children were involved in the decision, because it
0 involved just them.
0 B:  Right.  Yeah.  
0 A:  And, you know, making that decision and then finding a place and everybody
0 had duties --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 whether it was actually taking part in a lot,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  of the decision making, you know, 
0 B:  Yep.  
0 A:  like finding a proper nursing home.  
0 B:  You were very, 
0 A:  And they,
0 B:  fortunate.  
0 A:  I know.  They, and, well, they had, well, they had, they had seen it
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  So, so, I mean, it, I mean, I, I, I, I har-, I, I truly wish that if
0 something like that were to happen that my children would do something like,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  that for me. 
0 like that seem to fall to, you know, maybe one child in the whole family, you
0 know.
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we, we,
0 B:  And, uh, it's usually not a very smooth,  
0 B:  smooth thing.  We were, I was lucky too that I only have one brother.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  And, uh, fortunately, we agreed, you know, on exactly, you know, what we
0 thought should be done.  My mother also was very very independent.  She had
0 her own, still had her own little house and still driving her own car,
0 B:  at age eighty-three.  We were lucky in, that in one respect in that after
0 she had her stroke she wasn't really, you know, really much aware of what was
0 going on.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  That nursing home life would not have been, you know, anything of her
0 choosing, of course, she would, she would not have been happy there at all.
0 A:  Um. 
0 B:  But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us.
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, with my, with my grandmother I think it was, it was
0 such that, uh, that she did not have the problem with, she was very well aware
0 and her daughter came and visited her --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- at least her daughter, 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  came and visited her and also her several grandchildren, 
0 A:  came and visited her every day. 
0 A:  And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest,
0 [lipsmack] um, I, I, I think it would be, it was more of a relief --
0 B:  Sure. 
0 with, with Alzheimer's.
0 A:  or something like, 
0 A:  that which is, which is far more devastating. 
0 B:  Yes.  Absolutely. 
0 A:  And, um, I, I, I think that what one thing that they were concerned
0 probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily, you know, like the quantity of
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- but the quality of,
0 B:  Yes. 
0 A:  care.  That the people that worked there -- 
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  -- were very --  
0 A:  -- were very interested that, to make it as close a home environment,
0 A:  as possible. 
0 B:  Yes.  It would, 
0 A:  I think, I think, I think, you know for myself I, I see that as probably
0 the, the, what everything would hinge upon.
0 B:  Oh,  
0 A:  Is it, how close is it to a home environment. 
0 B:  Yes.  That's right. 
0 B:  I think that great strides are being made nowadays in, in caring for the
0 elderly, you know, in several, in a,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah.  You know it's, it's interesting that, that a lot, the population of
0 the United States is changing because, you know, uh, now that so many more
0 minorities, where they have had extended families for such a long time.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Um, matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families.
0 B:  Uh-huh, 
0 A:  It wasn't,
0 B:  true. 
0 A:  But, I guess as we become more industrialized and more, you know, less in a
0 B:  Yes, um. 
0 A:  -- we, we don't, we, we, we choose not to deal with the, 
0 A:  extended family -- 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  -- because we feel it's kind of cumbersome, 
0 B:  That's right.
0 A:  when in reality it makes things much much easier. 
0 B:  Sure.  Absolutely.  And, 
0 B:  people, things are scattered so much nowadays. 
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I, I think that perhaps, perhaps the extended family, you
0 know, that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care.
0 B:  Yes.  
0 A:  You know I mean, of course there, there comes other issues, you know,
0 whether or not any of the grandparents [laughter] whether ((we feel like)) are
1 children.
0 B:  [Laughter] Yes, 
0 A:  But,  
0 A:  I mean they raised us after all. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make
0 them a good child carer.
0 A:  Yeah.  But, uh, I, I, I think that, you know, we always, uh, I mean, I've,
0 I've had a lot of good experiences with, uh, with many many people especially
0 where they've had, uh, extended family.  And I, and I, I kind of see that,
0 environment and --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  -- and get down to the values of, you know, I mean, uh, it's, money seems
0 to be too big of an issue.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.   
0 A:  With,    
0 B:  sure. 
0 A:  with, with, 
0 B:  realistically it is. 
0 A:  with what's going on today and I, I think, I think that we may not, that
0 may be, you know, perhaps if we put money on the back burner --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  That would, 
0 A:  I mean, 
0 B:  certainly help. 
0 A:  I mean we may not, we may not have as high a standard of living --
0 B:  Right.  That's just a matter of defining priorities, I guess --
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
0 B:  -- or some priorities anyway. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  I think your right. 
0 @@A:  Okay.  Well, I guess that was it [laughter]. 
0 B:  Okay.  It was good talking to you. 
0 A:  Okay. 
0 B:  Take care. 
0 A:  Hey. 
0 pollution, as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the
0 atmosphere around us.
0 @B:  Right.
0 lines?
0 B:  Me, I'm in the legal department and, um, we do have, uh, a group of
0 attorneys who handle our environmental issues.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And I don't know too much about the air pollution thing.  I do know for
0 other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that T I has to dispose
0 of that we normally put in the ground, you know, we're coming up with a, uh, a
0 new solution.  We have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just
0 transport to these places.  But after awhile it always seems that the, um, oh,
0 new idea is to take everything up to Sherman, and we're going have that, you
0 know, incineration place up there and,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  dump everything there.  And supposedly that facility will not generate
0 air pollutants from what I've heard, that everything would be in, in, you
0 know, a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.  And that we
0 won't be polluting the air.  I'm sure we have to have, uh, permits, you know,
0 A:  Yeah.  It's, uh, hav-, uh, uh, well, I work in (( )), I work in
0 environmentals, uh, projects right now.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 project.
0 B, that send out, uh, jurisdictions under which we have to, uh, uh, reply to.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear, so we have our
0 manager of environmental, who assist the T A C B, which is located in Austin,
0 in writing and, hey, look what we've done here at T I.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And, uh, we are presently, uh, in receipt of a site permit, which will
0 allow us to, um, [lipsmack] uh, this is our side a-,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage.  It's in,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  in, in tons per year.  Um, and so, w-, w-, you know, what we do to make
0 scrubber systems, uh, that, uh, scrub out the, N O X and, uh, V O C's and, and
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 emissions.  So if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is
0 zero or twenty or thereabouts.  And so what we go through is, uh, if you see
0 it smoking there's a problem.  And having worked with some of the legal folks
0 very closely, uh, it becomes a real issue, especially, when it's smoking and
0 you have to get it fixed el pronto.
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  As you know, they, they're allowed to come on site, the federaldes, anytime
0 they want, drive through, and see, and inspect.
0 Um,
0 B:  Now is that place built or you're still on the makings of it?
0 Sherman City Council with, um,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And, uh, its real, uh, going real well.  I think it's matter, just a matter
0 of fund,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  funds right now as I understand it.  Uh, but it's, uh, it's something
0 where it won't have any emissions.  You're correct.  It will have something
0 coming out of the stackhouse it was,
0 B:  Right.
0 put safety and environmental on the utmost, foremost, uh, uh, first thing we
0 always look at.  And we probably put more money into the systems and
1 the stuff, everything we do over here.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  and, uh, it's an interesting job.  But um,
0 cites that have gone bad and you have to clean up.  And, you know the law now
0 is the super fund and anybody who's contributed toxic waste, no matter if you
0 were somebody that eventually, you know, uh, damaged the ground or not.  Uh,
0 gotten, uh, gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and, you
0 know, fill in some other area and, um, certainly, it would to have a better
0 solution, like the Sherman facility than, um, just letting it go in the
0 ground.  Because eventually, you know, it, it seems that no matter what they
0 do, if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined,
0 uh, dump area.  It still only in time starts to leak out.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Yeah.  I'm familiar with that one.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  We have, we have stuff that's very interesting, uh, we have hoods, we have
0 have, um, that we sample --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- and it may have over, uh, a certain emission levels, this is on the
0 ((solid side)), and so we take it and, uh, we can't ((deep well)) inject
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- and actually, um, potash, per se, and concrete and then actually put it
0 in the ground.  But not so, not in a hazardous waste location because it's,
0 basically, a concrete slab.
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  It was totally legal.  But the cost of doing this is astronomical,
0 B:  Um,
0 A:  they actually show you what duckwork and things.  And so we were, uh,
0 expenditures because it could get very expensive.  But I think we, uh, you
0 know, we do all kinds of things to make the, the world a better place to live,
0 at how much effort and energy is put into doing that.  I really would.  Um,
0 [lipsmack] I've enjoyed speaking with you,
0 A:  This has been an interesting topic.  Uh, [lipsmack] I was one of the, I was
0 north building [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, you were?
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  So, uh, I hope you like your office.
0 B:  Yes.  Yes.  It's a heck of a lot different.  And we used to be really
0 embarrassed about the gray metal desk.  We were about the only,
0 come and laugh and go, gee, I hadn't seen one of those ten, fifteen years.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Glad to see y'all taken care of.  Well, the, uh, I think what changed
0 everything and, uh, is, uh, y'all were, y'all were the only ones that make any
1 money for TI, here in the last ten years,
0 B:  [Laughter]  We,
0 A:  Ju-,
0 before.
0 A:  Exactly.  And that's, um, when, when you start, when you start paying your
0 way, uh, you know, Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys.
0 B:  Right.  Right.
0 A:  I was just,
0 B:  Not just overhead.  
0 A:  Exactly.  I've enjoyed speaking with you.
0 A:  See you later.  Bye-bye.
0 suppose manufacturing contributes, uh, quite a bit to air pollution.
0 A:  Yeah, I, I, I think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders.  But
0 then there's, like you say, there's industry with all the, uh, sulfur and all
0 B:  Uh, yeah.  You know, I'm wondering, uh, of course, uh, Freon is, uh, is,
0 A:  Uh.  
0 B:  -- our, what you call it layer, there, 
0 A:  Ozone, yeah. 
0 B:  ozone layer. 
0 A:  ozone pollution, yeah. 
0 B:  I wonder when they're going to, what they'll be able to you in pr-, in
0 suitable replacement for Freon and, and you have to have it for refrigeration,
0 so.
0 B:  [Throat_clearing]. 
0 A:  But, on the other hand, you know, I, I've, um, I took a boat cruise one
0 time and it had a refrigerator on board and it was powered by propane.  I-, it
0 was actually powered by a flame.
0 B:  Uh, well, actually, you know, that is the way a refrigerator works.
0 A:  Yeah, uh, it, it, something with heat, I don't understand the mechanics of
0 it, but, uh,
0 B:  Well, basically, what happens is, you have to have some form of heat.
0 B:  Be it electrical, as in your home refrigerator.  Or propane, as the one on
0 the ship that you said --
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  -- uh, you had.  And, uh, somehow, cr-, heat must be created that Freon,
0 oh, I'm not exactly sure what happens, but apparently it expands in the heat.
0 And, in the process of expanding, it goes through cooler coils and whatnot,
0 and it becomes fr-, ice cold.
0 A:  Oh, okay.  So it still had Freon in it. 
0 B:  Oh, yes.  Yes, 
0 A:  Oh, okay.  I well, uh,
0 B:  Freon's, uh, Freon is in a closed circuit. 
0 B:  Uh,  
0 unless the lines are broken.
0 B:  Well, did you ever see what happens when they, uh, replace the, or
0 replenish the Freon in your automobile air conditioner?
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  I mean, there's, uh, a lot of it, 
0 A:  Yeah.  Escape. 
0 B:  is, uh, turned out into the atmosphere. 
0 A:  sure.  Yeah, yeah, I,   
0 B:  And I understand now, uh, I don't know if it's international or just here
0 in Texas, or what, but, uh, service stations are going to require to have a
0 special device to catch this Freon as it is ex-, expelled, the excess Freon.
0 even be able to do it yourself at home.
0 A:  Well, that makes sense.  I, I'm more worried about the ozone than I am
0 that kind of stuff.  Uh, cooperating with the Canadians on the acid rain
0 problem.  But the ozone, I mean, you know, we can't replace that.
0 B:  No, that's true.  
0 A:  We, we can't clean it up. 
0 B:  You know, I can remember as a child,  
0 B:  uh, spending summers at my grandfather's place, and I'd be running around
0 with nothing but a bathing suit, no shoes, socks, shirts, or anything.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh, I mean, from dawn till dusk. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  And I developed a nice tan.  But, uh, my gosh, never had to worry about,
0 uh, skin cancer.
0 B:  Or for that matter, you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably
0 clear and, and get a drink of water without worrying, uh --
0 B:  -- about catching some disease.  
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  When I was a kid I used to do the same thing.
0 It's, uh, I, I don't kn-, I don't know what the rain forests have to do with
0 it, but, you know, they're chopping those down at a tremendous rate every day.
0 scrubbing stuff there, and they're, [laughter] they're taking away the sponge.
0 B:  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  
0 A:  I don't know, this, uh, ozone, 
0 I sent me up on a trip to Wyoming, I think it was.  And I was out in this
0 little town, kind of backwoods town, you know, wh-, where a big night on the
1 town is going down watching the traffic light change.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah. 
0 B:  But, uh, I checked into a motel, and after I signed in and everything, why,
1 the, uh, clerk told me, uh, don't drink the water.  It's contaminated,
0 B:  He said, now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests, but,
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  Well, the next morning I got up and the water had not been delivered yet.
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  You, you probably did less harm than what the water would have done though
0 [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, well, th-, they had this, uh, it's some kind of a bacteria cal-, or
0 carried by animals.
0 B:  And it, they got their water from this, uh, beautiful mountain river.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Well, maybe not quite a river, but a little bigger than a stream.
0 B:  But this, uh, bacteria had, uh, penetrated their entire pipe system, or
0 water system.
0 A:  Gosh.  
0 B:  And they tried flushing it out.  They, they couldn't get rid of it.
0 A:  Gaw.  That's,
0 B:  I've often wondered, now this is years ago, and I've often wondered what
0 they ever did.  Of course, oh, it was a beautiful mountain stream.  Bubbling
0 nicely, you know, the, which, uh, is what purifies the water when,
0 A:  Yeah, right.  The, 
0 B:  it bubbles.  
0 A:  the action over the rocks and all that kind of stuff [throat_clearing].
0 B:  Yes.  And yet even at that it was still contaminated.  
1 taps now because you never know what's going to come out, you know [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Yes. 
0 A:  And I, and I, and I don't really trust these, these government agencies
0 that test this stuff.  I really don't.
0 B:  Well, I'm beginning to wonder, too.  I mean, you, you're always hearing
0 turn around and, my gosh, it's okay to, to doing it this way, but if you turn
0 in there and they supposedly inspect this chicken.  I don't know if you ever
0 saw that SIXTY MINUTES thing where they showed a chicken processing plant.
0 B:  As a matter of fact I did.  
0 A:  Yeah.  I, I haven't touched chicken since.  
0 B:  Neither have I [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, I, I, couldn't, I couldn't bear to think about eating a chicken after
0 A:  Right.  That's about what they say about the, the air pollution in this
0 better.  And then you turn around and you look and places like Los Angeles,
0 it's st-, still so thick you have to cut it with a knife.  I don't know.
0 B:  I've often wondered about, uh, L A.  Now that's suppose to be about the
0 worst c-, c-, c-, {stutters} city in the country, I guess, for,
0 A:  Just about.  Yeah.  
0 that little sticker in the window.  I know Texas does.
0 B:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  And there are about three places in Georgia that does.  And I think
0 more.
0 B:  Well, uh, they used to do it down in Florida.  Now, I lived down there for
0 B:  No, they did away with it, 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  because they found out that, uh, the people that were doing it, it was
0 just a racket to them.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  [inhaling] I think that's the problem with most of it.  The
0 politicians finally did away with it because the people were so mad about
0 having to pay that fee.
0 B:  And for, uh, for nothing.  (( ))  T-, t-, to,  
0 A:  And, yeah.  And, and I mean, all it was was a revenue generator.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  It, it wasn't serving the purpose that it was designed to serve.  I mean,
0 you look at the cars driving down the road, and you look at these things
0 belching huge, blue clouds of oil smoke.  And you tell me that guy passed a
0 pollution test, y-, [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well, now, here's another thing.  Diesels, uh, diesel engines are,
0 A:  [Throat_clearing]. 
0 B:  are the worst.    
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, those are,  
0 B:  And yet, they haven't done a thing to them.  
0 A:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, w-, was back in the, uh, late seventies when
0 Now you look.  Diesel's what?  One forty, one fifty a gallon, while gas is,
0 you know, one oh five.
0 a diesel engine Escort.
0 A:  I never did like diesels anyway.  They, they were too cantankerous.  Cold
0 w-,
0 B:  Well, they, um, I, I had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up
0 on me [/static],
0 A:  Um. 
0 B:  here a few weeks ago.  
0 A:  Yeah.  A friend of mine had a, uh, had a Buick, had, had a diesel in it and
0 he had nothing but trouble with the thing.
0 B:  Is that right?  
0 B:  Well, 
0 A:  time the, the diesel would jell and it wouldn't, I don't know, liquefy
0 right.  And then his injector things got clogged, and, oh, go-,
0 been Buick, I think, because I think it was G M that came out with a dis-, or
0 diesel engine that was converted from a gas engine.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  And, uh, they used the same pistons and, and cylinders and whatnot.  But
0 all they did was change the, uh, uh, the induction ports, and, uh, et cetera,
0 et cetera, whatever needed to be changed over.  And, although they were, it
0 seemed practical at the time, they were nothing but a headache.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  And they did w-, w-, finally did away with them, 
0 A:  That, that may, tha-,
0 B:  and went to a straight diesel.  
0 A:  yeah.  That may have been what he had.  Um, but speaking of cars,
0 [throat_clearing] what more can we do to cars to make them less
0 B:  Well, now, of course in California, they, they have much stricter codes
0 than we have elsewhere.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Now, could be, that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in
0 California.  I don't know what it is, precisely, but, uh, they're doing, they
0 do something a little more stricter than we do.
0 A:  I'm just wondering about the feasibility of the electric cars.  I saw an
0 B:  Um, on occasion. 
0 B:  On occasion.  Um, I do vary.  Um, you know, I wear suits, I wear skirts
0 and sweaters.  On occasion I can wear jeans.  Um, how about you?
0 A:  Well, I, um, run a business out of my home. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  So I tend to get up in the morning, put on,
0 B:  Yes. 
0 A:  sweats, um,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  do whatever I want to do with the kids, then whenever I have a meeting
0 with a client, I'll put a suit on.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Um, you know, there's real no, no real dress code where I work.
0 Um, you see people wearing, you know, all different attire.  I, um, don't like
0 to wear heels, that really tires me out.  I work in a big building.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  So, I predominantly wear flat shoes.  Um, you know, in the winter I wear
0 sweaters, in summer I, you know, I like one piece dresses, short sleeves,
0 things like that.
0 A:  I've recently, um, tried to update my wardrobe, trying to put suits
0 together that I can interchange, the,
0 A:  jackets and the blouses and all that a lot. 
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  That's helped me a lot with having, I can only have a, a limited wardrobe,
0 since I'm only,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  working part-time right now. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Um, but still, it gives it some variety. 
0 A:  Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that.
0 B:  Right, right, accessories, uh-huh. 
0 A:  What about your casual wear?  Do you like to wear jeans most of the time?
0 while saying remainder of statement} sweatpants and things like that,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  also.  
0 A:  It's nice you can wear shorts, especially on a day like today when it's so
0 hot.
0 B:  Yeah, well, they're, um, you know, they're like Ber-, 
0 A:  Dress shorts. 
0 B:  yeah, they're like black corduroy Ber-, Bermuda shorts. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  And sometimes I wear a blazer with them, and I get really a lot of
0 compliments on them.  Um, where I work is predominantly male.
0 B:  So, you know, they, their attire is always the same, you know.  Suits or
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  you know, jeans, whatever.  
0 A:  ((Yeah, but)), 
1 but seems to work for me [breathing] [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter]  ((Yeah, but)).  
0 B:  In fact, I just bought, I, I just got a new outfit as a gift that, um,
0 it's one of those skorts, you know, th-, it's shorts but it looks like a
0 skirt.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  So, I think that'll be good for work, too. 
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  It'll be comfortable. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So,
0 changed quite a bit.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Um, we moved from Colorado where, and I have a closet full of sweaters.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  That,
0 B:  Well, see, I live in Virginia.
0 A:  You live in Virginia, now? 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Oh, that's interesting. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I'm, you know, like right now, today was in about, you

0 A:  This is pretty un-, unseasonal, but, uh, at least, we, you know, it, it, it

1 A:  Okay. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Okay? 
0 A:  It was nice talking to you. 
0 B:  Okay, it was nice talking to you, also. 
0 A:  Bye-bye. 
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  But uh, my family used to have a pop-up trailer.
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  And, we'd go camping to a lot of different places.  We spent two weeks in
0 Bastrop, Texas once.
0 B:  Oh, okay.  I'm not that much familiar with Texas.  We've been, my family
0 has been everywhere, but mostly in Texas on the way to someplace else.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  We've had, oh gosh, we've, I've camped in a, in a, in a back of a van, the
0 we got a pop-up camper, and then we got a trailer, now they've got, now
0 A:  Have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks? 
0 B:  Oh, gosh, yes, uh, oh, Yellowstone about four years ago, four or five years
0 ago, and um, oh, we di-, my family, when I was younger, we went, that was
0 national park.  We had a lot of fun.
0 little bit of el-, electricity, and,
0 B:  Yes.
0 A:  a little bit of running water.
0 B:  Me too [laughter].
0 A:  I'm not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days with
0 nothing.
0 B:  Oh, no.  No! [laughter] I've done it but it's not fun [laughter].  You
0 don't want to do it for like three weeks at a time, that's for sure
0 [laughter].
0 A:  I have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer.
0 They are both geologists and they load up their truck with their tent and they
0 go to New Mexico.  And, they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks
0 B:  Ugh, no.
0 A:  It doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me.  
0 B:  No.
0 A:  My friend said that the last time they went, uh, she just got tired of the
0 tent, and it was cold at night, and,
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  she got tired of eating out of cans, and so, they stayed in a hotel one
1 night,
0 A:  just for fun.
0 B:  Shaking the scorpions out of their shoes [laughter].
0 A:  No kidding, no kidding.  Gosh, this way, the, the bugs, I don't like the
0 bugs.
0 night.
0 A:  Yeah.  The one nice thing I remember about camping with my parents is they
0 had a big hammock.  And, they would always find a couple, a campsite with a
0 couple of good trees that,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  to hang it in between, and I could just lay in the hammock for hours.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, that's nice.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Well like, when fam-, when my family camps, we're, the only time you're at
0 National Parks and stuff [sniffing].  We camped at the, let's see, we camped
0 down at, at Galveston two or three years ago and that, that was, that was fun
0 except that they, uh, were having a lot of problems with dead fish on the
0 shore and they were, and the, and the smell of, that was kind of gross but
0 [laughter],
0 A:  We stayed in Galveston Island State Park once.  But, if, a storm blew in,
0 and it was just horrible, and the sand was blowing up our camp,
0 A:  the little camping area was pretty near the shore,
0 B:  Uh-huh, oh yeah.
0 A:  and there were some pretty big dunes before the, the camping area, and
0 the sand was all blowing up, and you couldn't even go out of the camper, the
0 wind was blowing so hard, because you'd get sand in your eyes.
0 B:  Oh, that's miserable.
0 A:  Yeah, it was pretty bad, pretty bad.
0 B:  Yeah.  I ha-,
0 and things to do in case it rained,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  and my parents always let us take a couple of friends, so we always had a
0 B:  Yeah.  If, if you always, when there's kids you've always got to have other
0 stuff to do cause it's always going to rain sometime [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And, then your par-, par-, they drive the parents nuts [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, well children aren't easily entertained by just enjoying the nature.
0 B:  Oh, I know.  Wish I, I wish I had appreciated it more,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 I've got a child and another one on the way, so I,
0 A:  My fianc3ee and I, one day, would like to own a big motor home.  Mainly
0 because he's a football, he's a college football coach,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and we're going to have to travel a lot,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  and, it would be nice if we had a big old motor home and that way I could
0 B:  Yeah.  and go to wherever the football game is, and have someplace to sleep
0 B:  That's true.
0 A:  and, park it outside of the stadium, and have a good old time.
0 B:  Plus it's nice to have your own stuff there.
0 A:  Um, um.  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.  Plus you get, eating out is, is so expensive.
0 A:  No kidding.  It really is.
0 our family lives in Missouri and, uh, when we take trips home we take our
0 pop-up with us in good weather, and stay overnight at a state park or
0 something, so we don't have to rent a hotel room and,
0 B:  and, that's, that's nice.  You know, paying five or six dollars instead
0 of forty [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.  No kidding.
0 B:  Yeah.  Well [sigh], what else?  [laughter] Well, I think that's just pretty
0 A:  Nice talking to you too.
0 A:  Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES?
0 B:  Yeah.  I've seen that, that's, uh, that was a really good movie.  Probably
0 one of the best things about it was the scenery and, uh, I thought the story
0 was pretty good, too.  I, I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it.
0 A:  Have you ever lived in that part of the country?
0 A:  Have you ever visited it?
0 WOLVES was filmed.
0 A:  I think it was the black hills of South Dakota.
0 B:  Could be.  I, n-, I haven't been to South Dakota.  Have, have you been up
0 A:  Well, I lived in Omaha for five,
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  winters,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  and that rolling kind of, uh,
0 B:  Terrain.
0 A:  Yeah.  Is, is ((fairly famili-,)).  The thing that I thought was
0 interesting was that the critics, apparently it's going to win everything.
0 B:  Really?
0 A:  Uh, and I had been told, you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three
0 hours long, and all this,
0 B:  That's true.
0 A:  kind of,
0 B:  I agree with that.  Um, I, I noticed yesterday in the paper, something
0 said that it, I think it's been nominated for twelve awards and, and all the
0 critics initially said that, you know, it wouldn't go anywhere, that it was
0 A:  Well, the interesting thing was is I had heard that, and I, I, I tend to, I
0 think, overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great.  And,
0 and --
0 A:  -- it was, the thing is, it was, it was a good story.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  And, and, and I guess that's what I really like.  Although, I must admit I
0 did look at my watch after about an hour.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?
0 B:  Y-, you have to go see that one.  And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB?
0 A:  No,
0 B:  I do.  I go every weekend [laughter].  I, I, uh, those are two definite
0 A:  Well, isn't, isn't SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, isn't that a, i-, is it, is it
0 a terror movie or is it just suspenseful?
0 B:  It's suspenseful.  I don't think it's very t-, I mean, there's not really
0 any, uh, blood and guts in it or anything like that.  It's, it's more
0 movie, if, if somebody's not into that kind of stuff.  It's, it's pretty
0 graphic at points.  But, uh, I think they're both excellent movies.
0 A:  Do you, do you listen to Gary Cogill?
0 B:  No.  Huh-uh.
0 A:  Is, uh, do you know who he is?
0 B:  Yeah.  Somebody in South Carolina told me about him.
0 on channel eight in Dallas.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And he does, uh, he has a talk show on the, K L I F.  Anyway, it's on from
0 seven to nine, or something.  And, and, and people call in and it's, if you
0 keep up with movies, it's kind of interesting.  There's a certain a mount of
0 dribble that they do.  They've got, uh, they've got a couple of kids, ten or
0 twelve years old, and they call in and they review movies.  But it's, uh --
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  -- he, anyway, he, it's interesting.  You listen to him and then you, you
0 go watch the movie.  In fact, they had, people had just seen, I was listening
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I was going to pick up my daughter.  But, anyway, it was, uh, the, it,
0 it's interesting, though, the, the difficulty with, with DANCING WITH WOLVES
0 is that when you make a movie like that, and you produce it, and then you star
0 in it, uh, the question is, did he, did he really know it was going to be good
0 or did he just do it?
0 B:  I think that, I think he really, his heart was in it, but I, I don't think
0 he really knew it was going to be as big as it was.  I think it was something
0 it.  You know, he, he enjoyed the story line and I think he just really w-, he
0 really wanted it.  And whether it, whether it won all kinds of awards or
0 whether it just was okay at the box office, I think he would have been happy.
0 Because I think that, I think he did a good job and, and the self-satisfaction
0 A:  Do you know who the guy was that was playing the, uh, the, the wagon
0 B:  [Lipsmack] Um.
0 A:  A little piece of trivia.  You know, the guy when he first headed out from
0 the army post.
0 B:  Yeah.  Who, no I don't know who that guy is.
0 A:  He, he plays [laughter] on MURPHY BROWN.
0 B:  Oh, he does?
0 A:  Yes.  He's, --
0 B:  As a recurring character every week?
1 B:  Oh.
0 A:  [Laughter] Can you,
0 B:  No,
0 A:  believe that?
0 B:  now see, I'd, I'd a never put those two together.
0 A:  That's, [laughter] that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that
0 somebody said, did you notice that?
0 B:  Huh-uh.
0 A:  I thought, no, it's really funny.  But I thought, it, it, you think back,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- you know, with the beard and all that stuff.  I mean, it's, uh,
0 B:  Yeah, real scruffy looking [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.  Real scruffy looking,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 was a lot of fun.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 @@A:  I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at

0 guess, yeah.  Does it usually cut off?  Is that what,
0 A:  Well, I don't know.
0 B:  it does?
0 A:  Why do we end this thing?
0 A:  I think it just says hang up.
1 is over just say your good-byes and hang up.  So,
0 B:  I, I guess so.  Okay.
0 A:  Good-bye Sharon.
0 of talking about what privacy is, um, if privacy is something that disturbs
0 your private state, I mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs
0 into your private state and extracts information from it, in other words,
0 of, the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me, and very much everyday in
0 this country, but in the second time, at least overtly, uh, where someone
0 comes in and, uh, finds out information about you that should be private, uh,
0 @B:  I, I think I agree with that.  I think in a good example on the typical
0 thing that happens, uh, when the phone rang and it's T I calling, my immediate
0 oh, no, this is something I solicited,
0 A:  That's right [laughter].
0 B:  so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that
0 I realized, no, I, I really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  that was almost an example of s-, an invasion that turns out to be not
0 invasive.
0 A:  Right, it turned out to be, uh, uh, an invitation.
0 of, uh, probably, seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes
0 that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it.
0 A:  From, from personal parties or from these, um, phone answer, phone, uh,
0 A:  commercial things.  
0 B:  sol-, solicitations primarily.  
0 A:  Oh, that, that's a remarkable number.  I get them rarely and I'm still
0 astounded that, that one, they let anyone do them and two, that they have any
0 effect in this whatsoever [laughter].  Um, because I'm usually so insulted by
0 them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  they are.  I think they prey on people's, um, inherent politeness on the
0 phone even with the machine.  I find people being kind of polite and waiting
0 for it to finish what it has to say, and then they feel an obligation to
0 B:  And I think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems
0 to be little control and you, one's feeling obligated,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, and, uh, that, that then ends up being the, the most common example
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Um, I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to
0 this second, this one that you raised.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And I don't think I would have thought about that.  I think that's a good
0 idea on your part.  I don't typically feel intruded on, on the things, uh, the
0 sense of finding out information.
0 don't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties
0 trying to do it without your knowledge.  So there's, [lipsmack], things that
0 invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly
0 and I can't talk about the second one other than to, to, to generate paranoia
0 [laughter].  It's a surmise and,
0 B:  To, to surmise.  It is there.
0 A:  I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country.  I don't
0 B:  Well, I guess, although, I, well, that's a good point where you said that
0 how does one define what invasion of privacy is,
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah.
0 B:  because, uh, if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest and I'm
0 not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense
0 A:  Uh-huh,
0 B:  Uh,
0 A:  uh-huh, uh-huh.   
0 B:  if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something
0 you don't know about it, well, then I guess one could assume one was invaded
0 but I don't feel invaded by it.
0 B:  I don't,
0 B:  have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things, I'm not
0 sure why.  Uh, I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts and if someone
0 finds out something about me that is true, I, I don't have a sense of loss
0 from that.
1 A:  Uh-huh. Well, you must have a relatively clean conscience then [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] Um, the, the other side of that might be if, if someone found
0 out something or surmised something that weren't true then I would feel
0 probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.
0 B:  Bec-, right, because,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 Lotus data base that was being put together?
0 it.
0 B:  That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I
0 would find that there be, cou-, a good possibly that their facts were, were
0 fantasy.
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had
0 obtained information from a, that I would rather they didn't and that might be
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  that, that I would have thought to be private.  But then if it turns out
0 to generate incorrect things, that's even worse so,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
1 because [laughter],
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  uh, someone had, had,
0 A:  They had you pegged [laughter].
0 B:  Right.  And the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays
0 money and then all of,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  their advertising you.  Right.  Exactly.
0 A:  Yeah.  And, um, one of the problems with the Lotus data base was, um, that
0 it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information.  I mean, they
0 said they would give it out to only select companies but, um, you know, just
0 like software is only given out to customers, I mean, you can't believe that.
0 A:  [Laughter] It would, it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to
0 check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering, you know, full cash
0 price,
0 A:  for it.  I mean, you know, you can't tell it, what a company really has
0 to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having virtually
0 anyone, any hacker being able to know what your income is, what your spending
0 habits are, and, you know, and, and that hacker just has to get in to, in
0 touch with the sneak thief and suddenly and then what started as an invasion
0 of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  And I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  threatened as a result of, of it so,
0 A:  Yes. Exactly.
0 B:  maybe that is a, a little bit of what privacy is.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  I also thought about it, was of, uh, waiting to talk to you that,
0 have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy.
0 yelling or something, someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly.
0 A:  And I realize that that, I mean, I can take that for granted but I used to,
0 I used to live in India and things are quite different there in terms of that.
0 There's less of a sense of privacy.  In fact, it's said that no Indian
0 language has a word for privacy, certainly the language I know doesn't,
0 B:  Oh, that's interesting.
0 A:  but just says a word for loneliness.  Loneliness is the closest you can
0 come, which is really quite different.
0 B:  But, but no concept for wanting to be private.
0 A:  Yeah.  It's, it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state, at
0 least officially.
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  Um, so there's not, I mean, doors don't have latches on them.  People don't
0 tend to knock, you just, if there's a door closed and you open it because it's
0 in your way you, people walk in out and, as a, as a westerner in India, and I
0 B:  Oh.  That, that would be,
0 A:  and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded.  
0 B:  That would be culturally shocking [laughter].
0 out on the street and act like a complete lunatic,
0 A:  and people would leave,  
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  me alone.  Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed
0 doors very much, if you go out and then act like the lunatic you, you violate
0 paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in the
0 sense are invite-, invade, invading your privacy although, if you know what
0 the social norms are, you know, quote unquote, you asked for it.  But it does
0 mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms.
0 was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something
0 that's culturally relative.
0 B:  Tha-, that is true.  I haven't thought about that and, and that it's
0 fascinating to, to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private.
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And that's really, um, well, I mean, I, I wonder how
1 people have sex,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 there, I still don't quite understand how certain things that I assume and
0 require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you
0 have a sense of privacy.
0 A:  Because anyone can be alone for some period of time but for me a lot of
0 what I do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which
0 B:  Yes.
0 A:  will respect.  And if that's gone, um, I, I really don't know how to live
0 very well, and I wonder, I really do wonder how people do that.
0 B:  That's interesting.  Are th-, are there any other specific things that,
0 that you feel like, where, where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a
0 A:  All the class-, the other classic examples, the Jehovah's Witness or, or
0 Mormons or someone knocking at the front door, um, which is more intrusive
0 because I have to really tell someone to go away. And there's that sense of, I
0 have now opened my door they now see what I look like, what I live like and
0 nor-, and they're doing something that normally I really only invite,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  people to.  Because I, any, anyone, any friend, anyone I give my number
0 to is welcome to call me, but no one is just welcome to come by my house.  So
0 that is more of a sense of invasion.
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  Fine.  Kind of tired. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Me too. 
0 B:  Pardon me? 
0 A:  Where are you? 
0 A:  Lewisville.  Okay, I'm in Garland.  [lipsmack] Um, have you read
0 anything about how they propose to, uh, come up with the taxes to increase the
0 funding for schools?
0 @B:  A little bit. 
0 A:  What do you think about it, equalization of funding?  [TV] {in
0 background} [breathing] {heavy}.
0 B:  That's a hard issue to decide, um, on the one hand, you don't want to have
0 to take away.  But, on the other hand, you don't want, uh, the poorer school
0 districts to go under either.  And, uh, here in Lewisville, they had a thing
0 on the ballot that they wanted to, uh, rollback the taxes on everybody's
0 houses,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and everybody would save, uh, twenty dollars a year, or whatever but it
0 would cut back to one million dollars in, to the schools.  And, I happened to
0 know a good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it
0 because that would just take away all, all their money.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  [Breathing] {heavy}.
0 B:  you know, Texas is known for it's poor schools and that's too bad because
0 we got little kids and we're, uh, not too pleased about that.
0 A:  But we're not funding them like other states either, though. you know it?
0 B:  Pardon me? 
0 A:  We're not funding our schools like other states either.
0 B:  That's true. 
0 that's going to solve the problem.
0 B:  Yeah, I know, 
0 A:  I mean, I think there's a lot {loud breathing},
0 B:  that's, that's only part of the problem.
0 A:  of waste in, in schools.
0 B:  I think we're going s-,
0 A:  I'm a teacher [laughter]. I feel that,
0 A:  Yes.  I def-,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  definitely feel that way.  All this,
0 B:  #I think were going to see a day com-,#
0 A:  #money that's being paid for it's administrators.#
0 A:  Huh-uh.  I can,
0 B:  I think, I think we're just going to see a day when s-, uh, grade schools
0 are going to be charging tuition, just like colleges are.  Uh, and it will
0 only be to those who are having kids going to school, that's probably the most
0 fair way.  But, you know, uh, that way old people don't have to have, have
0 money going into their schools because they don't have little kids going to
0 schools.  But, uh, I wouldn't be surprised if that happens within the next few
0 years, uh, that sort of thing happening.  And, uh,
0 A:  Well,
0 B:  we'll see what happens. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  that's an idea. 
0 B:  Yes.  Um, I don't know.  That, I think, has pluses and minuses, because,
0 uh, those that are economically disadvantage won't have the ability to make a
0 choice [laughter].
0 B:  The choice will be thrust upon them.  And so where is the freedom of
0 choice?  No, freedom of choice in that case and that's,
0 [laughter] Um, like in Garland, they get to choose the schools that they are
0 going to go to, but they got to have the transportation to them if it's out of
0 A:  So, and I like that,
0 A:  because you can find out the good schools in your area.
0 it is to have equal funding for every school in the state, whether you, it's
0 in a poor tax district or a high tax district, and, uh, that's the only way
0 that I can see it's going to be resolved, is there are going to be people in
0 the rich district that are going to fight that and, and it's going to be a
0 real bad mess because there's people on every side of the problem.
0 A:  So, just distribute it equally,
0 B:  Yes. 
0 A:  and not raise taxes?
0 B:  And they said give every teacher a, a hundred percent raise.  Tha-, that's
0 the problem is the teachers don't get enough money and anybody who could be a
0 enough.  I mean, when I was in college, I did a lot of teaching, uh, for my
0 degree, and, uh, I got a lot of good out of that and I liked teaching, but I
0 really couldn't go into teaching because it was not economically feasible for
0 me to do so.
0 A:  Yeah.  What do you do? 
0 B:  I'm a mathematician. 
0 B:  Pardon me. 
0 A:  You picked a good field. 
0 B:  Oh, I don't know. 
1 B:  There are better fields to pick. 
0 A:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  
0 B:  I mean,
0 B:  Yeah, where I, you know, the kind of stuff I do, I, I use my education
0 all depends.  I mean, it depends on where you wind up, I guess.  But I really
0 enjoyed teaching it.  You know I, I wouldn't mind getting back into it
0 someday, but, who knows what will happen in the future.  The way people are
0 being laid off right and left, it's all a matter of, uh, what happens next.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  But, uh, ba-, back to the taxes, though.  I mean, uh, it's, uh, a difficult
0 issue.  No one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand, you got to do
0 something.
0 A:  What do you think about a state income tax? 
0 B:  I can see that there might be a reason for one, but I would hate to do that
0 because, uh, that would be very difficult for my family, financially, to, to
0 states that have had it.  But, way, way financing is now, if we had a state
0 income tax, I'd, uh, have a very hard time financing my house again.  You
0 know, paying off my mortgage each month.  That's, so that's the problem.  Um,
0 which just matter of we'll see what happens.  I'd rather have that, I guess,
0 than have a state lottery.  Because when you bring,
0 not?
0 B:  No.  It didn't. 
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  Which means there's a higher probability of now having a state income tax,
0 even though good old taxes (( )) my favorite, uh, decided that during the
0 see what happens.  I don't know.  At any rate, uh,
0 A:  So what about your income tax?  Think they're hitting you too hard?
0 B:  Actually, no.
0 this year which is, which is nicer than having to pay out, uh, which is a
0 matter of, uh, uh, I, I'm surprised it's, well, considering the national
0 budget, I think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars for the
0 national budget.  And for a family of four like what I got that comes out to
0 over twenty-two thousand dollars that we, it, it's our share to pay in.  But
0 I'm not paying that much income tax.
0 thousand dollars, or whatever, coming in?  Wh-, how, how is that coming from
0 me?  I guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot.  But, it's
0 point four and then the rest goes to, to the national debt.
0 A:  This just keeps accumulating.  [breathing] {heavy} I don't know.  What else
0 do you think about them, let's see, state?
0 B:  That's about it, I guess. 
0 A:  And the city tax, the sale tax.  They used to, you really didn't even think
0 anything about it when you bought something.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  But now you do [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah, Yeah.
0 A:  (( )) What is it, seven point?
0 B:  Seven percent, or something.  It depends on where you're at.  Some places
0 in Dallas, I guess it's like closer to eight and places like in Lewisville is
0 a lot closer to seven.
0 A:  I don't even know how they figure it, really. 
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  I'm glad I don't work in a store. 
0 B:  How's that? 
0 A:  Because I wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something
0 B:  Oh, yeah.  That's the way to do it. 
0 A:  All right.  So you think federal taxes, okay.  State tax, you can see the
0 logic of it but you don't think it would be economically feasible for your
0 B:  No. 
0 A:  And ours, see, both of us are teachers and we got four in our family, too.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  So when you start,
0 A:  anymore.
0 B:  taking, talking taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state
0 A:  But we can do this tax sheltered annuity, that's the only thing that's
0 saving us.
0 B:  Yeah.  I think what we ne-, what, uh, the government, the state government
0 needs to do is get in there and cut spending.  Because when they got all this
0 fraud and waste going on, they need to just get in there and, and get out the
0 A:  [Laughter] [breathing].
0 B:  if they gave all that money directly to the people, every welfare recipient
0 would be making like forty-five thousand dollars a year.  And you know they're
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  on the welfare.  So, where is the other ninety percent going?  Well, it's
0 going to the, some fat guy in the middle who's sitting there on his behind all
0 day doing nothing but filling out papers.
0 A:  Lots and lots of people. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0 poor, you know, socioeconomic areas, homes, and it's just like, they always
0 have money.  They, they always are dressed nice, you know, most of them are,
0 fairly nice.  Not like you would think a, a poor person would be.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 know, dollars on them and everything.  And I'm thinking, you know, this isn't
0 right because my children don't have that.
0 B:  Yeah.  Well I don't have that [laughter].  A lot of times if I've got a
0 A:  Yeah.  And you give them, you know, they get their free lunch and they
0 throw most of it away.  But, then, they have their money to go buy desert and
0 that they eat.

0 A:  [Laughter]  Yeah, it's, it's a hard decision to make.
0 B:  It really is, uh, the only problem I have with gun control is that they,
0 the radicals want to ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people
0 carrying guns are going to be, be the people who are going to kill you anyway.
0 A:  Like the bumper sticker [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah, exactly. 
0 B:  Right, it really is, because they're going to get them one way or another.

0 A:  No, I, yeah, I, I, I agree that it would be like people in, people that
0 are criminals are the ones that are going to get them and then you have no
0 defense against these people when they do,

0 A:  come into your house, or something.

0 of one, how to act around one when they buy them.
0 A:  Yeah, have, have gun, have, have gun management one o one [laughter].

0 B:  Yes, yes. Is, is that one that you're talking about. 
0 A:  That was the big one I'm talking about.  I work weird hours, and
0 invariably just about the time, I'm going to sleep, the phone tears off the

0 A:  or you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that
0 they've read probably a thousand times that day already.

0 A:  What I would love to see done to stop all of this,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  we've got a thing in this country, you can have your phone number
0 unlisted, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 think it's great, that you know, freedom of speech in this country and
0 message, everything, they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like
0 of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I
0 don't even understand.  So, yeah, I do, I really feel that's, uh, an invasion
0 see.
0 A:  That's about, that as far as any other everyday occurrences, I put a stop
0 to some of them as far as the door to door, either religious groups, or
0 people peddling products.  If I wanted their products, I would have
0 either gone to the store to bought it, or I would have called for their
0 salesman to come out.
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, that's true.  Living in an apartment complex though,
0 you know you can't, um, you can't really stop those people from coming around
0 they still come up to the front door and, uh, you know, walk around. So,
0 usually what I do is I'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey,
0 or, or they're from a religious organization and I really hate that.  I
0 really, really do.  I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago and,
0 uh, gosh it was about nine o'clock at night, too.  It wasn't even what I would
0 consider, you know, family hours, time to, you know, start going to bed and
0 uh, and it was somebody from, um, oh what was it, the, uh, Jesus Christ of
0 Latter Day Saints, and uh, I've read a lot about, uh, that particular sect and
0 I don't particularly care for it, so I especially don't like for them to come
0 up to my door and, and try and talk to me.
0 A:  Now, I agree with their right to, uh, [TV] pursue their religion of choice,
0 the sanctity of the American home, whether it be in a house or in an
0 apartment.  I'm on my turf, if I want them there, I'll call for them,
0 otherwise, I don't want to know they exist.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, no, I, I agree with you there.  If they want to choose that
0 particular religion that's fine with me too, you know, as long as they don't
0 try and pull me in and drag me in.  And, and I don't like the way that they do
0 it either, and, and, it's their mission that they do it.  They go door to door
0 and they go out into the public and they actually have the, uh, teenagers
0 around and doing missionary type work and, uh, I don't know, I just, um, don't
0 particularly care for that at all.  And that, that's one thing that I feel
0 really strongly about though, is, uh, you know, people coming up to my door,
0 and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh, you know, to try and
0 get me to join or, you know, become interested in their religion, because I
0 A:  Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that
0 says no soliciting, I've even gone so far as to put that, I've got a storm
0 door on the front of the house and I've put, in, I don't know how much clearer
0 it can be, it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting.  I
0 should have, I guess I should make another one that says religious or
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, yeah, that's true, yeah.  No I don't, uh, I don't have, I
0 didn't go that far but, uh, yeah I probably could do the same thing, uh, you
0 know, I don't have a storm door, but I'm sure I could rig up something.  But
0 word and it says go [laughter], instead of stop.  Oh, goodness.
0 A:  I wonder if there would be some way we could get these people to do this
0 get their names, their addresses, and their phone numbers and then reverse it,
1 and do, well that would be technically illegal, it would be harassment.
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh gosh.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  a harassment in itself.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true, um.  Well what else?
0 A:  I believe we've pretty much summed everything up. 
0 B:  I know, but I remember you, you talked about something, you started off and
0 said, well let me think, you talked about the telephone calls and people
0 coming and soliciting and selling things at the door.  You said something
0 else.  I can't remember what it was, and I thought yeah, that, that kind of
0 touched a nerve right there, but we got uh, we got to talking about the, uh,
0 uh, people coming to you at the front door.
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh goodness, okay, is our five minutes up?
0 A:  Uh, pretty close to it.  
0 B:  Well it was nice talking to you too Jim.
0 A:  And take it easy now.
0 B:  Okay, thanks, bye.
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  -- after being in school and so, we're just first time homeowners.  We've
0 only been living here about six months.
0 about, uh, twenty-five and a half years, twenty-six years.
0 A:  Oh, boy.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  We've been in it for, uh, about thirteen, fourteen years, I think now, in
0 Richardson [clicking] {from phone}.
0 B:  We've lived in the Richardson for that, you know, for the full time.
0 B:  Uh.
0 A:  Well what do you find it having to be like out there.  I've always
0 heard that it was expensive.
0 B:  Well, it's, it's not really all that bad.  Uh, I think you live in
0 Plano, so, uh, the, the Plano area and the Richardson area probably are, are
0 about the same,
0 A:  Oh really.
0 B:   price wise, I would think.
0 A:  Uh, well we, uh, when we graduated from school in Houston, uh, my husband
0 us here and, um, we had, um, heard a lot about Richardson being a good
0 area,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  and the homes there being really nice, and, but we kind of just got the
0 impression that it was out of our price range.
0 B:  Yeah, well, um, well I, I think that there some areas in, you know,
0 in, uh, Richardson that may be a little bit higher priced, but, uh, of course,
0 it, like I said, it's been thirteen years since we've really priced a
1 house so [laughter],
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  so I'm not sure what the prices are like now.  Uh, I know that
0 our price, that the, the value of our house went up, you know,
0 considerably over a, uh, you know, oh, an eight or ten year period but
0 then for the last several years, it's pretty well stabilized, uh,
0 perhaps even dropped back some from what it was, so.
0 A:  Really, um.
0 B:  But, uh, we've done, uh, you know, in order to maintain ours, we've done
0 some remodeling and stuff, you know, just to, to kind of change, do some, some
0 little changes occasionally, so, uh.
0 A:  Yeah, well that makes sense.
0 B:  But, uh, I guess, I, I'm a little encouraged with home prices.
0 I, I'm a C P A and I was just talking to one of my clients, uh,
0 yesterday, or uh, you know, over the last couple of days and they have
0 was, was more reasonably priced.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  It's in Dallas but it's in the Richardson School District.
0 B:  And, the, the lady is very pleased, you know, she says it's got
0 several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so,
0 A:  Oh that's good.
0 B:  so, I, I suppose that the housing market is, uh, you know, it is on
0 the, on the down side right now.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well do you have a lot of homes out there that have, uh,
0 foundation problems.  That seems to be the, pretty much the rule out here.
0 B:  Well, I'm not really aware of those, I do know that, that our
0 replaced twice because, uh, apparently the foundation shifts a little bit
0 under that.  But that was a design problem, because we put, and we
1 designed the house, so it's our fault, 
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  but we had them put the shower on a corner, uh, uh, like our
0 house is built in a U shape and in, inside that U but on one of the
0 corners, uh, is where that shower is, and so,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  any shifting in the foundation, of course, or, or, you know, I
0 guess I feel that way, anyway, that, that shifting would cause some
0 problems in that, in that area of the house.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of, uh, of metal
0 or plastic, whichever it is anyway, so.
0 A:  So did it looked cracked to you, I mean that's how you knew it was
0 broken.
0 B:  No, it, uh, it started leaking through the, you know, out through
0 the pan and out on to the floor and soaking up in the sheet rock, and 
0 things (( )).
0 A:  Oh, so that's, that's how you knew. 
0 scared about everything like that, 
0 B:  Yeah, uh,
0 A:  going wrong, and how do you know it's going to happen and all.
0 B:  but, uh, yeah, but I think, uh, you know I think so far as, uh, as
0 the location, Richardson Plano are probably comparable.  The school
0 districts are, you know, are about the same, uh, you know, quality wise.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  We really like our school out here.  
0 B:  Yeah so,  
0 A:  But we, um, we were scared to buy hou-, a house in our neighborhood
0 because all of the homes did have these foundation problems,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and we didn't know, uh, you know, if we were afraid, that we'd be
0 living there and all of a sudden the house would crack in half and
1 split open or something.
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, but, uh, well, our house, and I'm not sure how all of
0 them, you know, how most of the builders do, but ours is what they
0 know, that run through the foundation,
0 A:  Uh.
0 B:  and once they get the foundation poured, then they, they apply
0 tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete and makes it
0 more, uh, more stable and, and puts more strength into it.
0 B:  So, uh, you know, it [clicking], it, uh, potentially that's
0 supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the, you
0 know, when the, the earth itself shifts around, so.
0 B:  Yeah so,
0 A:  Well our house is older, it's like a nineteen sixty-three house
0 that we bought, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  so, I'm not, it doesn't seem like it, uh, I know so much has changed in
0 their technology in the last few years.
0 A:  It's slab.
0 B:  Yeah, so that's, and that's what ours is.  Our, the house we had
0 before was over, we live on the east side of Richardson now and the
0 other one was over on the west side and it was, uh, a pier and beam
0 house and, uh, I just drove by there this morning and it still looks
0 A:  Well that's good.
0 B:  Yeah, so, you know, I think houses, uh, I think they hold up pretty
0 well if you've got a, if you have a good builder [throat_clearing].
0 A:  Yes, my grandfather was a builder and so, my parents always lived
0 in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  I know it was, um, it's got a really good reputation and,
0 course, if I didn't think that way, we wouldn't still be living here
0 A:  Fourteen years that's pretty good.
0 B:  Right definitely.
0 A:  Well, thank you.
0 B:  Okay, thank you, uh.
0 A:  And well, uh, you, go-, good luck with this program then.
0 B:  Okay, thank you, you too.
0 A:  Bye-bye.
0 A:  Hello this is Lois.
0 B:  Hi, hi, this is Lisa.
0 A:  And, uh, I called you know, from that, the, the T I Data Base Calling
0 Instructions.
0 B:  Uh-huh. Yeah, I got a call yesterday too.  This is a different subject
0 A:  Yeah, this is about changes in the women in the, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh, there's really a lot, isn't there.
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].
0 A:  I think there really is.
0 B:  It's kind of an easy thing to talk about.
0 A:  Oh, I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it.
0 B:  Yeah, uh, I think you have to push one and then we can start recording it.
0 A:  Okay [tone].  All right.
0 @B:  Okay.
0 A:  Are you ready now?
0 B:  Yes.
0 A:  Okay, like I said I guess it would be the work force, you know, as far as
0 changes in the generations.
0 B:  Yes, I know because, I know when my mother was a, you know, going into
0 the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her, I guess, she's in
0 her late forties.  You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids
0 and I've never faced that at all.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  you know, and you stay there.  And I feel like the next generation,
0 you'll probably just work right along with your husband, you know.
0 B:  Yeah, uh-huh, I think it's definitely gotten better.
0 A:  Oh, I do to, much.  And it's just going to get better.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Because women are in every field now, I mean I can't think of a field that
0 they're not involved in.
0 A:  Oh, I can't either, not a one.
0 B:  And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out
0 women have gotten into the doctor field.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing.
0 A:  Yeah, even in Washington, you know,
0 A:  there seems to be a lot more women involved. 
0 B:  Hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue, I mean people
0 will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman, 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 B:  I think that would be the best goal.
0 A:   Oh, I do too, just your qualifications and that would be it.
0 B:  Uh-huh, exactly, not what color you are, how old you are, what your male or
0 female.  That would be wonderful, ((I guess)) it's kind of an ideal world
0 A:  Yeah, I kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social
0 security numbers, you know,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female,
0 female over a male, you know,
0 B:  Exactly, or the way you look, or the way you, you know,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 B:  your age or anything.
0 B:  I think that would be a wonderful way to do it.
0 A:  I do to just go by your social security number and then look at you
0 qualifications that, you know, that you have. 
0 B:  Uh-huh, and then,
0 A:  And then if you get it, you know then,  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job,
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  or,  
0 A:  As a matter of fact, that's what I'm doing.
0 B:  Is it.
0 A:  Uh-huh, it sure is.
0 B:  That would be great.
0 A:  It sure is.
0 B:  Or, a lot of women I know now and my, uh, one of my supervisors, when she
0 went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, uh, uh, a terminal at her house
0 and she, you know, we could send her messages, and, and she kept in touch like
0 that,
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  and basically, just worked out of her house.  I would just take her
0 the actual paperwork once, uh, every week or two, and that worked out great
0 too.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah that is.
0 B:  And that's a real attractive option, if you have the, the technology for
0 it.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  All it was, was, you know, I mean, she just used a phone modem and she
0 was like she was sitting in the office, so I think that's real nice too, to
0 come up with different options.   Do you like the job sharing?
0 A:  Oh, I do, 
0 B:  Do you?
0 A:  I really do, I think it's great. 
0 B:  Do you work like half days, or half weeks or, 
0 A:  Uh, well like, one week she'll work three days and I'll work two and the
0 next week, you know, I'll work three and she'll work two,
0 B:  Oh, oh that's great,
0 A:  and we just share off like that.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Do you get the full benefits?
0 B:  Oh, that's wonderful.
0 A:  But we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  that would be great.
0 A:  It really is, and that way we're not really missing any thing out, you
0 know,
0 B:  Either way,
0 A:  of (( )) children, uh-huh.
0 B:  yeah, you have your career and your home life, and that would be a nice
0 way, especially if you have young children.
0 A:  Oh, it is, it is, well both of ours is school age, but we don't want to
0 B:  Uh-huh, oh, no, I think, yeah.  My son's just in day-care but even that
0 they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that
0 you're involved in that.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  I think it's great, I really,
0 B:  Yeah,
0 A:  and I look for more of that in the next generation.
0 B:  I do too, especially as women get up in management and, and can be in on
0 those decision making, you know, when that subject comes up they can say yes,
0 that would be wonderful.
0 days off that you can do everything, so you don't have to, you know, unless
0 A:  Most of the time now, you know, it's just the weekend, or just forget
0 it.
0 B:  Uh-huh, oh yeah, I have to plan way in advance, because, or, what I've
0 done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours.
0 B:  That's been real helpful too, like my doctor stays open til nine in the
0 evening.  So that's real helpful, so you don't, you know, have to do it
0 during office hours, run out on your lunch hour.  I don't know how many times
0 I've done that to do something,
0 A:  To do, yeah.
0 B:  post office or the bank or any kind of errand, so.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well I think we've really come a long way in that because,
0 B:  Uh-huh, I guess I take it for granted, kind of, because, I just, it's
0 always been that way.
0 B:  But I know,
0 A:  Yeah, but I can rem-, remember back growing up, my mother, I mean it was
0 she always worked, but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off.
0 B:  Oh no, I can remember my mother getting in trouble if, you know, one of
0 compared to the work that she did. 
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 B:  I think there is still some discrimination there where as, you know, men
0 B:  but I think that's improving.  It's such a slow process it's frustrating,
0 A:  Yes, yes.
0 B:  you can see that it's wrong and you just want to make it right, but at
0 least the wheels are moving forward.
0 B:  Yeah, I think it's getting better, not worse.  Well, I should probably
0 get back to my job [laughter].
0 A:  I  know, [laughter] I know the feeling.
0 B:  Call again.
0 A:  Okay, I sure will.  Bye-bye.
0 A:  A poodle, miniature or, uh, full size?
0 B:  Yeah, uh, it's, uh miniature.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  I read somewhere that, the poodles is one of the, the most intelligent
0 B:  Well, um, I wouldn't, uh, I definitely wouldn't dispute that, it, it's
0 actually my wife's dog, uh, I, I became part owner six months ago when we got
0 married, but, uh, it, uh, definitely responds to, uh, to authority and, I've
0 had dogs in the past and, uh, it seems, it seems to, uh, respond real well,
0 it, it she's, she's picked up a lot of things, uh, just, just by, uh, teaching
0 by force, I guess is what I'd like to say.
0 A:  Oh, uh-huh.  So, you, you've only known the dog, wh-, how long did you say.
0 B:  Well, about a year I guess.
0 A:  Oh, well, uh, is it, uh, uh, how old is the dog?
0 B:  It just turned two, I believe.
0 A:  Yeah, I have a, uh, well a mutt, myself.  I call it a, uh, uh,
0 ((Chowperd)).
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  It's, uh, part Chow and part Shepherd and it, as I understand it, uh, both
0 sides of the, were thoroughbreds.  So, she's a genuine ((Chowperd)).
0 A:  She has the, the color and the black to-, tongue of a Chow, but, uh, she
0 has the shap-, the shape of the, uh, uh, Shepherd.
0 B:  Oh, that's, that's neat.  How, about how big then?
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  But she's big enough to be intimidating,
0 B:  Most definitely.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  and right from day one, she was teaching me.
1 B:  Oh, I wouldn't doubt it, yeah.
0 A:  [Laughter] She's the most intelligent dog I've ever seen.  Course, I'm a
0 little prejudiced, of course.
0 B:  Well that's understandable, yeah, it's, uh,
0 A:  [Throat_clearing] You know, the first time I brought her home, she was
0 only, uh, was it six weeks old.  And I spread the newspapers out in the
0 kitchen area.
0 A:  But, uh, next morning, she let me know in no uncertain terms that she
0 wanted to use the bathroom.
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  So, on next night, I spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them
0 there.
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  But it wasn't too long until she, uh, found out she could wait until I let
0 her out in the morning.
0 A:  And since then, I, I live alone,
0 B:  Okay.
0 -er, and it's, it's such a pleasure to come home at night and you can see her
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, definitely.
0 A:  And, uh, I don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not. 
0 B:  Yeah, I can honestly say we do, uh, we, uh, just recently put a security
0 system in our house and so now, uh, in order to, uh, to accommodate the motion
0 detectors we have to keep her, uh, uh, locked up in the, the master bedroom
0 during the day and then she's got the, the bedroom and the bathroom to, for
0 free run during the day but,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 when we come walking up to the front door.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  She's definitely ready to get out and run around. 
0 A:  Well my dog's an outdoor type, she does not like to be indoors.
0 B:  Really.
0 B:  Oh wow.
0 A:  But, uh, I do make her come in.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 her on a, uh, on a leash,
0 A:  which is, uh, on sort of a run.  I have a, a thirty foot cable,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  running from one stake to another, and then attached to that is a, uh,
0 A:  so she can cover quite an area.
0 B:  Most definitely.
0 A:  And, uh, she's the best, uh, burglar alarm going.
0 in a dog like that.
0 A:  Oh, yeah, she, uh, it's the strangest thing, though, uh, children, no
0 matter how strange they are, or how new they might be can walk, uh, right up
0 to her,
0 B:  Wow.
0 A:  And I have not discovered yet where the, the line is between children and
0 adults.
0 B:  Yeah, that's interesting. 
0 A:  But, uh, she is a great comfort to me.
0 B:  Yeah, I know our dog has had, uh, some different reactions, she's never
0 really been around children and, uh, if, if the child is, is pretty straight
0 forward, um, she's fine.  If, if a child is a little intimidated, she'll jump
0 around and, and yip and bark quite a bit, and if the child gets scared, uh,
0 she's still trying to play, but she doesn't completely understand what's going
0 on and we've had a little confusion with, with, uh, with younger kids.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But, uh, you know, that's, it's a matter of exposure really.  Um, we, uh,
0 took her home to, uh, my family's place in South Dakota, and she was the one
0 that was intimidated then.  There was about seven kids ranging from about, uh,
0 three years to ten years running around the house all at one time,
0 A:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 B:  you know come to visit Grandpa and Grandma and, the dog kind of, kind of
0 felt out of place then because she was, she was being fed, and everything else
0 from all directions.  She really didn't know how to handle herself.
0 B:  She really did, she just, uh, she, she was alm-, she was just inundated
0 with, with all the attention.  Uh, she, she kind of, she kind of sat and (( ))
0 it all in for a little while and then she'd go get back in and try to play
0 and, and what not, but, uh, it was, it was just such a, such a new experience
0 A:  Uh-huh.  What's her name by the way?
0 B:  Uh, pardon?
0 A:  What, what do you call the dog?
0 B:  Oh, it's, uh, Mitzi.
0 A:  Mitzi.
0 A:  Mine is Gin.
0 A:  As in, uh, martini. 
1 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  [Laughter]  Actually, it's Gin two.
0 B:  I, I see.
0 A:  Because, uh, when I was a teenager, in high school, I had Gin one, but then
0 when I went out in the world, I couldn't take her with me.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had, uh, a similar, uh, experience.  I, I grew up on a
0 farm so I always had, uh, outdoor pets and,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  uh, the dog I had when I moved to Dallas about five years ago was a, uh,
0 Springer Spaniel, black Lab cross.  And he was a real, a real lovable type,
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 A:  Oh, what a shame.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 @@A:  Well Randy, we've just about used up our time here,  
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  and I must say it was interesting.
0 B:  Most definitely.
0 A:  I enjoyed talking about pets with you.
0 B:  Well that's great.
0 A:  Maybe we'll get together again in the future.
0 B:  That sounds real good.
0 B:  You too.
0 B:  Hi, um, okay what, now, uh, what particularly, particularly what kind of
0 in, in my car, so, I, I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a
0 lot because I don't like commercials.  But,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  uh, I find myself listening to popular music, and, uh, quite honestly, I,
0 lot of nursery rhyme music here lately, but that's not by my choice.
0 B:  Oh, really.
0 A:  How about you?
0 laughing}, experience to share [laughter].
0 A:  Lucky you.
0 B:  I, I do, I do listen to a lot of, you know, I do, I switch the stations a
0 lot because I don't have a cassette player in my car.
0 A:  Um, um. Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh, uh, however, I, I do, I do like a lot of different forms of music so I
0 switch quite often.  Um, I think I like, I, I'm really particular about the
0 type of music that I listen to.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But, the, uh, there's such a wide selection, I think I like a lot, I like a
0 little bit of a lot of different types of music.  You know, I, I, I like music
0 that is, that I feel if it is performed correctly or if it's done right, or if
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  How do you feel about rap music?
0 B:  Rap.
0 A:  It seems to be so popular these days.
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, I, I don't really have anything against rap music.  I, the one
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  or, if it's, uh, violence oriented.
0 A:  Right.
0 ago I, 
0 A:  When it was really just starting.
0 B:  Yeah, right when it was just starting, 
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  I heard what was called talking blues,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  which actually is rap.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, uh, it was about, the, the piece of music, the piece of music was
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  And, um, you, you listen a lot, if you, if you hear a lot of old gospel,
0 uh, uh, especially well, the black gospel.  You know, you will, you know, you
0 can really pick it up.  I mean,
0 A:  Yeah, you really.  It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music.
0 A lot of times you'll hear songs that you know, they're not original,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 so much different and yet, I, I have a much younger sister who listens to a
0 the words to songs that she's listening to, and yet,
0 A:  she thought they were brand new,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  original pieces.
0 B:  they, they do, they do copy versions, they do cover versions of, of, you
0 know, like standards, I guess you could call it.
1 A:  That's right.
0 B:  [Laughter] I think it's kind of absurd, you know, the fact that, you know,
0 they don't really, they don't really give, you know, the original artist, or
0 A:  No.
0 B:  the credit that is really due to them.
0 A:  Yeah, I guess there was even a, a bit of ruckus caused by the M C Hammer,
0 who's really, you know,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  seems to be the hot one of, of today.  He used, um, WILD THING.  Do you
0 remember that, that song.
0 A:  he used, um, I can't remember who the artist was on that.
0 B:  Jimi Hendrix was the original. 
0 B:  Jimi Hendrix was the original.  He wrote [noise],
0 was a living person that I'm, I'm thinking of that,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  um, that said, "You know, hey that, those are my words."  And, uh, I
0 guess that they, because they hadn't originally gotten, um, permission,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 paid them his royalties every time the, the song goes on but, 
0 Lee Hooker song, or something,
0 A:  Maybe so.  I,
0 B:  I mean it was just like, it was really old. 
0 A:  I, can't think.
0 B:  I mean I, I, there are a lot, there are so many different songs, I mean
0 like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times.  I mean I've heard
0 some songs that, that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of, I'm
0 like, you know, I, I don't want to listen to this.
0 B:  [Laughter] Because you know, you think of the original is like, you know,
0 oh, that was really great.  That was a, you know, a really good piece of work,
0 and then when you hear the cover it's like, you know, God, what are they
0 doing.
1 A:  Right. They destroyed it.
0 A:  Oh, yeah!
0 B:  and, then the cover version, I think, I mean, I thought, was absolutely,
0 it was pitiful.
0 A:  I, I remember seeing the video of it on M T V, and I thought it was
0 A:  It was, ugh, I didn't like that either.
0 B:  Yeah, but you know, whatever became of Peter Frampton.  I mean, there was
0 nothing, he was a phenomenon, I me-, there was no reason for him to really
0 come into, you know, great stardom or anything.
0 A:  I remember, I saw him in a concert, when I was,
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think, I think it,
0 B:  Yeah, I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a
0 good stage performer.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  He was very good.  I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in, uh,
0 Philadelphia.  It was in J F K Stadium, if I can remember.
0 B:  Oh man.
0 A:  Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like.
0 B:  but, but I've really, I, I loved, I mean, I was, I was really into the
0 album oriented music, even then,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 music.  Um, the album oriented like the, uh, James Taylor,
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 they're better than the Beatles, and I'm like, you know,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  you don't know what you're talking about.
0 A:  No [laughter].
0 [laughter].  It was just,
0 A:  You can only laugh [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, you just sort of, you know, well I guess I can just humor them, you
0 know [laughter].  At this point.
0 A:  Right [laughter] well, they, I guess our age is showing when, we, we think
0 B:  Yeah, but well, you know, I, I, I've liked a lot of the new music.  I
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  um, when I saw some promise, you know, with, with a lot of the new wave,
0 when it, when it came out, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  back in the mid and early eighties.  And then, um, I don't know music is
0 kind of in a weird, it's in a very weird position right now.  I think that, I
0 mean, I like, you know, things like to hear, you know, what they call world
0 music.  Which is, you know, using all these natural forms of music and, 
0 A:  Like Paul Simon.  Like,
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, Paul Simon.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Well, you know, really that's not world music.  But, what, what Paul
0 Simon's doing, I think is, is, is great because he's, you know I think, I
0 think that using, I guess what they call it is eclectic, you know.
0 of a new type of music.  Um,
0 B:  Well, world music is, um, a lot of the, a lot of where they, where they
0 make music that they adapt to a, to another kind of, to another type of
0 listener.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh, for example, let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of
0 music and, with a certain style, and then you try to make it a little bit more
0 and,
0 A:  Um.
0 best of every type of music.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Because, I mean, there are some, I mean, I, I li-, there are some, you
0 know, types of heavy metal that I really like, but, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't
0 B:  I, I think, you know, and it's the same way with, you know, world music
0 takes the forms that have really been, um, I guess, I you know, the best
0 example or, you know, the cream of the crop, I guess you could say, and then,
0 and then taking those, those qualities, and then applying, in the styles, that
0 A:  So then it becomes a kind of music of, of it's own, so to speak, or, uh,
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, it becomes a kind of music of it's own.  I mean, when you
0 listen to it, it's um, uh, I think that they don't use, elec-, some of it,
0 it's, they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  so, you know, well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa
0 now, and from West Africa, that's considered world music, because it's not
0 particularly using certain types of folk styles.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  But, they're, they're trying to make it somewhat more modern.  I, I, I, a
0 good, another good example was I heard Miles Davis, and Miles Davis worked
0 with Robbie Shoncar,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  if you can believe it, I mean,
0 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].
0 B:  [Static] [laughter] You know, he's a jazz performer, and then he's playing
0 with Robbie Shoncar, who's a very good, he's a very good arranger.  Uh,
0 arrangement to, uh, we're going to have to get off.
0 A:  The, are they trying to (( )),
0 B:  I don't know. But, uh,
0 A:  (( )) We've talked our five minutes though.
0 incredible.
0 A:  I've been listening to that a lot lately.
0 B:  Yeah, I, I listened and, I heard, you know, you hear this guitar, and then
0 you hear the muted trumpet.  I me, and you never would think that they, that
0 they can actually play together but,
0 A:  and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of
0 over or under for each month and then basically since then what I've done is,
0 coming in, the check coming in, [child_talking] then how much I'm spending
0 is once a month, that's our, our biggest, uh, expense so I take half of that
0 amount out of my checkbook each, with each paycheck,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  even thought it's really still there,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  so that I can keep, uh, uh, good balance,
0 B:  A running total.
0 A:  a running total, yeah through the month,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh, we've, we've, uh, taken how much we have, you know, write down how much
0 we have coming in each month and then, uh, we've, at the beginning of the year
0 different accounts like, you know, we've set a budget for each, you know,
0 own fun money and just stuff like that and then we write down each, each time
0 we spend something, we write down in a book and at the end of the month we
0 tally it up to see how close we, you know we, we try to stay within a certain
0 budget, so.
0 A:  Is it, is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well?
0 B:  Um, it takes some, it takes some dedication to do it, but it, it works out
0 real well, so.
0 A:  And, and you're staying within your budget and keep-, 
0 A:  everything is working pretty good.
0 stay within it then we have, uh, you know, a budget for, you know, like we
0 call our slush fund or something and some-, an unexpected comes up, then
0 A:  You don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that.
0 B:  Right, yeah, because we don't, you know, we don't charge anything that we
0 A:  That's a good choice, we've been trying, we're trying to, uh, do that this
0 year.  We've budgeted the money that we used to spend, we were spending on a
0 ((CODA)) account with T I and then money we were also buying stock with for
0 B:  {Talking to someone else in the room} You've got paper under your table.
0 A:  and said we're going to pay off all of our credit cards and, uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  we have, uh, another loan with the bank,
0 A:  and so we hope by the end of this year,
0 B:  To be out of that.
0 A:  that by doing that we'll be free,
0 A:  and clear.  
0 B:  Yeah, the only thing we have, it to pay off is our, is a automobile loan
0 and our house payment, and that's the only thing we ever,
0 A:  What are you all trying to do long term.  
0 B:  Huh.  Oh it's long term.  We just, he ha-, you know, his retirement plan
0 and then to ((CODA)) and stuff like that, that's all we, and you know, we just
0 have our life insurance for right now.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  So, we don't have any long term, you know, in stocks, or anything like that
0 right now, so.
0 A:  Yeah, mostly what we're doing, we've worked, we've done the, uh, ((CODA))
0 account with T I where they, we put in so much a month, and then they, or so
0 B:  Yeah, that's what we're doing.
0 and I have, when I retired from there, or left, I took the money I that I had
0 in mine and put it in an I R A and we had an out, we had an existing I R A so
0 we have, both of us have some money in an I R A that we're also trying to
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and then we're #also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund.#
0 B:  #Yeah, when ever we get enough saved# we stick it in a C D for a while and,
0 then, uh, you know and then when, if we need it we wait until it, it's expired
0 and then so,
0 A:  Yeah.  The other thing that we've done, that, that was really nice to see,
0 out and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and, uh, what we
0 were pla-, what, what our, uh, goals were on a long term budget in terms of
0 retirement, kids college, paying off the house, buying a different house,
0 A:  um, special thing, buying land and building our own house and they did an
0 analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we
0 wanted to look at,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and then gave us a good idea back, you know, some good information back
0 on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals,
0 A:  and, or not, and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and
0 the money we could put in at what time.
0 just our, our life insurance guy has come out, you know, and he's set up, uh,
0 you know, determined how much we need to, you know, we need if something were
0 to happen.
0 A:  Yeah, that, that's the other financial thing I guess that we've done is
0 with our life insurance is, since I'm at home now is, is figuring out, uh,
0 what we would need if something happened to my husband, or what he would need
0 B:  Right, yeah, you know, if, I would sell the, you know, if, he, something
0 would happen to him, I wouldn't stay in Texas, I would, uh, sell the house and
0 move back home, you know, to my home town, and, and, uh, I wouldn't stay here
0 in Texas, so you know, I don't know what he would do.
0 B:  Yeah mine too.
0 A:  Is, is there anything you'd like to add?
0 B:  No, that's about all for mine. 
0 A:  Well it's been nice talking to you. 
0 B:  Nice talking to you too.
0 A:  Bye, bye [/baby].
0 A:  Uh, we got a lot of them, 
0 B:  Oh, yes [laughter]. 
0 A:  too many of them.
1 A:  Yeah, well my husband is real good at using them.
0 I seem too rely on them too much.
0 A:  I don't have any of them, I don't carry them.  He carries them.  I try to
1 take them away from him.
0 B:  [Laughter] Um, it, uh, you know, I seem to, uh, use those more than I do
0 cash, in fact, I'd rather carry the cards than I would the, uh, cash.
0 A:  Well, we got in, uh, spot of trouble with, uh, using the credit cards on
0 gas.
0 B:  Uh, yes.
0 A:  And, uh, that's got us in trouble.
1 B:  Yes, that's real easy to do, I have to watch it.  
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.
0 B:  In fact, yeah, uh, [laughter] we, I can understand that predicament.  Um,
0 they, they've, um, you know, they've made them too easy and too accessible at
0 everything to, to buy,
0 A:  The A T M machines,
0 comes out with the, uh, A T M machine, 
0 B:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh that's good.
0 A:  But, uh, he knows when he's overspends and when he doesn't and he knows
1 that anytime he pop up that credit card [laughter],
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  You know, uh, used the credit card a couple times to pay bills.
0 B:  Oh, yes, yes, uh, and then, then, then, that gets into a vicious circle.
0 B:  As far as, you know, paying off the, the loan that you just got from the
0 B:  Oh, no.  Um, yeah the A T M's they're, but, they're nice though to have, in
0 case you need to get some quick cash, and everything is closed.
0 A:  Yeah, well, yeah, I like them. I, I have to admit I do like my credit
0 cards.  Uh, I love it when he decides to go in a store and buy something for
0 me.
0 B:  Oh that's the best way ((it's used)), [laughter] that's the best way, yes.
0 I think that sort of evens it out as far as, uh, letting them carry it, so, as
0 long as they do buy us something [laughter].
0 little gift and how did you pay for it, credit.  You know, whipped out my
0 B:  And see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we
0 know how much they pay for it.
0 A:  Yeah, I've never thought about it that way.  I don't really look
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Oh, I have to open it, you know, they, mine always charges the flowers so I
0 can always end up saying, oh, you spent too much, you know, and so, yeah.
0 A:  I think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a Nintendo.
0 B:  Oh, those are fun.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  Like credit cards.
0 B:  [Laughter] Just exactly.
0 A:  Oh, no, I never thought of it that way either.  He's, you know, he's
0 addicted to it at times.
0 B:  Oh, it's, it's real easy to get addicted to them, you know, you get out on
0 a shopping frenzy and, uh, just charge it all and then you don't have to write
0 A:  And see, the thing is, you know, he go out and he'll spend it when he
0 card.
0 A:  Yeah, you know, uh, is he going to yell at me for buying this with this,
0 you know.  He's not a yeller though, but he com-, you know, you shouldn't have
0 spent it all on that.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  He likes to buy the kids toys [throat_clearing] with the, uh, credit card
0 too. 
0 B:  Oh yeah that's (( )).
0 A:  You know, he'll go to, by Wal-Mart or something and,
0 always want to get your kids everything and, uh, you don't care how much it
0 costs or what it takes.
0 A:  Yeah, well, uh, I don't know, the, uh, uh, the, uh, Wal-Mart, that's where
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah that's, uh, I always end up going into Wal-Mart and coming
0 out with everything that, uh, I didn't have on the list.  We're just getting
0 more than what we went in for [laughter].
0 A:  We went in for, uh, uh, something for the car one day,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  last week and he went, we went and bought a potty chair, uh, uh, one of
0 those Ninja Turtles for my son, uh, you know, the potty chair for my daughter
0 and he bought, uh, a pair of shoes for me, and, uh, let's see, what else did
0 and he bought them shoes with it, and, uh.
0 B:  Oh, yeah, it's dangerous.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah, it's just too easy to do.  You go in for just one thing.
0 We're, we're infamous about that and so.
1 A:  Yeah, I'll second that.
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh well, yeah, I, well I'm, I'm glad we have credit cards,
0 that's, uh, because in sometimes when there's an emergency it, it comes in
0 handy.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  It's nice to have.
0 A:  I know we had the car break down one time and, uh, the credit card saved
0 helped us a lot there too, so we wouldn't do without them.
0 A:  I don't think we'd live.
0 B:  Huh-uh, no, no, I think it's become too much of an everyday life here.
0 They're a part of it.
0 A:  Yeah, well I've been asking my husband for the credit cards.  I've got all
1 of them but one.
0 A:  I just hide them from him and when I feel that it's necessary to pull it
0 out, I'll pull it out, but he keeps one of them.  He keeps the one with the
0 B:  The balance?
0 A:  Yeah, uh, no, the, uh, credit line,
0 B:  Oh yes, uh-huh.
0 amount.
0 B:  So you know he can't spend too much.
0 A:  Yeah, you know, uh, I don't really exactly remember how much it is.  I
0 him to fiddle with.
0 B:  Yes, uh-huh.
0 A:  I have to think of something else, I'm,
0 B:  I was, I was, just, uh,
0 A:  I'm blank.
0 A:  Well six minutes, I've got a timer on my, uh, clock, on my phone.
0 A:  Oh, we bought this with credit too [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, did you [laughter].  See there you go.
0 A:  Well we found it with a clearance, uh, down in Memphis, I guess and, uh,
0 B:  Oh, your up in Memphis.
0 A:  No, I used to be, I'm in Texas.
0 B:  Oh, your in Texas, oh, okay, I was going to go goodness they really got,
0 uh, this out far. 
0 A:  Well I, I don't know, I don't know how far it goes.  Are you in Texas?
0 B:  Yeah, yeah I'm down in Houston.
0 A:  Oh, I'm in, uh, down here in Sherman,
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  or, Denison, rather.
0 B:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Well, oh, this has been just great, this was the first
0 A:  First phone call.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  This is my first one too.
0 B:  My husband did one last night and he just loved it.  He's been getting, he
0 A:  You know, we got to get back to credit cards.
0 all.  Yeah.  So, uh, but yeah, uh-huh, I think we couldn't make it without
0 them.
0 before, uh, I started taking the, uh, cards away, we maxed out a lot of, well
0 we had about six or seven and we maxed them out and, uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  that's got us in a little bit of trouble now.  That's why we, and we was
0 using one of them to pay off the bills on the others.  And that got that in
0 trouble there.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, but, uh, we, uh, we try to keep, uh, uh, tight controls ove-,
0 birthdays.
0 A:  Uh, uh, my hubby does not have, uh, too much control when it comes to
0 using that card, uh, I know, uh, uh, for quite a while we was using them to,
0 trouble and we got in to too expensive of a house, or apartment rather and,
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  uh, you know, he was only down here for one day and we just, everything
0 just piled up, wrecked the car and,
0 A:  you know, in order to do that, we had to, you know, we was paying the
0 B:  It gets rough.
0 A:  it got, it got real rough.
0 B:  That's hard.
0 A:  He just popped out that, uh, MasterCard and,
0 A:  Yeah, we got big cash advance and really, that's what's, uh, holding us
0 back now that's, 
0 B:  Yeah, it, uh, it but see it does come in handy, those, they do, they're
0 worth it, so.  Well, I, I think we've pretty much come to an end here.
0 @@A:  I'm trying to find out how long we're supposed talk.
0 B:  I think it was at least five minutes wasn't it.
1 without having to think about what I was saying and, 
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter]  Uh, what kind of books do you enjoy reading?
0 B:  Uh, haven't, have, I have a wide variety of, of hobbies, therefore, my, my
0 HIGHWAY,
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  which is, uh, very colorful, and, uh, not being a native of Texas, but
0 being here eleven years have a tendency to, uh, find out the, uh, about the
0 different areas of the co-, of the, of the state by reading it.
0 mother always gave me hers and I, I really enjoyed, you know, all the little
0 things that you find out about Texas.  
0 out and you can, uh, set up little trips and day trips and things.  It's
0 pretty, pretty neat. [talking] {background} Um, oh, I like photography,
0 um, magazines.  I don't take a subscription or anything like that.  Um, things,
0 oh, being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of, a lot of, uh, building
0 magazines and, and, and plant engineering magazines and, read up on different
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 engineering manual or something laying around the house and then I'll sit up
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  How about yourself?
0 A:  Well, um, I have an interest in art, so I, frequently purchase and read,
0 B:  Oh, that's great.
0 type books.  Uh, right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about, uh, the
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  That's fairly interesting.
0 B:  I bet that would be, rather interesting.  Uh, that's, uh, self
0 improvement, that's, that's alwa-, well, that's kind of a hobby but it is self
0 improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh.
0 A:  Yeah, I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.
0 How about you?
1 B:  Um, well I hate to, yes, I do [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 they give you books and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact I read was, AT
0 AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl ((Albrecht)).  It talks about, uh, who the customer
0 is and being customer oriented, uh, which falls in line with the T I culture
0 here at Texas Instruments.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 better be serving someone who is.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer
0 is and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.  Your my
0 customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing.
0 A:  Right.

0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Which all, you know, betters yourself.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, well, uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I
0 don't think of in terms of self improvement.
1 A:  I mean they are but I don't label it as such.
0 B:  [Laughter] Like what for example.
0 A:  Well, I don't know, um, I, uh, have attended some seminars that had some
0 to be successful and sort of talking to yourself.  You know ge-, getting your,
0 what you really want to do.
0 B:  Sure.
0 A:  Convincing you that you need to get on with it.
0 big, okay.
0 A:  Yes.
0 A:  Sure.
0 B:  Um, our supervisor, uh, subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY
0 SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW.
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  By a man, man named Doctor Bittel, B I T T E L {spells it out} and it's a
0 very layman's, uh, uh, approach towards managing different types of people.
1 how to manage engineers [laughter].
0 excellent fast reading and, uh, but as you say it's, it's sometimes it's
0 difficult to, to know if it's, you know, I think if somebody would say hey,
0 turned off to them.
0 B:  If he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a Stephen King book
0 King.  That's a little, little heavy for me.
0 interesting and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  it's always, they're always challenging to get through one of them.  I
0 have a hard time finishing books.
0 A:  Well I guess I also have been reading, uh, a lot of things on, uh, quality
0 improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot
0 at work.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  In quality, especially now days, uh, that's almost everything
0 that comes across the, the, the airways (( )).
0 but, uh,
0 B:  Exactly, exactly right.
0 A:  I think sometimes the word is a little over used but,
0 B:  Yeah, we, we have, I think we, we name drop it a little too much and, and
0 focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and, and all that kind of rolls
0 in together there,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  but, uh, that's just kind of part of it.
0 A:  Okay, well, any other comments.
0 @@B:  Uh, not that I can think of.  Um, I think I'm under my quota a little
0 bit.  I need to probably make a phone call or two [laughter].
0 A:  Well we just started, right.
0 B:  Uh, this is true.  I've enjoyed it.
0 A:  Well you too, and uh, good-bye.
0 B:  Have a good day.
0 A:  Good-bye.
0 A:  All right, I think we know what we're going to speak about.
0 A:  Uh, I tell you what, I'll start off.  How's that?  
0 B:  Okay, you go ahead.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends,
0 B:  In public places.
0 A:  I want to say Oklahoma, I saw something the other night about it.
0 B:  Um.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Which is obviously the death penalty.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 V -s and sixty dol-, sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a, on
0 a, on a life sentence, we should start hanging them and get it over with and
0 let's just screwing up the system.
0 B:  Yeah. Well, the sentences are so unbelievable.  I just saw on the news last
0 night, that they said the average time a sentenced murderer, you know, is in
0 A:  That's pathetic.
0 B:  and a burglar is like two months.
0 A:  That's pathetic.
0 B:  Because they just say there's either no room in the system, you know, in
0 the jails for them or, you know, it's just that, it seems like the automatic
0 sentences, if, if a judge has leeway, on what he's going to, you know,
0 sentence someone for between, you know, two months and fifty years and, you
0 know, what's his whim to decide it should be two months.
0 A:  This is true,
0 B:  You know, it's crazy.
0 A:  an, and the way the law reads, uh, if they sentence you to life in
0 eligible for parole.
0 B:  Well even if it's life, like you say, we end up spending sixty thousand
0 dollars a year to keep some, you know, joker in there for life.  We could
0 other things would be more useful than that.
0 A:  Exactly.
0 should, that should be it.
0 A:  A life for a life.
0 just major, major serial murders, it's not just like one instance, or
0 something, it's just, uh, horrifying, some of the murders that go on.
0 A:  The old Charles Manson case.  I mean the guy is really,
0 B:  Yeah, an, yeah, there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one
0 like that.
0 A:  just shouldn't be allowed to, to even, even live. 
0 A:  Uh, about the issue about sentencing by the judge.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  [Breathing] The, the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene, uh,
0 when there's a, my understanding, when there's uh, a verdict and it for
0 example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth, today, in eight to four and
0 bam, bam the guy got off.  Uh, he was, he was a veterinarian, and killed two,
0 a father and a son, okay.
0 B:  Right, yeah, I heard about that on the news.
0 A:  Uh, it kind of gets back to the second request, we've been asked to look
0 at, is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict.  In a situation
0 like that, I'd say no, let's just go like a regular vote.  Eight to four tells
0 there, with sixty percent of the people, uh, seventy percent of the people
0 said, hey,
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  they guys guilty.
0 B:  Rather than have to retrial the whole, whole thing and spend all the
0 money for people to, uh, you know, go back to court and all the lawyers and, I
0 doing that.
0 A:  Exactly.
0 B:  And the victims, you know, the family of these people that have been
0 ever get any resolution.
0 A:  Exactly, because it's not next day they have, the, start the trial, it's X
0 B:  Right, yeah, yeah.
0 A:  I think that, that if it's, if it's not a split decision, go with the
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  But as far as the sentencing by the judge, I would have to vote against
0 B:  Well if I, I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I believe from
0 the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really, you know, took
0 the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved, it could, you could have
0 the flip side, and have some judge that was paid off or, you know, had go-, a
0 good old boy network or for whatever reasons, you know, politics, just let all
0 kinds of people through so, he, he would have a heck, or she would have a heck
0 of a lot of power, you know, if used wrongly.  So at least the jury system
0 does something to prevent that, you know, or help it with it anyway.  I don't
0 know if it prevents it, but, seems like the jury system does have it's
0 advantages.  But I also, I've also heard on trials that sometimes they go
0 think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient, you
0 know, and I don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers, at
0 that point, they're really getting a select group.  It's not just random
0 people.
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  It almost should be the first twelve people that they, you know, have on
0 a list [laughter] are the ones that are on the jury and that's it.
0 A:  Yeah, I get back to Price's comment when he, uh, was found guilty he said
1 well he didn't have any blacks, uh, you know, from his neck of the woods.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Well give me a break, you know.
0 B:  He'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got
0 his peers or something, yeah.
0 A:  Exactly, yeah, yeah.  I mean you're, you're in Dallas so everybody, I can't
0 believe they can, uh, like in a murder situations, they look for juries who
0 don't know anything about the system, well or know anything about the, the
0 A:  you'd be, you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on,
0 or moving it to Lubbock,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  or somewhere, possibly is not the answer.
0 B:  Oh, they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it
0 practically.
0 A:  This is true, so true.
0 @@A:  Well this has been an interesting conversation.
0 B:  Well, really, this is, breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and
0 mopping floors, I mean, what can I say.
0 A:  So, you're at the house you're not at the plant.
0 B:  No, I'm at home with two little ki-, preschoolers.  My husband works for T

0 the laundry room [laughter].
0 A:  Oh goodness, well, I'll let you get,
0 B:  Okay, thanks a lot. Bye-bye.
0 lax dress policy at work and it varies like every day.  I mean from jeans one
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  It's pretty bad, but it's true, you know, [talking] {kids in background}
0 they tend to try to be, you know, real lax and supposedly the policy is like,
0 you know, we, you know, we, hire these wonderful creative people and we don't
0 want to ((smush)) their creativity, you know.  We want to go ahead and let
0 them do what ever they want.  And, you know, you really will see people in in
0 jeans one day and business suits the next.
0 B:  Well, I'm kind of that way too.  I work in the legal department and where
0 we are now, what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day, it
0 always seems like I'm doing that and I can't see getting dressed up and
0 wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry, you know, boxes of documents
0 around, so, if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and
0 down.  But if we're going to have a meeting, where we're having the attorneys
0 normally dress up.  Yeah, and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff.
0 A:  Yeah, you know, we're kind of that way too.  I try to, I'm the same way you
0 work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and, you know, if I know that they're going to be there, you know, you, I
0 try to really watch it and like you say, you know, really dress up and if I
0 know, the last couple of months the same way you are, you know,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 dig through boxes in a dress.
0 B:  [Laughter] That's right, that's right.
0 A:  It is and so,
0 the first year or so, we were sent out to our record retention facility to
0 A:  Uh.
0 B:  and at that point, it, the warehouse was over across the road and it
0 wasn't air conditioned, and, it, we were there like in the middle of the
0 summer, it's unair-conditioned, it was dusty and dirty, uh, there was like a
0 fan at the very end of the row and that was it.  And so, we didn't really know
0 we weren't supposed to, we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate
0 to your job,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  we wore shorts.  We didn't know that was a big no, no.
0 A:  Oh no.
0 area where record retention is, there's only a few people that work there, and
0 supervisor's supervisor, and it went up all the way to the head of facilities,
0 A:  Oh no [/talking] {kids in background}.
0 B:  complaining that we were wearing shorts.  He didn't at, at least say to
0 us, did you know you're not supposed to do that.  That could have alleviated a
0 big problem.  We ended up getting called out on it.
1 A:  Oh, how awful.  It sounds like Mr. Power Hungry.
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah.
0 A:  You know, just yesterday, though, I saw a girl in the ((spine)) out here at
0 Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts.
0 A:  And I don't care, you can call them split skirts and you can call them
0 A:  I don't care what else you call them, you know, if they're below the knee,
0 okay, maybe you can call them split skirts.  If they're above the knee they
1 turn into shorts, you know.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  And these weren't even really full ones.  I mean they had a problem out
0 here with it last summer, wearing these shorts that were, you know, the real
0 wide full ones, you know, and becau-, these weren't even those.  These were
0 like pretty short, black, and they were very dressy, the were black velvet
0 shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very, very
0 nice.
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  But, you don't wear shorts to work.  You know, I mean, (( )) as far as I'm
0 always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime.
0 A:  You know, if they just, you know, the management doesn't ever seem to want
0 line.  This is shorts, you know.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And, and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that, you know, 
0 B:  Um.
0 have a pair of those at home too.  It sure would be cool and comfortable to
0 B:  Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend
0 because they want to use the TexTeller machine.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And they have said no [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah and then during the week you see these women, in the you know, just
0 because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts
0 hose on, but still, it's, they're shorts, I don't care what you say, they're
1 shorts.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Well I think T I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything, anyway,
0 you know, uh.
0 B:  I know, I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code, I had a
0 friend,
0 A:  Oh do they really?
0 B:  Oh definitely.  I had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they
0 spell it out.  For men it's particular suits, uh, the pin stripe, and the
0 A:  Oh, my God.
0 B:  Oh, it is definitely lined out.  Women are not allowed to wear slacks,
0 you wear coordinated suits.
0 A:  I coul-, I couldn't afford to work there.
0 spelled out.
0 A:  Oh, no.
0 B:  When I was looking at her materials when she first started, you know, she
0 had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 shirts you may wear, or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the
0 B:  Yeah, and E D S is very particular about this, hair cuts, 
0 A:  Wow.
0 B:  I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair,
0 no beards, you know, and just really detailed.
0 A:  I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in.  I mean, I
0 see, I, I am more, I don't know about anybody else, and a lot of bosses may
1 say I'm nuts, but I am more productive when I'm in pants.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  I, I am.  I work faster, I get things done faster, than when I'm in a dress
0 and heels, you know, I, and it's weird but I, it's I do, I can, I can get so
0 because we had, uh, another person coming from Washington, our outside
0 counsel.  And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse but she
0 really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  And she came with skirts, just like she'd be going into the office. 
0 B:  And we'd try, we'd try to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything.
0 We're, we're out here in the warehouse, you know, you, you got your skid of,
0 you know, that wooden pallet of boxes.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and you're going to have un-, unload you skid look at the documents in
0 the, in the boxes and then repack your skid.  And she [laughter],
0 B:  And she was so, she was so hot and miserable, you know, in the skirt.
0 A:  Oh yuck.
0 B:  She finally tried to go buy, you know, a pair of pants but, you know, I
0 mean it was just completely miserable for her.
1 A:  Yeah, that's terrible, that's terrible gosh.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 a pair of jeans, you know.  But I'll go in in pants.  I mean today I had on a
0 pair of, you know, navy blue dress slacks and, and, uh, like a peach colored
0 top and, you know, not cruddy, but not a dress either.  And sometimes I wonder
0 if stuff like that would, will hold you back, you know, if you don't dress in,
0 you know, your dress for success business suits everyday if, you know, if
0 upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on, but, you
0 and they're in jeans, so, you know.
0 B:  Some of our people in the legal department, we have, um, assistants to the

0 B:  And then there's another one who's, who's a little younger and a little
0 know, a shirt,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and
0 then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt.
0 So that's just,
1 A:  Isn't that funny.
0 B:  [Laughter] With the, you know, the little suspenders or something on so.  
0 it's mainly who they're going to meet with, or they're meeting with people
0 that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  If there just going to be meeting with T I -ers like to talk about a
0 patent kind of thing and the, they're engineers that they're talking too, they
0 dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they're usually casual.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  It really is, because your making, you know, if when they're meeting with
0 the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down, if they come in, in,
0 you know, a six hundred dollar three piece suit, it's going to make the people
0 they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable, you know, or it would me, you

0 B:  And, I know the reason why this is, why the, uh, this is being gathered and
0 being a speaker.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  We haven't talked much about the weather [laughter].
0 B:  I know that's what we're supposed to do.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, really it, [static] uh, the letter just says, um, let's
0 see, I can't, I was looking at it, I was trying to find out speedy short cuts,
0 and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time, just to go ahead
0 and enjoy the conversation, and, and, end it when needed. So.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  In environmental engineering, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, you know,
0 environm-, the work place environment or,
0 A:  Uh, well, it's actually, um, waste water.
0 B:  Oh, I see.
0 A:  Taking, taking care of uh, I'm actually in the air division, and we
0 monitor, um, [static] anything that comes out of a stack, or out of a
0 building, or, um, we do have customers that, um, their concerns are in the
0 work place and we take care of that, but (( )),
0 A:  within our department.  We take care of everything.  Waste water, uh,
0 solid waste, and recycling, and, and air and [sigh],
0 B:  Well, I had my, the, the call last evening was supposed to be about,
0 A:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 B:  in the community.  The call I received, and so, I had, uh, I had
0 thought a little bit about it, um,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  before hand.
0 who is a planner.
0 A:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 and so forth,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And, one of the, uh, he has inputs, or gets inputs from, uh, an
0 environmental engineer. (( )).
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, we actually, our division is corporate wide, and we take
0 care of just the Dallas area.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Of course we have several plants here, but, um, we do air modeling also.
0 B:  Oh, I see.
0 A:  And, and, yeah, I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the
0 Dallas area.  What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this
0 information, you know, temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and, uh, we
0 have a huge chemical data base.
0 B:  Well, that's interesting.
0 A:  And, uh, our, [static] our chemical data base, so that we know every
0 chemical on site and, and, um, it's concentration, and if, if anything ever
0 happened, God forbid, you know, a building explosion or something tha-, we'd
0 @B:  Okay.
0 A:  And, um, do you like classic rock, or modern rock, or which kind?
0 B:  Oh, I guess the stuff [baby_crying] that was done more in the seventies,
0 A:  No, not a seventies baby.
0 is that kind of music [laughter], I mean,
0 A:  Is it disco, or is it like,
0 A:  [Laughter] but,
0 B:  No, more like, uh, rock, um, you know, like Led Zepplin type [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, okay.  So, so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin.
0 A:  Yeah, that's cool.
0 B:  Right.
0 				      
0 A:  And, how about the Rolling Stones?
0 B:  Oh, sure, sure I went to their concert last year when they were here.
0 A:  Oh, that's when, that's when they took, toured. How about, um, Pink Floyd?
0 A:  Okay.  So, so then we got, we got some same things because,  
0 B:  Okay, well, I just didn't know that much about music and I wasn't sure what
0 A:  No, it's very hard because, see, well, I mean, in the whole spectrum I'd
0 rather listen, you know, I listen to heavy metal or classic rock.
0 B:  What, what kind of heavy metal are we talking about?  What,
0 B:  Okay, like, give me some examples.
0 A:  Like, for example, let's see, uh, Bad Company, what,
0 B:  Oh, well, Bad Cam-, Company's not bad, that's not,
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, A C D C [laughter].
0 A:  Why, have you heard of them?
0 B:  Yes [laughter].
0 A:  Okay.  And, stuff like that.  That's, that's,
0 B:  Well, okay.
0 A:  that's not really hard rock.
0 B:  Okay, I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal.
0 Cinderella, you know.
0 A:  Well, Cinderella is, is hard rock, heavy metal.
0 B:  Well, see, I don't really care for Cinderella [laughter].  But, I like A C
0 D C's okay.
0 A:  But, see, for example, they have, see what, but other bands consider it
0 like really hard rock.  It's like brash metal, which all they do is like, they
0 have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar, and the guitar is set like,
0 really low,
0 B:  Yeah.  No, I don't really care for that too much, I guess.
0 A:  and, what happens is like, oh, everybody gets like totally into the music
0 and then they start dancing around,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and they just bump into each other,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and, then, you knock people down, and what you do is, you also try to get
1 up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.
0 B:  [Laughter] Is that the kind of music that you like?
0 A:  No, I don't like that music.
0 A:  But, that's, that's what they do.  That's, that's what some people call
0 like really heavy metal.
0 A:  And, see, the difference, I guess, between hard rock and heavy metal is
0 that the lyrics also.  Like really, like heavy metal, wo-, is considered, like
0 the words heavy metal and, like, you always thought about, like, suicide.  And
0 killing people and stuff like that.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And, just hard rock has, they, they don't talk about that, they just talk
0 about, like, life in general.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  Like, Queen's Reich, if you ever heard of them.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Que-, you, you're talking Queen, is that what you said?
0 A:  Okay, well, no.  I said Queen's Reich, but,
0 B:  Oh, oh, oh, okay,
0 A:  but, oh, but you got to like Queen also.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  So because,
0 B:  Well sure, because Queen was real popular when I was growing up.
0 have a, no let's see, the one that they have the, the whole opera singing in
0 the background.
0 B:  Oh!  Um, uh,
0 B:  Right, right, yeah, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, that, that was great.  I heard that the other day on the radio and I
1 pumped it up.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Because, I mean, I just love that song.
0 A:  Yeah, but they had, that, that whole record was pretty good.  But then,
0 they started going downhill like everybody else.
0 B:  Well, that's true.  They came up with some pretty weird stuff after 
0 that.
0 A:  Yeah, they're, they're still around, they've got a ne-, new C D out, but I,
0 I wouldn't buy it.  Because see, what happens is, the old, see whe-, I like, I
0 like the old Rolling Stones.  I don't like the new stuff.
0 B:  Of the Stones?
0 B:  Yeah.  I agree.  That's the ne-, the older stuff is the best of it.  The,
0 the new stuff's kind of more like, today's rock and roll, which I,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  don't really care for today's rock and roll too much.
0 A:  Well, for example, I used to like old Phil Collins.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  An old, Genesis?
0 B:  Yes, definitely.  I agree.
0 A:  And, and, then what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make
0 Invisible Touch, with, uh, Genesis and that really, like now, I hate Phil
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  Because, I look at him and I say, you know, you were singing at this time,
0 and with these people, and you were great, and now you're singing all this
0 stuff that, doesn't matter what you, what you sing or what you record, it's
0 still going to be a number one hit.  And so, that's, that's what gets me mad.
0 A:  But, did, did you go see that new Doors movie?
0 A:  Yeah.  I saw it when it opened.
0 B:  Was it really good?
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, it, it's, you know, it's like, I was watching Siskel and
0 Ebert,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  you know, like those guys that criticize movies?
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  They said the music's great, it took me back to the sixties, and stuff like
0 that.
0 A:  And then, one of them said, well, everything is great, but I'm going to
0 give it thumbs down.  And they go, but why?  Because it's like, the end is,
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  But it, but it's like the movie is so well made, and the music that goes
0 with it just picks you up, see, I was never, I was born in nineteen hundred
0 sixty-nine.
0 B:  Oh, okay.  
0 A:  So, I mean, so for me,
0 B:  So, you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then.
0 got a lot to say.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  I, I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too.  You know,
0 I was like,
0 don't like disco, I've never liked disco.
1 B:  [Laughter]  Well, that's true [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 to late seventies, like between seventy-five and,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  Did, did you go to college?
0 B:  Well, no.  I'm going right now [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, that's cool.
0 B:  But uh, no I didn't go then.  But see, I graduated high school in
0 seventy-eight,
0 A:  Okay.
0 heavy, you know, and real, um,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  So, so that's what I mean, disco wasn't really my time.
0 A:  Well, they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in, in
0 progression, ever in history.  So,
0 B:  About music?
0 A:  No, about everything.
0 B:  Oh.  Okay.
0 during the sixties, the seventies I don't know what they're called, you know,
0 the, or, you know, like the technology years,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  because of all the computers and stuff.  But the seventies got nothing.
0 I mean, nobody cared to name it [laughter].
0 B:  That's kind of funny [laughter].
0 A:  So.
0 they're calling them,
0 A:  Yeah, I know.
1 B:  are gone.
0 A:  [Laughter] Can you imagine the, like a big picture of John Travolta, ta-da,
0 what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER?  Him just standing there.
0 B:  Yeah, right.
0 A:  Yeah, that's a good example to look for in history.  Well, from now on
0 we're going to go from the, from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first
0 step on the moon, to nineteen eighties.  Okay, what happened in the middle?
0 Don't worry, don't worry, you're not, you're not missing anything, you know,
1 so,
0 B:  [Laughter] That's true.  Well, except for Vietnam.
0 A:  Yeah, really.  And, that's, 
0 B:  You know with,
0 A:  that's why I guess, everybody, yeah, it's like they don't want to talk
0 about that, so they just, don't name it.  I mean, it was, it was, I guess it
0 was pretty bad times.
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, that's very true [laughter].  But,
0 A:  Oh, well, let's see, yeah, okay, we've been talking for seven minutes, so,
0 B:  Oh, good.  I haven't even been keeping track.
0 @@A:  Okay, all right, so um, I'm going to leave you alone.  Uh what, what are
0 you doing?  Do you have a family?
0 B:  Uh, yeah. 
0 A:  Okay.
0 B:  We're kind of, I was kind of in the middle of supper, but it's not a big
0 deal,
0 A:  Oh, I'm sorry.
0 to call me last night but I didn't have my number yet, I just got it today.
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  And so, you know, it's okay.  I, I told them I'd be available during this
0 time, so,
0 A:  Okay.  All right.
0 B:  anyway.
0 B:  Okay, thanks.
0 A:  #that bad.  Bye, bye.#
0 A:  Have you all been able to do much as a family these days?
0 B:  Pardon me.
0 A:  Have you all been able to do much as, uh, as a full family these days, all
0 of you.
0 B:  Oh, yes, we've, uh, been, um, we've gone other, you know, all kinds of
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  we take the kids to the park, and, uh, you know, [baby_crying] whenever
0 we, he, my husband has time off or something, we take them to the zoo, or we,
0 you know, we do everything we can possibly as a family.
0 A:  Do you work outside the home?
0 B:  No, I don't.
0 A:  Yeah, I don't either, it makes it a little bit easier, I think, that way.
0 with the kids, you know, he'll, he'll take them out just to be with them.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  So he, they can have time with him an.
0 A:  So you have a break too.
0 B:  Right, so and we, uh, we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home,
0 you know, we have, we try to spend like Monday nights, we call it family home
0 evening,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and, have our kids, uh, you know, have little lessons with them, and, you
0 know, just see, count, see how things are going in our family and, you know,
0 teach them about their grandparents or something like that.  Bring out
0 pictures of them so they get to know them and, we just do all kinds of fun
0 things like that an.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  you know, the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures.  And,
0 A:  Right, and phone calls that's about, [laughter] about it.
0 B:  Yeah, right and, uh, you know, they, we, you know, we go to the park or we
0 go in the backyard and sit down an,
0 A:  That's wha-, yeah, that's what we mostly do, pretty simple things. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 months.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  She, she's really getting to the age where she's playing,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and likes to go places.
0 B:  Yeah, and with, you know, me being at home and just having the one income,
0 you know, you don't have, this lot of extra money to, to do a lot of, you
0 know, extra things.
0 A:  That's right.
0 it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or,
0 they, they think that's a lot of fun.  So we just, we try to spend as much
0 something, 
0 A: Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, that's true.
0 B:  Yeah, so.
0 B:  Yes, yes, that's what.
0 weeks ago and, uh, [throat_clearing].
0 B:  Uh-huh, the kids thought that was wonderful.
0 We've only been in, I think it's Science Place Two.
0 B:  I, is, I'm not sure which one we went into, it was about a year or so ago,
0 when we went.
0 A:  The one we went in had, uh, the thing that sticks out most in my mind is
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah they had a lot of fun in there and, uh, there's, uh, there's
0 A:  Where's that.
0 B:  That's on Plano Road, uh, it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road,
0 it's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road [children_talking].  
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  And that's a lot of fun.  
0 lot of fun, too.
0 A:  Oh, that does sound like fun. It's a little bit of a ways,
0 wonderful just to go to McDonalds, you know, they don't go for the food they
0 B:  There's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and it's a indoor fun park and it has a bunch of different rides for
0 kids.
0 A:  That's sounds fun too.
0 A:  And, and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting,
0 A:  [Throat_clearing]  That sounds fun I think maybe we'll try to do that.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah and the one in Mesquite is, uh, Scyene exit.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And it's, it's, uh, the kids just had a wonderful time there, they, you
0 know, you just pay that admission, and then all the, the, the rides are free.
0 You know, of course, they have all the little video games and, you know, those
0 little quarter rides, you know, to, and stuff like that but,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  they thought that was lot of fun.  You can have birthday parties there
0 an, I think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there's more for
0 them to do.
0 B:  Yeah, right.
0 A:  That does sound like fun.  Well I've gotten some good ideas from you
0 B:  Yeah.  I, we try to do a lot of things as a family and, you know,
0 A:  Definitely.  Well, I think, I don't know if we've done five minutes but I'm
0 sure that will be good.
0 B:  Yeah, that will be good, yeah.
0 A:  It was good talking to you.
0 B:  #Well it was good talking to you.#
0 A:  #I really appreciate your suggestions.#
0 Hewlett-Packard.
0 A:  Oh really.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 some interesting times getting used to it, um, used to the United States, the,
0 the language was a little bit different, although he did speak English.  It
0 was just some of the phr-,
0 A:  Yeah, have you ever been there?
0 B:  Excuse me.
0 A:  Have you ever been there?
0 B:  I've never been there, my dad used to work for DuPont and they built a
0 A: Really.
0 A:  No, I've never been there either.  I've not known but just a few people
0 from there. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 training, actually who was from there.
0 B:  Uh-huh, okay.  Uh, my dad flew down there for about a year.  He was down
0 there about once a month, one week per month.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, uh, I wanted to move there.  It sounded like, uh, a neat place to
0 live, an island in the sun, you know.
0 A:  Oh, yeah. [laughter] It always sounds more,
0 B:  And, uh, it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn't
0 want to go, because she didn't play golf or tennis and [laughter] [breathing]
0 there wasn't really a job for her there.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Ever-, e-, because I spent five years in Europe,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and everybody goes, oh, you're so lucky and I'm like, well yeah, sort of,
0 you know,
0 A:  it's, but, having lived there it's not, it's not anything like you
0 picture it, 
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  you know, it's not, it's like I still have the fantasies about Hawaii,
0 and all that stuff but,
0 thing to me, oh, it must have been great.
0 A:  And your just like, yeah well, sort of, right [laughter]. 
0 B:  I go, oh, it was just a place to live, yeah, I was,
0 they, should they become a state?
0 B:  I, I think the status quo seems to be working.  I don't think, um, from
0 talking to Jerry, my friend that lived there, 
0 B:  that they don't seem, um, upset about it or anything and I think it would
0 upset more people if they tried to change it.
0 A:  Really.  I, I think, I'm not opposed to it but when its, when the time is
0 B:  Yeah,  I don't know fifty-one stars on this flag wouldn't look too
1 good [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] Where are they going to put the other one.
0 B:  Yeah, if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty-two might
0 be able to, uh, be arranged better, I don't know.
0 A:  Well, where, where are we going to get another state.
1 B:  Yeah, I don't know, cut California in half or something.
0 A:  [Laughter] Or Texas.  No that's not a good idea.
0 B:  But, um, I know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because
0 they'll build plants down there because they don't have to pay taxes on the
0 stuff.
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  Um, and they make, I guess it's no income tax there, or fed-, no federal
0 A:  Oh yeah, because it's just a territory.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Or, is that what it's called, a territory?
0 B:  Um, yeah I think it's a territory. 
0 A:  Okay.
0 B:  That makes sense.  I mean there's, uh, lots of tiny islands in the South
0 Pacific that are territories like that they could make states like, Guam or,
0 uh,
0 A:  Is that a U S territory though?
0 A:  That would be kind of bizarre. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  That's kind of far.
0 A:  Well that's true, but there is not a whole lot between here and there.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Where you, you start dealing with Guam, it's like, you know, flying over
0 all these other places to get there.
0 B:  Yeah, it's definitely a way out of the way, where Pu-, where as,
0 A:  My dad was stationed in Guam during the World War Two, though.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Which, I don't know.
0 A:  Of course you could annex Cuba, but they wouldn't like that a bit
1 [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter]  No, I don't think they would.
0 A:  I don't think they'd go for that.
0 B:  Yeah, but actually, I knew another guy from Puerto Rico that I went to
0 school with and he was coming, he came to, America to, to go to school. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh, yeah, he thinks,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  I don't know if that's, uh, if that's true about all Puerto Ricans or not,
0 but the ones I met have been pretty, pretty funny.
0 B:  Yeah, I don't, I didn't hear any major complaints about it.  Um, I
0 state now or you're your own country, or whatever.
0 A:  Yeah, exactly.
0 B:  But, um, let them decide.
0 A:  Really.  That's why I said, you know, when it, when, when their time is
0 right, when they're ready for it, you know, that it will come about.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, I think that makes the most sense.
0 A:  Okay, well Rick, it's been good talking to you.
0 @@B:  Okay, ha-, have we been on for a long enough time?
0 B:  Okay, yeah, this is, this is actually the first time I've, I've had
0 someone call me so --
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  -- but, uh, it went fine.
0 A:  #Okay, bye-bye.#
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Central America, have you ever lived in Central America.
0 A:  I wasn't in Central America but, uh, talking about Latin America, I kind
0 of, I consider Latin America to include Central and South America and I did
0 live in, uh, ((San Polo)) Brazil for four years.
0 B:  Do you, do you think that, that we should have given up the Panama Canal?
0 A:  Uh, realistically, I, yes, I don't see the, the Panama Canal that hasn't
0 had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not, not really big
0 enough to, uh, accommodate the, the shipping that it once did and, uh, maybe
0 certainly justified in, uh, our actions dealing with, uh, Noriega in this ...
0 B:  Well, there are those that, that, that think that, that, that the Panama
0 Canal has some considerable strategic importance, particularly for the
0 as, uh, as a civil engineer they, they, they offered him a commission as a
0 captain if he would, uh, go in and, and, uh, help with the defenses of the
0 Panama Canal.  He had worked for United Fruit Company there,
0 B:   and they, uh, they, in fact, they had, this was in the, the late
0 don't realize how small the canal is.  Have you ever been there? 
0 A:  No, I haven't.
0 B:  It's, it's really, I, I haven't been there, I've been to, been to Salvador
0 quite small and, and realistically could be sabotaged quite, quite easily.
0 approach and, and, and do we, do we support the Sandinistas or, or do we
0 support, uh, you know, when they thought, uh, they thought that Nicaragua, if
0 you gave them a free election, they would vote for the, Will you, uh, did
0 you ever studied the, the political makeup there, in, in, in Nicaragua.
0 on the region, but, uh, certainly, uh, I, it, it gets, it ge-, there, your,
0 you've got this, this toss up betw-, or not, not so much a toss up but a, a
0 dilemma when, when you want a country to have its, its, um, own, uh, dominion,
0 or its free rein over its, its own people.  And then on the other hand, uh,
0 the, uh, the government in power that under what seem, what seems to be
0 support, um, starts making overtures to the Soviet Union.  And, and into what
0 uh, United States is, believes in democracy and, and self determination, where
0 a-, but that on the other hand we believe in self preservation and, uh, agree
0 infl-, Soviet influence in, in what's considered to be the United States
0 sphere of the world which is not only, you, we used to see spheres but now
0 we're in a situation where the United States is, looks like we're it now.
0 B:  Well the interesting part about it is that, if, realistically it was
0 economic.  I don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama
0 Canal but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua, uh, and, uh, there
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and, um, from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more
0 difficult to have built it in Nicaragua, but the, the United States, uh, had
0 some, and I've forgotten what the political influence was but there were
0 economic ties then.  The issue of, of if, if it's in the economic interest of
0 the United States, uh, do we go in and, and prevail and, and, uh, in other
0 words do we make the world safe for democracy,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  but if there's no economic benefit, and I think particularly if you're,
0 if you're looking at the, at the, at the peasant, uh, whether he's in Central
0 America, regardless of where he is, is his life, is his life better off under
0 communism or, or uh, or Democratic government.  You look at Salvador where
0 the,
0 they'll mostly leave him alone, uh, and I think that's the difficulty they,
0 that, that we have that, uh, it, it reality doesn't make, uh, doesn't make any
0 difference if he has no income.  And apparently even some of our alleged, uh,
0 Central American leaders that, uh, are mostly democratic have done some pretty
0 terrible things, so it's, uh,
0 A:  Yeah, well, yo-, in looking, bu-, if you look at the region in, in, uh, to
0 their detriment they came from, uh, this, uh, hundreds of years of Spanish
0 their public for their own, their own good.  I mean, if you go back to the
0 kings and, and the, the conquistadors coming in and, and the hor-, incredibly
0 they make the things that Custer did look like, uh, like trivial.  And, uh,
0 you get, 
0 B:  It is, it is interesting, that, that, you know we, we look at the
0 exploitation and, and, and then we accuse some other people of exploiting them
0 and, and Americans have, uh, have a pretty good reputation of exploiting, you
0 know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and, and took it.
0 A:  Oh, absolutely and, you know we set up ...
0 B:  and we stole it fair and square, I think is, uh,
0 A:  An, I mean, Ted, Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation, speak softly
0 and carry a big stick for, uh, for nothing and, uh,
0 B:  Well what's going to be interesting is to the see what the economic impact
0 of, of, uh, of the, the region, uh, you know, at the moment, it, the
0 tremendous drug traffic through there, but, uh,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  the idea of, of, uh, what's the, what's America's role there and it, it,
0 uh, with, with other things going on, it, it seems to have lessened, but
0 A:  The only, the only thing I see about Cuba though, is, uh, after Fidel
0 Castro dies, I don't think they'll be a communist power anymore.  I, I can't
0 see communism in that country carrying on past him.
0 B:  Well, when you take a, a situation where I think in particular in Salvador
0 where there is a significant under class [cough], excuse me, and that, uh, you
0 know, having a, a lot of difficulty, uh, surviving, uh, the question is would
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  and I wouldn't, don't know that I would advocate communism but, uh, the
0 question is can, uh, can you, can, uh, can a democracy, uh, afford the, it's
0 B:  that's essentially an underclass and when you get enough of them, uh, you
0 know communism would feed them all.
0 A:  Ye-, well, I, I don't know if maybe communism is the right, the right word
0 for it but what we would, there would have to be some kind of, there, there
0 kind of socialistic, uh, organization or socialistic set up to, to deal with
0 know, if he, if he can raise enough, uh, coffee and bananas to, uh, where he's
0 got something to protect, other, you know, 
0 A:  Right, right.
0 B:  whether he can export or at least, uh, set up trade and all then
0 democracy of a considerable interest.
0 A:  But cocoa leaves sell real well right now, it seems, yeah.
0 A:  Absolutely.  I don't, it's going to be hard to, um, we, if you, you, that,
0 that's where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region
0 mean.
0 know, a thousand dollars a day to, to grow something in your backyard, would
0 you do it.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Well not that we could be bought, but, uh,
0 A:   I've got to watch what I say here, I never know when the D I A may
0 be, uh, listening on my phone [laughter].
0 B:  Well of course, everything we're saying is being recorded and ...
0 A:  Right, 
0 B:  Of course, of course.
0 B:  Particularly, if you're hungry. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, you, it's not, it's not just a matter of, uh, of having an
0 themselves their wife and their family and, and you, there's a certain degree
0 of honor in being able to feed your family and there's dishonor in not being
0 able to do it and ...
0 B:  Uh, starving to death is not a, not a whole lot of fun either and, that,
0 uh, and, and, you know,
0 A:  No, no.
0 B:  when somebody comes in an offers, I think that's one of the real
0 the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  In reality, I think, what they were doing is basically going in and
0 I'm, I'm not sure the Catholic church is, is, is particularly political but,
0 you know, if ...
0 never met anybody who likes it.  Do you by any chance?
0 B:  Oh, yes.
0 A:  You do!
0 A:  Well, wouldn't you know [laughter].
0 B:  As a matter of fact, I prefer public television.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, uh, I have, particularly enjoy the English comedies,
0 A:  Yeah,
0 A:  And, the plots are more, um, challenging, you know, than the sitcoms of
0 regular T V.
0 B:  Well, unfortunately for us at least here in the United States, we, the
0 only access we have to that of course is public television.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  I'm, I'm not a great television watcher in any respect but, uh, the
0 watching, what I do watch is, uh, usually news and whatever is on public
0 B:  in that regard.
0 B:  No [sigh],
0 A:  Oh, that was a scream.
0 B:  no, no as a matter of fact, uh, Turner Broadcasting,
0 A:  Uh-huh,
0 B:  has been uh, broadcasting all of the James Bond movies, 
0 B:  every night this week, so I have concentrated on watching James Bond
1 movies,
0 A:  I used to like him too, he was my hero.  In fact, I like Sean Connery to
0 B:  and, it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  No, no that's true.  I was just thinking that today, he did,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  well, in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate,
0 A:  Yeah,
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, he does.
0 B:  Whereas, uh, Sean Connery has maintained the, uh, how would you, uh, ruddy
0 look, but uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah.  I liked his accent too.
0 A:  And, he can even be in movies that are not, uh, uh, sexually oriented, and
0 he still comes off great.
0 B:  Well, you know he was, when was it, last year or year before last, he was
0 voted the sexiest actor in movies,
0 A:  He is.
0 B:  or something.
0 B:  [Laughter] I mean the man is sixty-two years old.
0 A:  I don't care [laughter].
0 B:  But, uh, but otherwise you know we, uh, with P B S and so forth.  And I,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  I particularly enjoy, I don't know whether you've had a chance to watch
0 it on P B S but uh, the series, uh, YES MINISTER?
0 A:  Oh, what's that about?
0 B:  That was about a, the Interior Minister, it was a comedy, 
0 B:  the Interior Minister of, in England,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  with the permanent secretary,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  and bureaucracy and all that.
0 A:  Right, I, I've seen it several times.  It's a scream, but I have to go to
1 bed, I have to get up and, and work the next morning.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  I wish they'd put those, that's why I say, did you stay up late to watch
0 this RED DWARF.  It came on after DOCTOR WHO,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  on Saturday nights, here at least.  And it should, of course I li- really
0 it was, I don't think they should show it during prime time, but still,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  it was funny.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and, uh, quite a bit.  I read about two or three novels a week,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  in addition to all the technical stuff.  What, what do you do?  What kind
0 of work do you do?
0 A:  No, uh, I have a friend who works for T I and I work for a tire service,
0 A:  here in, I'm from Dallas.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well the last two people who have called, both worked for T I and
0 I just wondered.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, it could be T I -ers, I think, probably are participating more
0 A:  Yeah, really.  Do you work for T I?
0 B:  No, no, I work for G T E. 
0 A:  Really?
0 A:  How did you hear, oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this
0 though, are we?
1 B:  I guess not.  
0 B:  How did I hear about it?  Well I work, you know, they are gathering a data
0 base for voice processing.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  So I, I know the people at T I who are doing this and I heard about it, so
0 I called them and asked if I could participate.  And, uh, 
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  so I sent in the forms, et cetera and so forth.
0 A:  Right.
0 ision shows [laughter].e you caught any of this
0 series on the Bible?
0 A:  I've heard that it's really against the, well I mean that it's coming out
0 with the idea that the Bible's not true.
0 B:  Well, no.  That's, uh, you could interpret it that way.  
0 B:  Uh, I, I think what they are trying to say, is that there is a great deal
0 of historical truth, but the interpretation that actually got into the writing
0 of the Bible itself is probably [sigh] uh, after the what, uh, was is it the
0 that so much was lost in the translation, particularly since most of the
0 translations were in Greek.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Right.
0 for love of your wife, one word for, you know, uh, love of your father, and
0 that sort of thing.  So, in, as to those types of interpretations, uh, really
0 made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at.
0 histories that are, were developed around that time, that are available.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  To deny that, at least the majority of it is true.  So, you know, it
0 depends on how you look at it.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  I guess if you're looking for that, you're,
0 A:  that, uh,   
0 B:  Well, you can interpret that the, what the T V show, in the same way that
0 you can interpret the Bible.
0 B:  So, 
0 A:  Really.
0 B:  But, uh, as, as far as that goes, I, we at least agree on what we enjoy.  
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Surely we've made it.
0 B:  I think so too.  Let's just, it's been very pleasant talking to you,
0 A:  It was very nice talking to you.
0 B:  and have a good evening.
0 B:  Good night!
0 B:  I was a resident, although very young of the sta-, of what is now the state
0 of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and
0 question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.  Uh, I know
0 been very positive, uh, and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a,
0 the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto
0 Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or, or let it go, one or
0 the other.  What is your situation?
0 A:  Well, I'm, I guess I don't have su-, such close experience with, with,
0 um, an area becoming a state as you do.  Um, my concern is the economy because
0 as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low sta-, uh, standard of living or
0 at least, um, annual average income.  Um, part of this I suppose is justified
0 in, in that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing
0 that some of the more northern territories need.  However, in that case, I
0 guess I would favor status quo.  I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it
0 very, very interesting.  I did Peace Corps training there.
0 B:  Oh that's very interesting.
0 A:  And so, um, you know, I saw it, also as a young student and, and it was
0 very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California  and so
0 and the people seemed very friendly and, and nice.  I have, actually, I work
0 with, uh, a girl from Puerto Rico and, I guess I have never thought to ask her
0 what she favors, um.
0 B:  Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state
0 would that put even more pressures on, on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U.
0 S. in terms of aid or, 
0 A:  Well probably more on, in terms of the U. S.  Um, you know, I'm, I'm not
0 quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing.  I've live abro-,
0 abroad most of my life, so, I guess I, I've been very cut off.  I lived
0 actually in Lebanon, so, I was very cut off from the, the press as I, you
0 know, and be, was becoming an adult.  So, I don't know how the U. S. would
0 cope with, uh, a new state that is so very, very poor.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Um, I guess, you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the
0 inner cities of like New York and, and how much aid it needs.  I suppose the
0 whole country, or the whole, um, new state would require such aid.
0 B:  I guess, um, we're assuming that, that Puerto Rico would be per capita
0 significantly more poor perhaps than, than say Mississippi or, 
0 A:  I think so.
0 B:  Okay, that's something that, that I guess I have not much of an image of
0 other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large
0 numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a ((perjuritive)) sense but in
0 a, in a carefree sense, I guess.  Although I'm aware of the political problems
0 and unrest, and, and also difficulties they have.  Um, I don't know whether
0 I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have
0 now.  But of course if their economy is weak the-, there is not much of a base
0 on which to tax.  I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as
0 being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so
0 to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be.  How
0 territory, but, um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as
0 a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didn't
0 have ready negative feelings about being in, in Alaska at the time since they
0 voted absentee.  I, I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se-,
0 feeling of second class citizenry, uh, to be in a territory that large and not
0 being able to vote.  The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite
0 frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, those, are good points, um, which obviously I had never
0 are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would
0 state versus a territory.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Perhaps compulsory education.
0 B:  Uh, I see what you mean, so that, 
0 B:  Yeah, taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.  Uh, there, I don't know, I
0 stringent as they are in other states, I, and I'm thinking in terms of
0 education.  But then again each state sets its own and I don't know how a
0 territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico.  Um, it's
0 interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems
0 relative to, uh, economy, uh, I had thought of it more in terms of political,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well, well actually I thin-, one, one thing that I remember
0 they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always
0 assumed it was anyway.  So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem
0 to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might
0 because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or
0 B:  Uh-huh, well that's interesting too.  Well it sounds as though you are in
0 B:  And I think, uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I
0 wait to do more research before picking one of these.  So I'm ul-, I guess I'm
0 A:  Well that's interesting.
0 B:  ((leaning)) towards the statehood.
0 A:  Right.  What about if, if, um, they demanded to have Spanish as the
0 B:  I think I would be troubled, I suspect, I believe that any of our states,
0 and I, constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions abo-,
0 Um, I don't think there is any prohibitions.  I would be bothered by that.
0 I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's
0 strengths and that's the, the, the melting pot.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh, I, I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines, but I'm
0 troubled by too close a clinging to, to the past and I'm also realizing that,
0 that a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes
0 up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.  Uh, that I, I think that
0 would be a negative step to make and I think that that they would need to
0 reassess that.  Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, uh, in so far that
0 it intr-, it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect.
0 bilingual, Spanish based on experience, um, I was in bilingual education in
0 California and I didn't have any problem with my students but I noticed my, my
0 brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary
0 school and he can't speak a word.  
0 B:  Yeah, but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual,
0 A:   Right.
0 B:  and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was
0 required to learn English and a second language.
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  But I'm, I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally
0 bilingual at the official level.
0 A:  Oh, I see.
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  Well I think we have gone to time and I appreciate your having called.
0 B:  Good-bye.
0 A:  Uh, well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes?
0 [Breathing] [laughter].
0 B:  We, uh, well, uh, my, my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, um, [breathing] the, the how I met him was through, uh, the aerobics
0 A:  Uh-huh. You're a student?
0 B:  Yeah, so.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 athletic.  Enjoying a th-, you know, uh, anything dealing with sports.
1 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh, I'm, I am a person who wishes I had more time to exercise.  I, 
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 A:  I don't feel like I, I don't very often do things for the sake of exercise.
0 I don't feel well unless I am exercising and I try to do things that involve
0 any sort of structured, this is my exercise time --
0 A:  -- but, I do lots of outdoor sports and things, bicycling, uh, you know,
0 mountaineering, a little mountaineering, this and that, and I spend a lot of
0 time and I probably get more exercise than your average person.  But, it's not
0 a, a structured sort of thing, and I have to admit I have a certain resistance
0 to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and perhaps, it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun, or
0 something like that.
0 B:  Yeah, well I, I've, my, that's the way my mother stands on it.  She feels
0 like if it's something that you have to do, you know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  if you look at it as if you have to do it, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  then it becomes, it becomes a chore,
0 A:  Yes, #yes.#
0 B:  #and,# and, she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore.  So, um, and I feel
0 that way too as far as, you know, just sitting and doing, you know, to, the
0 idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something, you know, to,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  you know, three times a week or,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  but, but I do try and, um, I do try and regulate how much exercise I
0 get a week.
0 B:  And, it's got, and I've always enjoyed dance.  
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  So it involves, you know, I, I can't get out to dance all the time and, 
0 A:  Yeah, would that we could [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah, [laughter] and it's, and it's more regulated, I mean you're, you're
0 using different parts of the body.
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  So, it, it is like dance, an-, and it's structured like that, but you have
0 the music, and someone, like you said, someone else is counting,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And, someone else is telling me, okay, you know, let's move this way, let's
0 move that way,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  instead of me having to think about it so much.
0 A:  Right.  You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise and all
0 you do is follow along and enjoy yourself.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  But, I'm like you, I also, um, like to participate in, uh,
0 things like, well, we just went to the, uh, Myererson Symphony Run this past
0 weekend, and, and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet different people,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  and, um, just get out, you know,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  out and about, and it's, it, it's something you can all, like our, we did
0 B:  it was, it was quite a lot of fun.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  and, uh,
0 A:  Well, you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming
0 weather [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, I didn't realize that.
0 A:  Uh [laughter].
1 B:  I'm sorry.  
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Well, I'm in Texas.  I, I just assumed that I had, this is the first call
0 I've done,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and, I didn't realize that they ha-, were going to reach out to people
1 from,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  You wouldn't know that [laughter].  Oh, I, 
0 A:  So, it's the, it's, it's the, the act-, well it's actually, it's
0 interesting, because there are re-, real regional differences.  Um, in
0 California there's, uh, almost an assumption,
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 A:  um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation, or something,
0 you know, in your sixties, or something like that, I'm, I'm, I'm not.  Uh,
0 there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness, and,
0 and, at least in urban California.  And, maybe not, I don't know about rural
0 California too well.  But, in urban California it's just, you know, for all I
0 know aerobics started out here.  I don't know where they actually started, but
0 the running craze.  And, they, California gets, you know, tends to be a bit
0 faddish, but,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere.  So, there
0 must be something to some of them.  And, uh,
0 seem to be more health motivated all around.  I mean, as far as the diet, and
0 everything.  Uh, the diet and, uh, just your health consciousness, and, I mean,
0 it just,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  seems like, uh, a lot of those ideas generate out of California.  Not
0 just exercise, but,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  health, health related ideas.  And, I, it's curious, I don't know why,
0 don't know if it's, do you, does California have a,
0 A:  Well, there's a sense of it being a package, 
0 A:  I think.  There, there is a sense of, you know, whole, there's a lot of,
0 you know, you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or
0 puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER.  Which is, uh, turned into a fairly well
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and, and, it
0 doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or
0 anything.  It, it's on fairly so-, solid scientific ground.  Uh, it's just
0 dispensed with these distinctions.  It says ever-, all sorts of factors go
0 into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another, so
0 orientation for quite some time.  Um, there's been some progressive medical
0 schools out here,
0 B:  Uh-huh [breathing].
0 A:  that have taken that approach.  And, um, 
0 B:  Now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole
0 that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that
0 into their program.
0 A:  #Boy,#
0 B:  #Do you# think the program came #first or the,#
0 A:  #yeah, that,# there's a, I, I can say there's a correlation, but I
0 each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and
0 develop a little bit more, and a little bit more.
0 B:  Yeah, the more money they put into it.
0 A:  Yeah.  And, 
0 B:  I can see that.  And, cause, I, knowing from institutes of learning like
0 that, I know that they've got to get their money somewhere, and somebody's
0 got to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it, so,
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 A:  you know, in, back in the sixties, had a lot of alternative movements and
0 um, had an impact on the society around here.  And one of the ones that had an
0 similar to a stress management practice or alternates to, uh, A M A approved
0 out here.  And, and you could have them around long enough and more and more
0 people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other
0 things,
0 A:  and, before long, you, you get this, this whole kind of Gestalt, this
0 whole package of, of health, of health care and options --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- and, uh, and exercise is, is strongly considered one of them.  The irony
0 is, is its people in the cities, in my experience, that are most oriented
0 towards doing the exercise.  And, I guess because they spend all day in back
0 of their desks.  The average person out on the farm, at least traditionally,
0 now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- but at least traditionally, #the laborers, last thing,# 
0 B:  #Or they're older.#
0 A:  Pardon me.
0 B:  Well, don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar-.  I, I
0 sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in
0 A:  Oh, #like everything else.#
0 B:  #I live in a rural area,# so,
0 A:  #Yeah, yeah. The rat race to exercise [laughter].#
0 B:  #you know, I see that.# It's, yeah, it's, it's like it's frantic, to,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  you know, to, uh, achieve, something that, that a person in a rural area,
0 uh, almost doesn't worry about it to such a degree, but stays, you know,
0 A:  Yeah, well I, 
0 B:  as a fit person [breathing].
0 A:  I think so.  I mean you, you've, if you look at cert-, if you look at other
0 cultures, like I know a little bit about people who were considered very
0 healthy in China and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all.  But,
0 they do a lot of low keyed, low impact, low stress exercise, and they combine
0 it with a, you know, meditation or whatever.  Some sort of relaxation --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- and, they seem pretty, you know, they don't have the hard body.  They
0 don't have that perfect look, and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image
0 conscious.  But they, you know, they live to a hundred and ten some
0 [laughter], you know,
0 B:  Yeah,
0 B:  Well, don't you think a lot of that is diet too?
0 A:  and, a lot of that is diet.  That's true.
0 A:  Yeah, I mean, they eat, they eat a lot of carbohydrates, and not much fat.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Um, for economical reasons, not for preference.  Um,
0 B:  Yeah and as we can see.  Well, I'm a, I'm a practicing vegetarian so, uh,
0 I've read a lot of information, #knowing that to be true,# 
0 B:  What's that?
0 B:  Oh, are you also [laughter],
1 A:  Yes [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] Well that's, that's good as far as the cal-, is that, is that,
0 um, pretty predominant as far as California do-, doe-,
0 A:  It is in the urban areas, yes.
0 B:  In the urban areas?
0 A:  Most, for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little
0 vegetarian section now.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Oh that's wonderful.
0 A:  Well most, most, mo-, sort of modern looking restaurants will, 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  That's great, I mean, we, uh, it's such a chor-, it's such a trouble here.
0 I mean, you just have to eat at home basically.
0 and, and, and, uh,
0 B:  #Well of course in the cities,#
0 A:  #it occurred to me,#
0 B:  yeah, well, in the cities, we live close to Dallas, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  so, uh, which, you know, you get, uh, an influx of a lot of people from
0 all over the country, so,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
0 B:  you're going to have a lot of di-, more choices, but, 
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  and it's not a, you know, it's, uh, it's definitely, it, it's, it's
0 changing to a degree, but, um, it's very frustrating.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And, even, even with health food stores and stores where you can buy
0 natural products or, uh, organic, you know, materials,
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 a surprisingly mild, uh, winter.  Uh, we've had a lot more warm weather than
0 usual and we haven't had any ice storms.  Uh, usually we have at least one,
0 um, of course, I've only lived here three years, but, uh, but that, still in
0 that three years you could always count on at least one ice storm.
0 B:  My husband's been in Dallas during an ice storm.  He said that he pulled
0 the curb, that they're that bad.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 B:  Lubbock, we get ice storms but not, not quite to that extent.  It's not
0 the thin sheet, you know,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 it's something that you can drive on, you can get a little traction with.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh, I think we've been fortunate that we've missed any of the real bad
0 weather this year because we went to California instead [laughter].
0 A:  Oh [laughter].
0 B:  But right now, uh, we're having unusually warm weather.  It's, it's
0 B:  It's either, uh, thirty degrees, you know, one day and ninety the next
0 and, and we're, we're missing the fifties and sixties in there somewhere.  
0 A:  Right that's right, it's, it's the same way here.  How long have you lived
0 in Lubbock?
0 B:  Well, I have been here, permanently or full time since nineteen eighty.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, uh, pretty much off and on since seventy-four.  So really quite a
0 while.
0 A:  Wow, yeah.
0 B:  And I've watched the weather shift.  You know, I can remember being here
0 back in the seventies in college and the Spring dust storms were, uh, they
0 were massive.  I mean you could stand on one side of the street and not see
0 A:  Dust storms.
0 B:  That dust, yeah, [laughter] not fun to be in. 
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  But I haven't seen any like that in probably five or ten years.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  So it's, it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are
0 A:  Well I know when we first moved here it was, uh, it was at the very
0 beginning of the year in nineteen eighty-seven and, 
0 A:  uh, we, when we lef-, we moved from New Hampshire where it was snowing,
0 A:  [Throat_clearing] and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm
0 it was.  I mean, it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats
0 and everybody, and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this
0 weather.
0 B:  That's true.
1 New Hampshire you always have that kind of weather. 
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  But, um, uh, and I just, I just assumed that was the way it was.  You
0 know, didn't get snow, which was nice because you didn't have to shovel it
0 was, in the three years we've been here there's been one other ice storm.  Uh,
0 in the second year we had an ice storm and I was really surprised that, uh,
0 that we didn't have anything like that this year.
0 B:  Well, now does Dallas get snow, 
0 A:  [Throat_clearing].
0 B:  or is it usually just the ice storm?
0 A:  It, it, uh, it, if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown
0 grass, you know.
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  And, uh, certainly nothing that you have to do anything about, um,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  That was about as much winter as I could get because I grew up, West
0 Coast sunshine, green leaves on trees,
0 B:  came back here and could not realize why I had been so depressed through
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  and realized that that was the first time in my life I had seen trees
0 lose their leaves.
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  And, uh, and of course when Spring and everything came out again, uh, it
0 was beautiful but that's about as much winter as I can take.  I mean, it gets
0 cold here and with wind chill it sometimes gets, you know, fifteen, twenty
0 degrees below because of the wind.
0 A:  Right, yeah.
0 B:  But it's not six feet of snow and it doesn't stay on the ground six months
0 out of the year and,
0 A:  Right,
1 B:  I know the sun is coming.
0 in up in New England you had more winter than you had a, su-, summer.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 co-, you co-, in New England it would still be cold, I mean ice cold snow kind
0 of weather, uh, now, in March.  It's ju-, in March is, is just when things
0 start, uh, approaching the fifty degree mark.  And, of course, we've already
0 had eighty degree weather here, 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  and day, day before yesterday, it got up to eighty-eight I think.
0 B:  Well now when did winter start there?  You said you had more winter than
0 summer.
0 A:  Oh winter would start, oh yeah, winter would start, uh, in September.  It
0 would start getting cold in September.
0 B:  Now was there actually snow on the ground all tha-, that time from
0 September through what, March?
0 A:  There could be, yeah, 
0 B:  Oh goodness.
0 A:  there could be and, and it came, I mean, I used to, I used to work in
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 driveway,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  And, uh, so it would sometimes take me, you know, an hour or two to
0 shovel the driveway in the morning.  Then I'd sitting in that car for an hour
0 an a half, an, an, well it was actually, if the, if the weather was bad enough
0 to shovel snow it would take me three hours to get to work.
0 B:  Oh, my goodness.
0 B:  Well now was that expected though, 
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 to the delays or,  
0 expect you to be there and you, the schools.  
0 B:  Uh, yeah.
0 A:  Well you know they also did a very good job of, of shoveling the, the
0 streets.  They had the snow plows and the salt trucks and, and, uh, they just,
0 you know, they were equipped for it.  Where as, here, if you have a bad snow
0 A:  Right, right, you know, you'd, you'd, you get the first, you know, the
0 B:  Well now do you work at T I.
0 A:  Yes, uh-huh.
0 B:  I was going to say there have been several times when I know they had ice
0 storms down in Dallas, uh, that we would be up here trying to call,
0 B:  and it, we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody
0 ten minutes away and I don't, I don't work in the, at the Dallas site, I work
0 B:  Oh, okay [breathing].
0 A:  And, uh, and so I usually, I can usually make it in, it's just a hop,
1 jump, and, uh, uh, whatever the expression is, I'm, I'm real close [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] Hop, skip and a jump.
0 A:  #Yeah right [laughter].#
1 B:  #There you go.#
0 B:  Well that's good.
0 A:  I'd, I'd hate to have to get it, go to Dal-, drive into Dallas when the
0 you're getting in Dallas over your years in New Hampshire or do you miss the
0 A:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Well it's like I keep telling people, you don't have to
1 shovel sunshine, you know,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  it's, uh, it's, uh, this is great, I mean, we're really spoiled.  I mean
0 there's no trees to speak of, you know, and the big, you know, thick trees we
0 used to have in New England and we used to enjoy that.  We had, uh, we had two
0 acres of land attached to our house.
0 B:  Oh my goodness.
0 A:  Of course we only had a thousand square foot house but we had two acres
0 uh, and, uh.
0 A:  That's right, and, uh, so we kind of, it, it's, we've gone from one
0 extreme to the other and that's, that's been hard to adjust to.  But, uh, the
0 weather, oh the weather's been wonderful.
0 B:  That's good, I did go up to New England one time during their fall season,
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  you know, it was kind of, uh, a brisk feeling outside but it wasn't
0 freezing, the leaves were turning and now that part of a winter up there I
0 could truly love, but, uh.
0 A:  Yeah, oh, I can remember, uh, walking around, you know, taking a lunch
0 break, you know, when the air's real brisk and the, the colors on the trees
0 are just so vivid, um, uh, it's just, that, that's something I miss.  I, I
0 keep, I'm [laughter], I get homesick thinking about it.
0 B:  Uh, oh.  Well what about your summers in Dallas.  Now is that similar,
0 was it humid up in the New England states like it is down there?
0 weather, I mean in, in, like in the Boston area. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 Uh, here in, in Dallas, in the Dallas area, the humidity, you get some humid
0 days but it's not nearly as bad.  You ge-, you get a lot of dry days too.
0 B:  Well so that's no big ta-, I tell you what, that's funny to hear you talk
0 about that because for me to come to Dallas, in the summer it's stifling
0 humidity to me because Lubbock is so dry.
0 A:  Is it, okay.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  but there is no humidity and its, you know, if there's a breeze blowing
0 it's nice comfortable day,
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you,
0 you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity is so great, you know,
1 you're sweating to death again.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, yeah, everything is relative, I guess.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  I grew up on the east coast.
0 B:  Oh,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And compared to the humidity here, you know, in fact, uh, whenever I think
0 about moving, you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east
0 coast the thing that comes back to me is that sensation of those stifling
0 on the side, and I also like to, uh, do gardening, and also like to workout.
0 A:  I didn't think of working out as a hobby [laughter], 
0 A:  I do both at home. 
0 B:  yeah, well, I, I, uh, I work with computers at work and then I come home
0 and, and I have, uh, a little lap top at home that I just like to play with.
0 A:  Uh, we've gotten a little Atari computer.  My husband describes it as a, a
1 computer with training wheels.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  #Uh.#
0 B:  #Yeah.#  Well pottery sounds interesting have you made a lot of, uh, a lot
0 of vases and things or, 
0 B:  Oh.       
0 A:  Uh, you know you get them, you clean them up, you know, get the, uh, mold
0 uh, then you, uh, put it in a kiln and fire it.  You know, it's like a big
0 ov-, oven --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  -- and, uh, when you pull it out it's called bisque, uh, it started it off
0 with greenware when you first start off then it goes to bisque and that's when
0 you can paint it.
0 B:  Do you have your own kiln or do you,
0 A:  No, I've, uh, y-, you can rent people's kiln they, they, uh,
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and, uh, pay
0 them. There's one woman that charged ten dollars a month for fire, all that I
0 B:  Oh, 
0 B:  well, that, that doesn't sound like it's too expensive a hobby does, uh,
0 does the, uh, clay and, and the paints and things are they expensive?
0 A:  The paints and stuff can get expensive, the greenware it depends on what
0 you buy.  Now I bought a, a chess set for my husband and painted it for him
0 and I'd say the greenware for, you know, twenty-four pieces, I think is what
0 they're, no, no, thirty-two pieces.
0 A:  is a, was, co-, cost me about eight dollars.
0 B:  Well, that doesn't sound very expensive to me.
0 A:  No, I liked it I had fun with it. But, uh, you know, uh, I'm a little shaky
0 when it comes to detail work --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- so, I couldn't get the fine pieces, so, you know, I had, uh, get parts
0 that had big spaces in them.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh, couldn't do the fine tailed, fine detail on it. 
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  But, uh, you know, I made my son his, uh, Donald Duck and, you know, the
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Painted them for him in real bright colors. 
0 A:  And, uh, he enjoyed them until he was about two and then he, uh, had fun
0 B:  Oh, no, [laughter].  Well.
0 A:  That was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just
0 A:  Yeah, well, I didn't get mad at the kid, I got mad at my husband for giving
0 them to him.
0 B:  Well, well, I, I enjoy working out when I, I get home from work just to,
0 just to have something to do that, that I know isn't going, that's, that's
0 good for me, #something to do other than,#
0 B:  Excuse me?
0 A:  The people on the E S P N?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Occasionally I'll record one of the shows that's on in the morning while
0 I'm at work and I'll do them when I get home.
0 A:  Um, I don't work,
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  #so,#
0 A:  I haven't worked out in quite awhile.  I play volleyball, I guess that's
0 good enough workout.
0 B:  That is, that can be a, a w-, big workout.
0 B:  Do you play volleyball a lot? 
0 A:  At least once a week, uh, sometimes we play two ni-, games a night, you
0 know, consist of, uh, fifteen point game and you play two games, and, you
0 know, the best, uh, person that wins two games wins.
0 B:  Um. 
0 A:  And, uh, a few times we've had a tie breaker so I played three games and,
0 uh, then we'll get a half hour break, or so, and then I'll go and play another
0 set with somebody else, you know.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  It's fun.
1 B:  Yeah, I, I enjoy volleyball, I'm just not very good at it,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  and I end up [static] killing my knees. 
0 A:  Yeah, well, uh, I've torn mine up, uh, you know we play with a church team
0 A:  And, uh, when I played softball, it was with the church [child] team, it
0 was just for fun.  Although, the church team we made it to the nationals, we
0 were ranked fifteenth in the nation,
0 B:  Wow.
0 A:  so, I, you know, I'm proud of that.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  But, that was a, for anoth-, you know, I was in another state then.
0 I'll be playing again.
0 B:  Um, I have several friends that play softball.  They play softball in
0 different church leagues,
0 A:  It's,
0 B:  around town. 
0 A:  it's a good way to get out with people,
0 B:  [/Static]. 
0 A:  and you don't have to, uh, uh, let's see what's the word, to have fun
0 without doing the drinking and all that.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh [static].  
0 A:  I'll, you know, be nice and, uh, you know, it's going out to have fun.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 out after playing.
0 B:  No kidding, hobbies are supposed to be enjoyable.  They're not supposed to
0 be difficult, or, or, they're not supposed to make [\static] you less relaxed
0 than when you began.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- uh, [laughter] I've been, uh, trying to program some, uh, disc or some,
0 uh, what do you call them, putting some programs into the, on the disc, and,
0 you have entered a error,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  in line, and I don't see how people do that, that drives me batty.
0 B:  [Laughter] Well I, uh, I have a, a, Computer Information Systems degree
0 from school, and I've been at it awhile, so,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  you know, you just kind of learn the tricks of the trade and, and move
1 on [static].
0 A:  [Laughter] The closest I come to, uh, a having a, uh, program work on me
1 was the, the Atari, toot toot,
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] and you know, that was just a couple lines and you push a button
0 and you hear a train and then the, the toot toot [laughter],
0 B:  Uh, yeah.
0 A:  the kids like it, though.  They think it's a hilarious.
0 B:  Oh, now that's nice.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  But before then, I taught at the, the University of Houston and, um, so I
0 (( )).
0 B:  So what, business attire?
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 like you were the authority. I felt like,
0 B:  Right. 
1 A:  if I came in just in jeans or,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  or tattered clothes, that I didn't have as good control over the class.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  And if I tried to wear things that were a little bit more businesslike,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  And, uh, um, in my group, uh, nearly everyone wears a, a, sports coat and
0 tie.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 lenient and we can wear like, uh, an open collar or, um, a lot of times in the
0 summer, I'll try to, uh, like on a Friday, I'll try to take off half a day and
0 A:  Oh, that's nice.  
0 B:  So, uh, I'll try to wear a short sleeve shirt and, uh, um, and that, that's
0 okay. That's appropriate.
0 A:  Well, do you, um, meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way
0 for the clients or,
0 controller and, uh, we support a senior vice president.
0 B:  And, uh, the senior vice president is, uh, is big on business attire, and
0 his group.  So, um, I, I, I enjoy it. I think it makes a nice environment and,
0 um, I don't know, gives it a little more business type atmosphere.
0 A:  Well, I have noticed with my own children, for example, that they will,
0 depending on what they're wearing, it, it makes a big difference on how they
0 act.
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  See, I think that's exactly right, you know if, your, uh, if your dressed
0 in a, a suit and to me it ma-, helps me feel sort of like, what you were
0 president, I feel, I just have that little extra confidence in myself, being
0 dressed that way.
0 A:  Well, and I noticed in my teaching experience that, since a lot of the
0 people were my own age or older, even, um, that, because I taught English as a
0 second language, so I didn't have your average freshman,
0 B:  Oh, I see. 
0 A:  and, um, so I, I had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit
0 off their level.  You want to be friends with the students, but you don't
0 quite want to be their equal.
0 B:  Exactly.
0 B:  ((Oh, well, that and)) Houston, it would be so hot. 
0 it's hard to walk a long way,
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  and the campus is pretty large,
0 B:  I see. 
0 A:  so I preferred slacks, and, um, you know, kind of dressy shirts and
0 things but,
0 A:  so that I would look a little bit different and I would come in and I
0 would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did
0 and,
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  that helped with their discipline and,
0 A:  didn't make me have to much trouble and,
0 B:  Right, right.
0 A:  with the students. 
0 B:  And I think clothing you know, is just, uh, it does, like you were saying
0 the way you dress, makes you feel different ways.
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  Um, if you, like when you go out at night, uh, you may just want to have a
0 casual evening or something, so you sort of dress down, but if your going to
0 a change on your attitude.
0 A:  Well, I noticed since we moved down here to Texas, my husband is originally
0 from Texas, but, uh, I'm not,
0 B:  I see.
0 A:  And, since you don't have to have, uh, such a wide variety of seasonal
0 clothes that you do up north,
0 B:  I'm, I'm sure that is true, yeah. 
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  you know, heavier wools and,
0 B:  Yeah, see the winter season is just not that long to, to invest a whole lot
0 of money in, in, uh, the heavier, heavier materials.
0 A:  No, and you don't, um, you know, if, you usually can wear pretty close to
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  or something, rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe
0 B:  Exactly, exactly.
0 tops on them,
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  rather than just the lower skim, skimmers. I think they call them that,
0 you would wear day-to-day but,
0 B:  See I think ladies clothing, um, uh, is a lot more varied than, than, than
0 men's clothing.  Because, uh, men, or at least in my situation, you can, uh, I
0 can wear the same slacks and sports coats nearly all year-round.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  And, uh, ladies you know, uh, uh, I don't know if that's marketing or what,
0 but they, they definitely have a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and
0 be,
0 B:  True.
0 A:  acceptable. You know, if you wear, um, pastels, it needs to be warm
0 weather [laughter].
0 B:  Right. 
0 isn't dark colors attract the sun,
0 B:  Right.   
0 B:  Exactly.  Plus the social attitude, you know, if you, you walk into a place
0 and, and, uh, I know in our office, um, our secretary gives everyone, uh, all
0 the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes.  I think it's, uh, is it
0 after Labor Day or something, I don't know,
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  and, um, so you know the, the social attitude has a little bit to do
0 with, I think the way we dress.
0 A:  That's true, there's some rule that's like between Labor Day, uh, no, is it
0 Labor Day or Memorial Day?
0 B:  I'm not for sure, it's, that one in September is when you need to quit.
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 A:  And the one that's like in May.   
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  You can only wear, and supposedly, we don't have an opportunity, my
0 a white dinner jacket or something [laughter].
0 B:  I see, right. 
0 A:  And so, you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those,
0 B:  Exactly, exactly.
0 B:  Exact-, a lot more, uh, that's right, a lot more helpful ideas,
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  rather than our appearance.
0 B:  I live here in Plano. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  that there, there is a pretty, um, I wouldn't say snobish [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  it kind of borders on that if I, depending on what I'm wearing, I get
0 better service at the mall.
0 B:  Oh, really. 
0 B:  Huh-uh.
0 A:  uh, since, where, you know, where I've lived in Houston that,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  -- you need to be, you can't just come in off the street. 
0 B:  And I think that's, you know, a North Dallas type attitude. 
0 A:  Oh, is it? 
0 seems like people really dress up a lot more here in North Dallas going to
0 church and, um, now that's, that's, uh, because uh, uh, I went to school at,
0 uh, Texas Tech in Lubbock.
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  And, uh, church was a lot more casual, uh, rather than, uh, you know here
0 it's like going to a fashion show almost.
0 A:  Yes, I think, I think your right.  I've noticed that too. It's very
0 different, but I've, I think it's kind of sad when you have to make, have to
0 dress up when you go somewhere.  I mean, just to the (( )).
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And you have to be sure that your, everything coordinates and,
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  You can't just wear your sweats and an old tee-shirt. 
1 A:  No, [laughter] you can't. 
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 I've, it's interesting to hear a man's point of view.  It's usually my
0 husband, he's got a pretty good deal.  I go out and buy all his clothes
1 [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] and now that is.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Well, thank you, you have a good day.
0 A:  Okay.  Bye-bye.
0 B:  Where is that?
0 A:  Uh, it's about thirty miles from Sherman. 
1 B:  Well, you live almost in Oklahoma [laughter].
0 B:  ((Yeah)).  That's kind of ironic, because I don't live too far from
0 Oklahoma either.
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  You know where Saint Joe is? 
0 A:  Uh, I've been through there. 
0 watching the news and reading the papers and all that, it sounds like the
0 crimes in the cities are really getting bad.
0 B:  Well, you know, I've, I've seen those statistics and everything, and you
0 know, what frightens me, is that, you put a half a million people out in the
0 middle of the desert --
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  -- with high tech weaponry, you know, I mean, the Iraqis didn't have a lot
0 of high-tech weaponry, but they had mortars and machine guns,
0 A:  Oh, yeah. 
0 A:  Sure. 
0 intending to kill people,
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 just, murder is nothing to them, you know.
0 to me, even, that if a guy is convicted, or a gal is convicted, of a crime,
0 rather than put them in prison, because prison's proven not to work, just let
0 them go.  Say okay, you're convicted --
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 B:  -- and if they get convicted again, well, just kill them.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, because, uh, most likely that will happen, won't it,
0 B:  Well, I think that the best hope to eliminate crime, as we know it today --
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  -- is to eliminate the criminals from society. 
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  If someone is known to have been in prison, they can't get a job.
0 A:  No. 
0 B:  They can't be accepted into society.  You know, if they're not going to be
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  And, you know, who's to put the limit on it?  I mean, I was watching a
0 offenses, on a regular basis [laughter].  You know, I mean, some of these
0 guys are forty years old and got ten convictions.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  And they're still let out on the street after one or two years.  Well, in
0 Washington State, if you're a habitual sexual offender, they just don't let
0 you out.
0 A:  Um.
0 and if you're pronounced cured, they'll let you go.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  Well, they may find a cure for it, but there is no known cure now.
0 A:  Um.  So you're, you're kind of thinking, in other words, if you get, if you
0 do something the first time, that's not real bad, you know,
0 B:  ((Hey)), people make mistakes. 
0 B:  Well, yeah, ((use)) that or, you know, there's other consequences rather
0 than killing them, you know, you could,
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime
0 against.
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  You know. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  At least they might {voices have faded} get some benefit in that, and if
0 these people have learned their lesson, are, are okay, you know, well, they
0 can free them.
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  But, uh, you know, with the technology we have today, you can put a collar
0 on a guys leg that will knock him down if they leave the property. I mean, it
0 will just in incapacitate them.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  And, you can put a collar around a guys leg that will prohibit them from
0 committing any kind of prohibitive act.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  But, you know, putting them in prison, my God, that doesn't work.
0 A:  No, apparently not, because look how many years they've been doing that and
0 look [laughter], I mean, yeah.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  for just about everything. 
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 kill you.  You get convicted of, uh, you know, heinous crimes, they just kill
0 you.  I mean there's no two ways about it.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  And, uh, you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few.
0 You know, and you look at our society, almost everyone out on the street that
0 has been in prison, has been in prison three or four times.
0 A:  Three or four times, yeah. 
0 B:  I mean,
0 B:  You know, the way to stop that kind of behavior is, is two-fold.  One,
0 you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under
0 seven.  I, I think that's very important.
0 A:  Oh, I'm, I agree very much so on that, I, yeah.
0 B:  And then, if a parent has proved to be unfit, for any reason --
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  -- take the kids away from the parents. 
0 B:  Because, you know, we are what we teach. 
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  We have just a bunch of people, and I've, and I've, I've lived in that,
0 You know, and these guys, they come to work every morning and they're stoned
0 to the bone. I mean, their so high, they could fly up to the top of that
0 building and they work all day, and they go home and they smoke their dope and
0 go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money,
0 and then they go back to work on Monday.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  And, the kids of these people (( )).
0 A:  Sure, they just think that's the normal thing to do, don't they ...
0 B:  They're sociopathic.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester --
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  -- and these kids were more foulmouthed than I've ever been.  I had one
0 kid threaten my life,
0 A:  In the first grade [laughter].
0 B:  Threaten my life.  Told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death.
0 A:  Oh, know [laughter].
0 B:  You know, and they flipping me the finger and all that -- 
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 step into mainstream society or you can die.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  Because you will eventually be killed.  And, I just, I'm just totally
0 aghast at a what's going on.
0 A:  Oh, I know.  I know, um, I work in school.  You know, that's something I do
0 and I, it really is ((I'm like you)) astonishing what the younger ages know,
0 and they react to what they see at home.  You know.
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 at school.
0 B:  Exactly.
0 A:  You know.  It really is, and that's kind of sad. 
0 B:  Well, you can see it in the work place, you know.  Used to be when you had
0 a personality conflict you just, you worked with it and you got through it.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  Now, you know, people get fired, or [laughter] what's even worse, is they
0 promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them get fired.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Or, one thing or the other.  You look at another kind of society like the
0 Japanese.  You put that many people on that small of a space, they've learned
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 becoming a great power, financially, the people that worked for those
0 companies, worked for the same company they worked for at sixty-five, as they
0 did when they were eighteen.
0 A:  Teen.
0 B:  And the company, took it upon itself to find a position for these people.
0 You know, transcribing stuff into the computer.
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Um, I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting, when I do have spare time.
0 A:  Really, I like cross-stitch too.    
0 A:  [Laughter] I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately.
0 A:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.    
0 B:  Have you been cross-stitching long?    
0 A:  Oh, several years.  My husband is even interested in it now.  He likes to
0 help me design, um, you know, projects that are,
0 A:  a little more customized.    
0 B:  Mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from
0 there to the material [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, it's not.  
0 B:  And once you get started on it, it's just, oh, I just, I love it.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  I do a lot of my own patterns also.  
0 A:  Yeah.    
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 you have any others, or is this mainly cross-stitching?
0 A:  Um, I do mostly that, um, not very artistic really for like painting and
0 stuff.
0 B:  Oh, uh-huh.  Um,
0 A:  But, now I don't know.  
0 B:  Yeah.  I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, really [laughter].  Yeah, I've got the kits to put them all in.  I
0 don't have them all yet [talking] --
0 B:  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  
0 A:  -- certainly.  
0 B:  Yeah.  I got to counting the other day and, uh, I think I have, what was it
0 two hundred, and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this
0 [laughter] is, uh, it, yeah, it can add up quick.
0 then when I start a new project, I go through and see if I, if I, you know,
0 just buy the colors that I need --
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- of what I'm low on.  
0 B:  Right.  I see.  Well, now can I improvise with adding and using another
0 color instead, you know, what comes close.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Because a lot of them are similar.  
0 A:  Yeah.  A lot of times you can do that.  I think, I the pinks, there's like
0 forty-two different shades of pink.
0 B:  Good grief [laughter].  Yeah, there's lots of #pinks and greens.#
0 A:  #Pinks and greens.#  Yeah.  
0 B:  There's lots of shades of greens.  But the colors, I just love all the
0 different colors.
0 B:  They had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to.  But,
0 you don't have much spare time either?
0 A:  Well, not lately [laughter].  I just started a new job and trying to get
0 acclimated there.
0 B:  Oh, yes.  And that does take some time.  And if we're trying to get
0 acclimated with the, uh, with having a baby, and (( )).
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 A:  [Laughter].    
0 B:  Oh, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.  I've been trying to do some
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  We missed it last year, so hopefully this year he'll have one.
0 B:  Right.  
1 A:  He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway [laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter].  (( )).  
0 B:  Right.  If it tasted good, yeah.  All he liked was the lights this year,
0 so.
0 A:  Oh, yeah.    
0 B:  Oh, well, that's neat that you like cross-stitching also.   
0 A:  Yeah, that's, that's kind of strange [laughter] that we got the same call.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  It's a (( )) call.  
0 B:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  
0 A:  No, that's okay.  
0 B:  Okay [laughter], uh, but, yeah, I've been doing it for probably ten years
0 or so.
0 A:  Oh, wow.  No, I just started about, well, five years ago, I think.
0 B:  But it is peaceful, I mean it is relaxing to do, once you find the time to
0 A:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].  There's also a couple of large projects, baby
0 afghans, and I got one done and I think the other one is going.  The child is
1 going to be in high school before I get finished.
0 B:  [Laughter] On that, uh --  
0 A:  ((Bear thing)).  
0 the large squares?
0 A:  Well, yeah I just, I bought the cloth and the pattern for it.  I didn't,
0 um, I didn't buy the, uh, I didn't buy a kit.
0 B:  Oh, uh-huh.  Well I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for
0 A:  Uh-huh.  It's that cloth.  
0 B:  Oh, okay.  
0 A:  It's an-, cloth I think.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  And it has the borders and everything already.  
0 A:  Number one turned out just great, and the lady said she couldn't believe
0 that they know that I had done it in the colors, that they had decorated the
0 nursery and I didn't even know it.
0 B:  Oh, that's a (( )).  
0 A:  I gave it to her and she said how did you know those are the colors we
1 used.  I said {pause} didn't [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] That was a good (( )).  
0 A:  It worked out that way.  
0 B:  That's great.  Uh, that, uh, now I've got the material to do an afghan that
0 I just never did get around to finishing it.
0 B:  I like those.  Those are pretty.  
0 Oh, no.  She said, I know she doesn't get to touch it.  She hung it on the
0 wall.
0 B:  Yes, my, uh, grandmother, um, made us a couple of quilts for the baby, and
0 B:  Uh, there just too nice.  I mean you don't get many hand made quilts
0 anymore.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  True.  
0 B:  Well, I've enjoyed this.  
0 A:  Okay.  
0 B:  All right, thanks.  
0 A:  #Uh-huh, bye bye.#  
0 the phone lines, it was, it was incredible.  It, um, it occurred about two
0 been out heat, without power, um, without a phone.  We've basically been
0 living out of suitcases, at friend's house that happened to have power. It's
0 really been horrible.
0 B:  Where do you live?
0 A:  Well, um, living in Rochester, New York.
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  So, we normally, you know, this time of year it's very cold and we have a
0 seen an ice storm like this before.
0 B:  Oh.
0 They were estimating it was getting down to about thirty degrees inside the
0 B:  Oh, my word.
0 A:  It's really been crazy.
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, we've had unseasonably warm weather here in Texas.  We,
0 A:  Uh.
0 B:  Um, last week, it was, I believe, um, I believe it was Monday or Tuesday we
0 had, had ninety-four degrees.
0 A:  Are you serious?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Do, are you someone that likes the heat?
0 then.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Um, the summertime, the summer's here get heat real hot,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and I have a hard time with those but I get use to them.  You just kind of
0 stay indoors.
0 A:  What is it normally like there,
0 B:  Um,
0 A:  this time of year?
0 B:  this time of year sixties and, you know, stuff like that so.  Today,
0 A:  So would it,
0 B:  I think it's about sixty-five today, here, something like that.  So,
0 A:  Today, it sixty-five?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh, that's great.
0 B:  Yeah.  It's,
0 A:  You must be feeling like it's, uh,
0 B:  Yeah, my husband's outside in a short sleeve shirt right now working in
0 A:  Oh, that's so nice.
0 tree's blooming so we have very warm weather here right now,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  compared to what you're having.
0 A:  Yeah [laughter] ((considerably)).
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  we get ice storms here but we haven't had one in, you know, in a long time.
0 But,
0 B:  Um, the lowest temperature that it gets here, um, in the wintertime, this
0 winter we had, um, some temperatures get below zero and,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and then with the wind chill it got lower but that was,
0 A:  ((That is so wild)).
0 B:  It was, you know, it doesn't, you know it was real unusual.
0 A:  This past Thursday we had winds and, and snow to the point where if you
0 walked outside and if you're walking against the wind you almost couldn't move
0 B:  Um.  Are people going to work around there in this?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and then on Tuesday, I would say about half of the businesses were closed.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Um, they finally opened up again, I don't even say as normal because
0 nothing was really normal this week.  People were [throat_clearing] faced with
0 A:  It's just, it-, as a matter of fact, um, Governor Cuomo, the Governor of
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  is supposedly asking Bush, now, to declare Rochester, um, a disaster area
0 and,
0 A:  obviously to get some funding to help clean up this mess.
0 A:  But it's really, you know, and besides just the inconvenience of it all
0 it's, it's pretty sad because Rochester has some nice parks,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and some really beautiful tree lined streets and there all just, just
0 destroyed.  They were all torn down, um, the ice it was really just a
0 crippling thing for,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  the whole city. 
0 B:  You know, when we get snow and ice here it just shuts down the city.
0 A:  I can imagination that be-,
0 B:  Yeah, because nobody knows how to drive in it so,
0 B:  when you get, I mean, here they start even to forecast the weather, you
0 know, it's going to be an ice storm tomorrow, they'll come, before the ten
0 clock news they've already got schools calling in saying they've canceled.
0 A:  Really?
0 B:  Yeah, they don't even wait around here to see if they canceled it
0 B:  the night before and [noise].  And we've had, you know, say that they're
0 going to be, get this real bad ice storm and,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  um, it's beautiful the next day.
0 A:  Oh [laughter].
0 B:  The weather here is so unpredictable, you know, I don't even put much stock
0 in the weather reports,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  because they're hardly ever accurate. 
0 A:  Well, I grew up in Boston and in Boston, um, we get our share of snow, but
0 it is always very, very well cleaned up.
0 A:  They would be, the plows would be on the streets and they would salt and
0 sand and, you know, it would, the next morning it would be fine.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And in Rochester they, I guess they feel that they get so much snow that
0 they don't clean it up just for a little bit,
0 A:  so even for three or four inches your just driving right on it.  The
0 streets haven't been plowed,
0 B:  Uh.
0 A:  there's no salt on the ground.  Nothing.  They wait until they get a major
0 B:  Yeah they wait a little bit of rain here and they a it's going to freeze
0 and the sand trucks are out.
0 A:  Oh, really.
0 B:  Yeah, we have, you know, it gets, even in a rainstorm here that roads get
0 so slick,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  you know, not even cold weather but just rain because the roads get so
0 oily,
1 B:  that, uh, we've had, you know, twelve car pile ups [noise], 
0 A:  [Laughter]  Really. 
0 B:  on the free ways because,
0 A:  Oh, my gosh. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  So,
0 B:  {Talking to someone else in room}.
0 B:  Oh, no, no I'm talking to my daughter.
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  She wanted her shoe off.
0 B:  I'm sorry.
1 B:  No, no.
1 B:  I was talking.  My little girl wanted her shoes off.  
0 A:  [Laughter] Well, I just came back from getting our new clothes for day and,
0 B:  Uh.
0 they're having company this weekend, so we had to move,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and you just feel your imposing on people.  You know?
0 A:  Oh, no.  They're averaging, um, well, there estimating that next, by next
0 Thursday, everybody should have there power back.
0 B:  My word.
0 A:  The schools were all closed this week and, there still thinking of closing
0 them on Monday because for little kids it's, it's still kind ever dangerous
0 A:  hanging down and, and they're a lot of streets that are just closed
0 because you just can't drive on them and there's too many trees and that sort
0 every single store in Rochester has been sold out of batteries.
0 A:  Because people are needing batteries, for portable radios and flashlights
0 and,
0 B:  You need to stock up to batteries then.
0 A:  Really.  And we had, you know, a refrigerator full of food,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  just, you know, you can't use it.  It's, it's just gone bad.  So, this
0 storm really, it's, uh, it's been incredible.
0 out real fast.
0 A:  Right.  Exactly.  As a matter of fact, we made on to, I don't know if you
0 ever watch Dan Rather,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  the C B S news.  He mentioned, um, I guess it was Monday night or Tuesday
0 made national news.
0 A:  But, I don't know. I would,
0 A:  much rather be in the warm (( )).
0 A:  ((Um)).
0 B:  Yeah, because it's beautiful here today, I haven't gone outside been too
0 busy working inside,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  but it's beautiful here.
0 A:  Well, throughout all of this I called my in-laws who live in Florida,
0 A:  and they just finished putting in a pool, so, hun, this city freezing and a
0 know, a glass of wine and,
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  Oh, was really, it was horrible.
0 A:  But,
0 B:  It's amazing how it can be so different in one part of country.
0 A:  It really is. 
0 B:  Because I have family in Boston, too. 
0 A:  Oh, you do? 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Oh. I remember the earthquake last year and,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But going through it is so much different.  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah.  Exactly.  You just never think it could happen to you.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  Yeah, because his family, my husband's family, lives in, um, Anaheim,
0 California, you know, just a couple, you know, miles from Disneyland and,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  So, it's amazing how it, you know, it can be cold here and beautiful there.
0 A:  Yeah, that's true. 
0 B:  Yeah {while yawning}. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  but right now people, uh, the cool that (( )),
0 B:  You could never get use to that kind of weather.
0 A:  No, that's true.  But there is some people that just love it.  I mean
0 they are people that even if it gets to, uh, sixty degrees they feel that's
0 too hot,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And they just, they enjoy the snow and they enjoy the cold and, and that's
0 why they live here, I guess,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  But you, for the month between basically November and April if you don't
0 like the snow and the cold then you might as well pack your bags and leave,
0 B:  Uh-huh. Right.
0 A:  because that's all that's all there is here.
0 B:  That's how it was in Wyoming too, you just, you know it was always cold and
0 then, you can, you only had, um, two or three months that you could plant a
0 A:  Oh, really. 
0 B:  and here we can get three gardens in a year. 
0 B:  We can replant three times a year and get stuff.
0 A:  That is great.  What do you plant this time of year?
0 B:  Um, we've got onions and potatoes and, um, broccoli and all that kinds of
0 stuff like that but,
0 A:  Hi. Today is, uh, Saturday.  Have you found spare time to do any hobbies?
0 uh, bought myself another cactus plant.
0 A:  Is that right? 
0 B:  I've got many, uh, shrubs inside the house. 
0 A:  Inside your house? 
0 B:  Inside, yeah, uh-huh. 
0 A:  Like cactus gardens and,
0 B:  Uh, yeah, in, in the south window in the bathroom I've got, uh, quite a
0 few.
0 A:  That's nice. 
0 B:  Uh, along with all the other, uh, uh, plants I've got in the house, a lot
0 A:  We do the same kind of things, though.  We've been concentrating on outside
0 lately, trying to do some gardening and, uh, planting a lot of trees and
0 flowers.
0 B:  Yeah, I, I'm assessing the damage outside right now.  I've got couple of, a
0 few shrubs I need to replace outside.
0 A:  From the winter?
0 B:  Yeah.  They didn't, uh, 
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  survive the freeze.
0 We mo-, moved here from Colorado not too long ago where we had a really big
0 garden, [barking] but here, I, I don't know, I, I hear, I hear that the
0 growing is a little bit different.  Have you had a garden?
0 B:  Uh, yeah, well I've got, uh, oh, several shrubs outside,  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  uh, out there, uh, #depending on,# 
0 A:  #Have you# ever tried any vegetables? 
0 B:  No vegetable gardens.  Uh, I used to have that when I lived with my folks
0 A:  That's what we had, yeah, #we just,#
0 B:  #no vegetables# here, a lot of evergreens. 
0 take that heat.  #We'll see.#
0 B:  #Well,# there, there's quite a few that can handle that, um, any local
0 nursery will be able to help you with, with something like that.
0 A:  That's true. 
0 interested in?
0 A:  Well, I do some, oh, some needle craft things, hobbies sometimes, some
0 cross stitch, um, no, no sewing or knitting, any of that.  Um, little things,
0 some cross stitch, you know, some gifts that I make for friends and families,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  that kind of thing.  Anything else you, you do in your #spare time?#
0 B:  #Oh, yeah, I# play softball a couple of times a year. 
0 B:  It's, there getting ready to start up the, the season again. 
0 A:  I have two small children, so I started to, you know, have them enrolled
0 like in soccer and things like that.  I tend to be more of a spectator these
0 days than participating.
0 B:  On a day like today, it's so nice outside you like to get out there and do
0 something, uh,
0 A:  Yeah, it's beautiful. 
0 B:  We need to break out the bicycle, too, and get that down and start to ride
0 around.
1 A:  Mine has got a flat tire, so I'm going to have to do something about that.
0 B:  [Laughter] Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Well, I don't, uh, have too much else I do in my spare time, how about you?
0 wood.
0 A:  Is that right? 
0 B:  #And,# 
0 A:  #Did# he sell them at craft shows and,
0 B:  Yeah, they go to arts and crafts fairs,
0 B:  and, uh, they have their, uh, stand that they set up and display all
0 their, uh, all their products,
0 A:  Oh, that's neat.
0 B:  lots of vases and plates and bowls,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  things of that nature.  I'm probably the best customer. 
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Is it pottery or is it #wood?# 
0 B:  #No,# it's, it's wood turning. 
0 A:  Oh, that's #beautiful.# 
0 B:  #He's got,# got a lathe and all kinds, he's got a shop full of equipment --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- and they, uh, he turns, turns out bowls and vases of all different types
0 A:  Oh, that sounds neat.  How about like big salad bowls and those kind of
0 things?
0 of vases.  Uh, ones that stand on the floor and others that you can put on
0 tables, and, uh, he's been doing a lot of, uh, a lot of decorative type plates
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Boy they sound nice.  Well, I don't think I've ever seen wooden
0 plates at any of the craft shows.
0 B:  Okay.  Uh, well, there are shops around here that have, uh, items like
0 that.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh, not too many with the style that he uses though.   
0 A:  That sounds like a unique item. 
0 so it,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  it's something to do in the spare time.  They've got a lot of time to, to
0 work on that now.
0 @@A:  Well, it was good talking to you. 
0 B:  Okay.  
0 A:  All right.
0 B:  is that, uh, that's [laughter],
0 A:  Good luck with your indoor gardening there. 
0 A:  I'll talk to you later. 
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#  Bye-bye. 
0 =============================================================================
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  All right.  Do you have any kids?
0 B:  No.
0 A:  I've got two and it is hard to find day-care for them.
0 B:  What, um, what do you think needs to be the criteria set for those?
0 {pause}.
0 A:  [Breathing] [laughter] Oh [baby].
0 B:  What would you like to see in one?
0 A:  Well, I, I've seen the bad side in most of them.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I took my son to a day-care one time when he was, ju-, ri-, you know, just,
0 uh, not even three month old and, uh, you know, it was a desperate thing, and,
0 crying a-, the whole time.  He was a sleep but, you know, how they cry in
0 their sleep?
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And, uh, you know, this, uh, couldn't catch his breath even in his sleep,
0 and that turned me off of day-cares.
0 A:  And then, when I took, uh, I've seen these kids that, uh, it's a church
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and, uh, one of the girls was real mean to the kid. 
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  And that was, you know, he, she'd just, she had treated him like family
0 does.
0 A:  You know.  And, um, you know, it, uh, I know most of the girls up there and
0 the ones that keeps my kids are real good.  Uh, my son doesn't like people too
0 much,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  but, uh, when, when we leave there he's, uh, gives the girl a hug and
0 tells her, I'll miss you, so,
0 B:  Oh, well that's good.
0 A:  you know, so, I know they treat him good.
0 A:  Uh [child_talking].
0 B:  Is it, I don't know, maybe would you think a better student to teacher
0 ratio.  Do they have too many kids in most day-cares for the,
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0 B:  people they have?
0 A:  Uh, I, I don't know much about day-cares itself, you know,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  uh, you know, this is more of just the nursery for three and under and,
0 uh, there's only, there's two people taking care of about five kids, uh, where
0 I'm f-, where I'm taking my two.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And, but, uh, in most places, yeah, they got forty-five kids, at bes-, I
0 guess --
0 B:  Oh, my goodness.
0 A:  -- you know, and maybe about four teachers and that's a lot of kids.
0 B:  Yeah.  Um,
0 B:  we don't, yeah, we don't have any but we have, you know, plenty of
0 sisters and brothers that, that have them and I, I'm not sure that there is a
0 solution to that, as far as, uh, th-, th-, d-, you know, everybody has in
0 their mind the kind of day-care that they want, but it seems, you know, that
0 there's not really the perfect one out there.
0 A:  No, there's not.  Nobody can take care of your kids better than you.
0 B:  Right.  And that's not even possible anymore, [barking] I don't think, to
0 be able to take care of your own kids without, you know, with everybody
0 working these days.
0 A:  Well, I had to quit my job because of, um, m-, my two.  You know, um,
0 day-care-wise, baby-sitting-wise and stuff [noise], um, because, you know, my
0 sister was keeping them, uh, uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  we just lucked out and she, uh, met a military man who lived down here
0 and we came down here for T I, and, uh, so I had her baby sitting but she was
0 B:  Oh, yeah. 
0 A:  getting too much for her.  So, I just quit.  I'd rather quit and take
0 care of my own kids than let somebody else raise them.
0 B:  Yeah, that seems probably the best way to do it.
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I haven't really, the only day-cares that I have been
0 familiar with are the ones that are local here with the churches and they seem
0 A:  Yes.
0 B:  just because of what they're based on.
0 A:  Yeah.  If, um, I, I know one church that, uh, there was some problems with
0 but that was just, uh, basically a personal problem between,
0 B:  [Cough].
0 A:  the mother and the, uh, person that was ta-,
0 B:  Oh.
0 to a day-care, you know, it's, uh, during Sunday school and stuff.  Uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  the people there are really nice.
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thi-, I think that's, that's important.
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, they, I think it's one of the important things.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 separation thing,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  and I need, tha-, my kids I need to cut the strings on them, they're not
0 very old but,
0 B:  How old are they?
0 A:  Three and, uh, four and two.
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  So, you know, they're, they're good kids.
0 A:  You know, they do bad things but they're good kids.
1 B:  Well, you know, kids, kids [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  do those.
0 A:  Yeah. Uh, but, I don't like the punishment the day-care does.  You know, I
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  do but I don't want no one punishing my kids but myself,
0 B:  Right.  Right.
0 A:  And if,
0 have any type of, uh, formal or informal spontaneous or routine drop ins of
0 agencies, you know, people checking up on, like they do nursing homes, you
0 know.  They drop in to see if you're meeting all of the requirements by law
0 and, and I think they need to do that with day-cares and just see what's going
0 on.
0 A:  Yeah, that's, that's, that's something that should be brought up with these
0 people.
0 B:  So, but I'm not really sure.
0 A:  I don't know if they do it either to be truthful.
0 B:  Yeah, I don't either.  It's not until you have kids, I guess, you
0 A:  Well, uh, with me I just decided not to face it,
0 A:  and you know, in most, in, in so many words, you know, in one way or the
0 other I just decided not to face that issue and I just keep them with me.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well, I don't know what we've done to solve any of this [laughter]
1 but I've enjoyed talking with you.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, so have I.  ((Well)).
0 B:  And welcome to Texas.
0 A:  Y-, well, thanks and I guess I, we-, we've been on long enough so you have
0 @B:  Yes.
0 A:  Okay.  Um, well, how do you feel about food and cooking?
0 B:  Oh, I love food and I love to cook.  I really love to cook.  I'm not a
0 really gourmet cook.  I'm just a normal everyday cook.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  What about you?
0 A:  Well, we're vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for, I, I just
0 became a vegetarian over the past, uh, year and a half and it's a real
0 challenge to find foods, {rattling noise in background} proper foods to eat,
0 and it's a real challenge not to become, like what they call a junk food
0 junkie where your menu is composed of, uh, [breathing] things that you want to
0 B:  Don't you, do you miss meat at all?
0 A:  I did at first but, um, not really, no, not, I, I can't imagine eating
0 meat.  Um, the reason I tranged, uh, changed to become a vegetarian was for
0 ethical reasons, so, the idea of me eating meet would be like eating
0 something, you know, I, I think of it as something alive, you know.  So, it, I
0 can't do it.  You know, f-, for me,
0 A:  it's, it just, but I do, sometimes when I smell meat, you know, when I
0 smell particularly, uh, say steak or something, you know, that, I, I do admit
0 that I, you know, s-, wish, you know, that I could have that flavor but
1 [laughter],
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 or, you know, when you cook for company, do you fix just all vegetables?
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah, you, you'd be surprised the things, I mean, you could, like
0 tonight we're having, uh, nature burgers which are like a grain burger and you
0 can, it's, really pretty good, I, I, the people I serve it to, like my sister
0 and family members, well, my family members are vegetarians now basically, I
0 mean they're not, they're not when they go out to eat they sometimes eat
0 other, you know, meats and things but at home we eat vegetarian meals.  And,
0 people are use to eating --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- that wouldn't offend, you know, that they wouldn't be offended that
0 can make a pizza that's not, that doesn't have any animal produ-, animal, you
0 know.  You don't have animal products,
0 A:  Yeah.  We do eat, I, I had become, for about three or four months I was
0 vegan, which is a person that eats, um, no animal products, no cheeses, no
0 adds so much to meals, you know, when you put cheese on something or,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 substitutes for eggs when you're baking and cooking and things.
0 A:  So, although you can, I mean there's cookbooks and there's ways to do it.
0 It's a lot more expensive too.  I think, you know, the the, the market is just
0 not made for a vegan.  So, but, um, 
0 B:  But it's becoming more that way I think it's probably easier now to find
0 things.
0 grocery store and they had lentils and I, you know, I wasn't really sure
0 whether they would have lentils in the grocery store.  We've been living in
0 Bermuda and in Bermuda they had a, um, {click with mouth} a health food store
0 that really had a lot of good stuff and where we're living now is a small town
0 that really doesn't, you know, just having that kind health food store that
0 caters to those kind of needs.  And you just have to hope that the grocery
0 store will, {rattling noise} you know, the bigger grocery stores.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 that, you know, which, 
0 B:  I don't think I even know what a lentil is.
0 A:  Yeah, see that, lot of people don't and that's,
0 B:  I've heard, I've heard of a lentil.
0 A:  Yeah, like lentil soup or something.
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  People don't and that's such a good source of protein, or like soybeans,
0 you know, people think, ugh, they think it's something really horrible but
0 there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to
0 it's just a matter of learning, #you had to know.#
0 B:  #You had to learn,# I was going to say you have to learn a whole new way to
0 cook.
0 A:  Yeah.  So, but it,
0 B:  Oh, no way.  But I bet it's really, I bet it is healthy because a couple
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  just because I just, wa-, you know, oh, no particular reason, I just didn't
0 feel like eating meat and, uh, I think even after two days I felt different.
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, think of it, i-, think of it like this, takes a long time for
0 meat to digest and, you know, if you've got that sitting in your stomach, I
0 mean, even when you sleep it's still sitting there digesting.  So, you, you
0 hard to digest all that meat,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  you know, because it takes longer than some products, some other foods in
0 your stomach to digest that meat.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  So, when you prepare a meal, like say on Thanksgiving, what do you?
0 different casseroles and things.  So,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Everything but the turkey.
1 A:  No.  Yeah.  You just, you just.  Well,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  see at ours, uh, we're living with my family, my folks now, so, you know,
0 you know, everyone's life.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  But, um, I think if in our own house we didn't, we would have things like a
0 casserole, things like that, that centered more on the vegetables, as far as,
0 we might have one special dish, one special casserole that was our one special
0 thing, like the turkey,
0 B:  [Noise].
0 it's for me ethical, we'd just play up the fact that Thanksgiving's, you know,
1 is a time for everyone to give thanks [laughter] even turkey, you know.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  that's true.
0 mother is the one that cooks.  Um, which,
0 B:  Well, do they have special cookbooks out for, for just vegetarian meals,
0 you know, special books that you,
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lots of them.  Lots of them and, uh, I have this one in
0 front of me right now, as a matter of fact, it's called SUNDAYS AT THE 
0 MOOSEWOOD RESTAURANT, and, uh, it's out of New York, it's a pretty famous
0 restaurant out of New York, and almost every single recipe in there is, um,
0 vegetarian.  There are some fish recipes, I think, in it but a few of those
0 but not anything,
0 B:  But you don't eat fish either, do you?
0 A:  No, we don't eat fish either.  But it, the majority of the book is, um,
0 vegetarian with no meats, so, or, you know, of any, any kind of animal. So,
0 B:  I have a,
0 A:  there's quite a few out there.
0 B:  I have a hard time with vegetables.  I, I, when I was a kid I didn't like
0 them very much and I never really learned how to cook them right, I guess.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I don't know.  Um, I'll eat a little bit of broccoli and I'll steam it and
0 I like carrots, just certain things, you know, but, uh, I'm not really good
0 with them and I'll go sometimes and not even fix them, I mean, I'll have
0 everything else and no vegetable.  That's strange isn't it?
0 A:  Yeah.  It's strange because, well, it, it's not strange because I use to be
0 the same way and I'm, even to this day, you know, some vegetables really turn
0 B:  [Noise].
0 A:  information that says this is a healthier way to go, you know, and this
0 is what your body wants, this is what your body really needs, and when you
0 think about what, what's the real reason your eating.  I know, I know it's for
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  But, but r-, the main reason is for fuel, you know, and, and, y-, when 
0 you read so much information that tells you that meats and different animal
0 products, you know, are causing, uh, can cause, uh, different kinds of
0 diseases, you know, lo-, like h-, heart diseases and different diabetes and
0 things like that, different kinds of diseases, it's like, uh, is it really
0 States just don't eat enough vegetables, you know, because you can talk grain
0 all you want as far as, you know, cleaning your system out so to speak, but
0 you can't beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and, and
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  because your body doesn't, doesn't syn-, synthesis in the same way that
0 it does when it gets it in raw food, you know,
0 B:  But now if you cook them wrong you can loose the vitamins. 
0 A:  Yeah, that's true, that's true.  So, you, it's, it's all important, you
0 B:  And I'm terribly overweight.  I'm obese, probably is the word, I've never
0 give up the meat products and just get on vegetables I would probably look a
0 lot better.
0 A:  I think you'd feel probably a lot healthier.  Um, my, almost everyone in my
0 family is, is obese.
0 B:  {Speaker B speaks to someone else in the room}.
0 A:  Yeah, I, I would say, you know, th-, almost everyone.  And, uh, exc-,
0 [talking] except me, except myself and, you know, my husband, but, um, and,
0 improvements since we've been here as far as them switching to meat. {Speaker
0 B:  And, uh, for me that's mostly newspaper and radio, I almost never watch
0 television, as a matter of course so, I don't get news from television, except
0 during the war,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Well, why was C N N the only, of course I think, Saddam Hussein only
0 allowed C N N to broadcast it, is that not true?
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  It was unusual not to have the different sources, you know, of news
0 coverage.
0 B:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know. I guess, uh, I don't even know why I watched C N
0 N.  I guess, I just wanted more news.  It's one of the few times I wanted more
0 news than.
0 A:  Yeah, well, I know even if you watched A B C, N B C or the other, I mean,
0 what's the other one, uh, #C B S.#
0 B:  #C B S.#
0 B:  Were they?   
0 A:  Uh-uh. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  That's the only thing they broadcast and like you I listened to radio on my
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 is why, uh, why C N N was well, I listen to a Christian radio station.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And they were saying that C N N is definitely a world, uh, news service
0 A:  Uh, we had some, uh, some people from our church went to Israel, uh, just
0 for a, uh, tour sort of thing.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  And I was watching on T V they, they broadcast this terrible riot
0 supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem, so we got all fearful for our
0 people, come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of
0 it,
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  and so it really made me question as to what, how do we know, you know,
0 uh, if the news we're getting is any good. So [laughter], 
0 B:  Yeah, I guess, the news just focuses on major events that probably,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  don't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when
0 B:  But, uh, I, I'm from California and I can remember being in, uh, in these
0 earthquakes and, I mean they were,
0 B:  they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view, and it
0 seemed, you know, from anyone else's point of view, but they get all blown up
0 in the news.  Um,
0 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].  Well I, I find it depressing to watch our, specially T
0 like that.  I'm from Dallas and, uh, we have a lot of bad stuff, uh, it just
0 really gets me depressed,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  even to watch it. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 
0 A:  So then, you wake up one morning and you are in war with somebody you don't
0 even, [laughter] even know about it.
0 A:  So. 
0 B:  Well, what newspapers, uh, do you read in Dallas? 
0 A:  Uh, we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS, but I
0 B:  Don't you?
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  How come? 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  I find it hard to, uh, follow from one page to another.  It's just
0 something I have never developed, uh, an interest in.
0 B:  Huh. 
0 stolen before I can get out and get it [laughter].
0 A:  You would be surprised. 
0 B:  Huh?
0 A:  They just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the T V, you know
0 t-, uh, selections of the day.
0 B:  I see. 
0 A:  I don't know. It just wouldn't be there whenever I tried it. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  So, you're right, who would steal a newspaper?  {Ice in glass sound in
0 background} But, they do.
0 now, that's where I am speaking to you from.
0 A:  Oh, okay. 
0 B:  But, I grew up in L A. I work out here. 
0 A:  Huh, you work for T I?  
0 B:  No, I don't.  I work for North Carolina State University. 
0 A:  Huh. 
0 B:  But, uh, I know some people at T I, and I have a couple of students who
0 have graduated and gone to work for them.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  So, I'm in the computer business. 
0 B:  Well. 
0 A:  I don't keep up with it that often. 
0 @@B:  Let's see, I've, I've, I've never done this before, I mean I've never.
0 A:  This is your first call? 
1 B:  This is my first call.
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Because I just got my password.
0 A:  Oh, really. Yeah. 
0 to talk for three minutes, but I think we've been talking for three minutes
0 and nobody has interrupted.
0 A:  Yeah, well I, I got into a conversation last night with a lady and they
0 interrupt at ten,
0 B:  I see.
0 A:  minutes.  So if we've done our three minutes.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Let's just let the conversation end and say bye.
0 B:  Well, all right.  Nice talking to you.  
0 A:  Nice talking to you too. 
0 B:  All right, bye. 
0 B:  Hello.
0 B:  Not bad, not bad.  What's your name?
0 A:  Fernando.
0 B:  Fernando.  My name is Nick.
0 A:  Wait.  Let me turn off my stereo here [/music].
0 connected to somebody.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Phew {almost like a whistling sound}.  #Man, I'm,# 
0 A:  #Yeah.#  What time is it over th-, are you, are you in Dallas?
0 A:  Are you?
0 B:  Yeah.  #((I)).#
0 A:  #Because# every time I got through, I went to Dallas, Texas.  
0 B:  Really?
0 B:  Oh.  Well, you're on the, uh, let's see,
0 A:  On the other coast [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, twenty-one {sounds like he is talking to someone other than speaker}.
0 Yeah.  Shoot man, it's, what, midnight almost?
0 A:  What?  Yeah, yeah.  It's, uh, I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here.
0 what about credit #card?#
0 A:  #W-,# wait.  Wh-, what did, how, how did you get to know about the T I
0 B:  Oh, one of my instructors, uh, said that they were doing something like
0 B:  A, a Masters in, uh, information systems.
0 A:  Really.  I'm doing my Masters in, in computer science and computer
0 B:  Yeah?  Where at?
0 A:  At North Carolina State University.
0 B:  Hey.  How do you like it out there [clicking]?
0 A:  Uh, I don't.  Because, uh, I come from a lot, a bigger city than this one
0 and --
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 A:  -- #I, I'm# in Raleigh #and,# 
0 B:  #Oh.#  Raleigh Durham.  Yeah.
0 built around universities.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Like Chapel Hill?
0 little towns #but they# --
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 A:  Where you at?
0 B:  Uh, well, I'm in Monterey, California right now [barking].  Yeah.
0 hundred and fifty thousand people and that's about it.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 just south of, uh, San Jose and San Francisco.
0 A:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  And it's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a, you know, to a
0 large city.
0 A:  So, so where do you go?  Do you go to Berkeley?
0 B:  No, no.  I go to the, it's the naval postgraduate school out here.
0 A:  Oh, okay.  Because, uh, I was looking at, at the,
0 B:  [Cough].
0 A:  doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley [sigh].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 #something# --
0 B:  #[Thumping] Uh-huh.#
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 A:  And it's like,
0 B:  Well, that's what they look for.  Whether or not they get it is hard to say
0 [noise] {sounds like a chair is drug across the floor}.
0 it was like --
0 B:  Yeah [talking].
0 and,
0 B:  [Talking].
0 A:  ninety-nine percentile on the, on the #verbal part.#
0 B:  #Yeah.  It's# pretty tough.  It's pretty tough [/talking].  I, uh, let's
0 face it, you know.  And, you know, I, you know, did the, you know, as far as,
0 I found it a lot of times with, regards to education, you know, the school
0 only takes you so far, you know.  It's what you do.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  You know.  So, uh, I don't lose any sleep, sleep over stuff like that.  
0 B:  Probably not.  See I'm in the Navy.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And, uh, you know, most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until
0 I, if I do do it, it will be after I get out of the Navy.
0 A:  When do you get out?
0 B:  Oh, probably be another twelve years.
0 A:  Oh, okay [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, you know I like what #I'm doing right now.#
0 A:  [Swallowing] What if they pay for?
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Nah, they won't pay for it.  They've, I think they have maybe two people a
0 A:  #Because# I know, I know a couple of people here that work for, uh,
0 [inhaling] the Army.  #Uh,# 
0 B:  #Yeah.#  They civilians or, uh, military?
0 A:  I think, I think they're military.  #But, I# --
0 A:  -- mean, the guy is still in.
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  #And,# uh, h-, uh, he works over in Maryland [swallowing].  
0 A:  And so he's doing his Masters here.  They gave him like a scholarship like
0 for a year.
0 A:  #And# he's doing it in like, in a year and a summer.  
0 A:  And so he's getting that and, uh --
0 A:  -- they said like they got a lot of benefits and that.  That's why you want
0 to join.
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  #But, uh,# this guy, I mean you can earn a lot more money so you say, I go
0 why you still there if you can earn a lot more money, once you've get your,
0 your, your Masters.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  They go, well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so.
0 B:  Well, a lot of times it's, you know, a lot of times it's not the money
0 [barking] that keeps pe-, that keeps people #((in)).#
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  They, they like what they're doing.  They, you know, they feel good about
0 what they're doing.  #That type of thing.  It's more [popping],# 
0 A:  #But I mean, I mean, you, the,# once you get your Masters, you can be
0 earning between, anywhere between like thirty-seven, forty-five thousand a
0 year.
0 A:  And --
0 A:  -- #and that's# not what they're paying.
0 B:  No.  Well, it depends on what rank you are, #of course [/barking].# 
0 A:  #Yeah.#  Yeah, I know [laughter].
0 B:  I mean, like I say, if you're, if you're, you know, if you're at an upper
0 level in the rank category, you know, you're probably pulling down close to
0 seventy grand a year.
0 B:  Yeah.  Those are few and far between #though.#
0 A:  #Yeah.#  #It's like,#
0 B:  #[Laughter].#
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- and, uh, everyone's a manager.  But nobody can get one more point to
0 B:  #Yeah.  Since# I imagine it's fairly #competitive.#
0 A:  #Yeah.# It's like, no I, I mean, I B M is like, there's a joke about I B M
0 which says, you know, it's like, uh, all, all the major companies get into a,
0 a boating race, right?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh [noise].
0 A:  And then they come in last and they have this whole team, you know,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 row, row, row and one person rowing, right.
0 B:  #[Laughter].#
0 solution?  They go, yeah, change the rower #[laughter].  You know, it's like
0 everyone's a,#
0 B:  #[Laughter].#
0 A:  manager but, you know, #it's like# --
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 A:  -- only use like one person does the work so.
0 B:  Too many chiefs and #not enough Indians.#
0 A:  #Yeah. So.#
0 B:  Yeah.  I don't know, that can be, that, that can really slow you down.  
0 having problems.  I mean, everyone's a manager and,
0 A:  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, it's like the people that actually do the work
0 there --
0 It's like, #it's like have you, have# --
0 B:  #(( )) push paper around.#
0 A:  -- have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the,
0 with, uh, the think tank?
0 A:  You know, like all these people are just standing, sitting around, just
0 B:  [Cough].
0 A:  No.  And then this guy from Federal, Federal Express comes along.  They go
0 you where your package is anywhere, any time.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And so it's like the same thing with I B M.  You know, so they have this
0 think tank.  And they got to come up with ideas.  But, see, uh, the, the thing
0 is, that I B M is so stabilized that #everybody will buy their stuff.#
0 B:  #[Popping] Yeah.# Oh, yeah.  They've got a, they've got basically a, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  And a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they
0 provide, you know, people generally go with that because they figure that the,
0 you know, you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material.  Where's if
0 you try something different, they'll --
0 A:  And it fails and #you're dead.#
0 B:  -- #they'll say# yeah, why didn't you buy, #why didn't you try something
0 more mainline.#
0 A:  #Yeah.  Well I B M# doesn't fire anybody.  #Because# --
0 B:  #[Throat_clearing] No.#
0 A:  -- uh, what they do is they, they put you in a different job.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 quit.
0 A:  I mean that's their policy.  They never fire anybody unless you're caught
0 B:  Illegal or something #like that, yeah.#
0 [swallowing].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 know, like you're a manager.  So they'll #put# --
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  -- you into keeping up the paper, you know.  It's like how much paper is
0 going in?  And then #you# --
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
0 A:  -- say that's not my job, so you quit.
0 B:  So, in other words, that's the way they #force# --
0 A:  #Right.#
0 B:  -- people out [cough].  That's why they can say, you know, there's #no
0 layoff# --
0 A:  #Right.#
0 you're always going to have great #career# --
0 A:  #Right.#
0 B:  -- conditions.  He-, hey, that's kind #of sad.#  
0 A:  #No, but# I mean, it's like, it's like they, they have just like different
0 in their commercials, they never put down any other company, you know.  It's
0 like --
0 B:  No.
0 A:  -- they won't say,
0 B:  Well, they're the standard right now.  Or as far as that goes, you know,
0 people think of computers, they think of I B M a lot of times.  And the 
0 main,
0 A:  Yeah.  Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy.
0 B:  [Cough].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And so that's what you're going to go for.  
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, you know, that's, that's a, that's a big #thing.#
0 A:  #And,# and, you know, it's like, for example, like Leading Edge.  Have you
0 ever heard of Leading Edge?
0 B:  Yeah.  They are out of Korea right.
0 B:  Leading Edge.  Don't they pro-, 
0 A:  They, they made like, uh, small personal computers.
0 B:  Yeah.  Small P C -s.  (( )) they're out of Korea right?
0 A:  I don't know.  I don't know.  But what they do is, what they did, I don't
0 know, is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away.
0 A:  #Yeah.#  
0 B:  [Cough].
0 A:  (( )) for example, you test a chip.  It can't last seven years but it can
0 last five.  I B M says let's throw it away.  Leading Edge will say we'll buy
0 it from you.
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  And so that's, I mean, they're still around I think.
0 B:  Yeah.  I've seen, well I've seen them around #anyway. You know (( )).#
0 A:  #[Clicking] [swallowing] So, that's what they do.# They buy all, all the
0 things that I B M throws away and they (( )), and that's why they're so
0 compatible.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  #Most people do.#  Or they have to anyway.
0 A:  Well, I mean, there's like, well in a way you realize, I mean, one t-, one
0 of my teachers got this computer which, you know, it's like, uh, voice, uh,
0 synthesizing stuff.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And he got that.  He said, you know, it's like, uh, [swallowing] I was
0 testing it and it was wonderful.  And then when you tried to erase and
0 B:  #Wow.#
0 A:  #And I want more,# you know.  And it's like Jesus Christ, you know, it's
0 you put into Wave --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- and you want to correct the errors into Wave, it takes so much, I mean,
0 it's like, of course it does.  I mean, by the times it transforms into Wave by
0 mark off model and you put it in there, and you want to correct those.  And
0 then, you know, you're trying to make the, the Wave smooth so you can
0 approximately, of course it's going to take a lot.  #Imagine, imagine# --
0 A:  -- what it is for us to make mark off models, you know.  It's like,
0 B:  Well, when you get, you know, when you get right down to it, the, uh, the
0 more they can do for you, the more, uh, like I say, the more, the more memory
0 they're going to #require.#
0 A:  #Yeah.#  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.  Both, both in terms in Ram as well as, uh, you know, #standard# --
0 B:  -- memory or disk mem-, #disk base, so.#
0 A:  #Well, like# they say, like nobody can get enough, you know.  It's like
0 once you have #something, ((and it's like))# --
0 B:  #Oh, yeah.  You find out more,# 
0 A:  -- I was watching this program on T V yesterday.  In nineteen 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- NASA came up with Three D graphics.  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And they were showing this like Three D g-, Three D graphics view of 
0 like,
0 B:  Like the (( )) deal?
0 A:  What?  #No, no, no.#
0 B:  #Like a hologram?#
0 B:  #With just graphics on, on a,# 
0 B:  #Okay [cough].#
0 A:  But the only thing was, that it was just lines, okay.  Like if you
0 B:  Well, personally, you know, I think, you know, of course I'm sure we're
0 familiar with the exact same benefit package and I think that, uh, we've
0 probably got one of the best around, you know, besides, they tend to offer
0 ad-, adequate vacation, I guess.  And the paid time off is wonderful, and, uh,
0 one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this
0 week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered and I think that is just a, a
0 fabulous one, so.  I don't know if you participate in that or not, but --
0 A:  Absolutely. 
0 B:  -- isn't it great?  [laughter] It's just a, it's just a miracle that how
0 B:  Uh-huh
0 A:  -- while I was waiting for, uh, the system to find a, a respondent.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and
0 I suspect that that's probably true for everyone.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  When I was much younger it was, uh, less important to consider retirement
0 and less important to consider medical benefits.  But as I grow older and my
0 family grows, it, the medical benefits are more important and the retirement
0 is more important.
0 B:  I had never really thought of it that way but I guess that's true, I
0 important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and, and that
0 kind of thing.  But, uh, you know, I was just, as a matter of fact, I just,
0 started looking through the, the book because of that, you know, now that I'm
0 a hundred percent vested, you know, you kind of look through the book and see
0 well, what exactly, what does that mean and what is the pension all about and,
0 twenties now, so you tend not to think about retirement.  But, uh, it's, I
0 guess now is the time to think about it, so.  Does T I have a pretty good
0 A:  I think they have, uh, a-, one that we need to recognize that we're going
0 to have to supplement ourselves.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun
0 the, uh, CODA Plan.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  It's --
0 A:  -- certainly a, a supplemental way, uh, and I suppose if, b-, maybe in, in
0 your instance, if, if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties,
0 and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very
0 good retirement plan.
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  So it's not, uh, all by itself it won't be adequate for,
0 B:  It's not going to build up,
0 A:  for my situation. 
0 B:  quite enough, yeah. 
0 A:  So, I have to find a way to supplement that. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, they just, they seem to make it so easy to save.  You know,
0 the world, but I've got money coming out (( )) to buy savings bonds, just
0 coming straight out of my check.  And it's probably not a great investment,
0 but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know.
0 I kind of have to trade off, you know.  If you never see it you don't spend
0 A:  Uh, believe me, I do that myself. 
0 B:  Do you?  Yeah?  
0 B:  Do you really not?  
0 A:  in the world.
0 B:  I, I, fr-, you know, I, I debate about whether it's really good or not,
0 you know.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  until later. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Uh, it's shown a history that, uh, sure beats anything else. 
0 B:  Yeah, that's true.  That's very true. 
0 A:  Over many, many years. 
0 B:  We went, uh, and did a, a thing through I B S which is a, like a financial
0 consultant [noise] type thing here in Dallas and, uh, one of the things that
0 we talked about with the counselor there was, [/noise] you know, they work up
0 that you need to work on and you need to do.  And then one of the things that
0 education.  We have a two year old, you know, and, and, you know, we can't
0 start saving for college when he's sixteen, you know, we have to do that now.
0 And, and uh, they have a way that they can figure, you know, what, you know,
0 and he's two now, in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college, this is
0 how much it'll cost, you know, and it's just really scary the thought of how
0 much it's going to, it's, what it costs now is ridiculous, what it's going to
0 cost sixteen years from now is just really scary.  And they sat down and
0 dollars a year at a, oh, you know, six percent interest rate, to be able to
0 have, you know, money for his college.  And that's exactly what we have coming
0 out in saving bonds, is, is, you know, about fifteen hundred dollars a year.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  that approach.  That's,
0 B:  Yeah,
0 A:  what, that's exactly what's happening in my family. 
0 B:  Is it really?  Yeah. 
0 A:  Un-, except that mine are a little bit older and, and I've shown them the
0 numbers and said this is what's going to be available, all this is going to do
0 is give you a little spending money while you're there.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  You better make sure that you've got a scholarship. 
1 B:  That's right.   
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  That's right.  Well, that's what she said to us.  She said, now, do you
0 all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?  And, and our
0 answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to
0 attend a state college.  And if he wants to go to a private college, he can
0 get a scholarship to attend, you know.  And that was kind of our view on it.
0 It just costs too much, you just can't do it, you know.  So, I don't know,
0 it's, it's, I don't, uh, it just amazing, it amazes me how much the, the costs
0 are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years.  I just don't know how
0 anybody's going to do it.
0 A:  I know.  And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them.  Uh,
0 I have a, an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be
0 an allergist,
0 B:  Oh, goodness. 
0 A:  and I said, that's wonderful.  I applaud that.  Let,
0 A:  me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Exactly. 
0 A:  And,
0 B:  Exactly. 
0 A:  then her little brother's only two years behind and he says, well, I
0 don't know, I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.  And I said,
0 that's great.  Let me explain to you how you get scholarships [laughter],
0 B:  That's right,
0 A:  to do that. 
0 B:  That's right [laughter].  Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some
0 good stuff and then I think there's, I mean I think there's some negatives,
0 but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you
0 go.  I have, you know, all, this is the first really large company I've worked
0 for.  I've always been involved in little small, you know, ind-, privately
0 owned s-, owned firms and so I've never had the, the big benefit package.  So,
0 when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to
0 what, what they offered.  So, I've been real pleased.
0 A:  Well, that's fantastic,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  and on whole o-, I would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our
0 competitors.
0 B:  Think so? 
0 not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier.
0 but,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  but here's the amount, that, that T I is going to pay for it,
0 B:  Yeah, and you can pick what you want and, yeah. 
0 A:  now it's up to you it's menu selection, so,
0 B:  Right. 
0 B:  That sounds really good.  I read a thing, I don't even remember if it was
0 they said that T I was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days.  Which
0 I thought sounded like a good idea.  You know, if you've been there, you know,
0 enough and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of
0 vacation by saying, okay, I'm going to want an extra five days this year and
0 they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know, and they're
0 deducting it all along, so you, you can have an extra five days off and be
0 paid for them at the time, you know, you're really not being paid for them,
0 little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know.  So, that is kind of an
0 idea that, that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested
0 in and T I said that they were looking into something like that so,
0 A:  Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a, a
0 standardized compensatory time --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  -- for overtime. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation
0 days,
0 B:  Well,
0 A:  if they did,
0 B:  true.
0 A:  that. 
0 B:  True. 
0 A:  Uh, and, and I would certainly support something like four to one or
0 five to one or, or, you know, maybe they want to get generous and make it
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh, a-, as a repayment for,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  every three to five days that I work overtime there,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  they should give me one day. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  But it should be a standard and, and not left up to either the whim or the
0 current overhead rate t-, uh, that's running in each department.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well, and, yeah, and, and a lot of that is left up to whoever your
0 supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that
0 person and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the
0 next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know.  But
0 that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there.  It seems
0 going to get and what you're not going to get so,
0 that's,
0 A:  Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Well, yes, of course, we do have capital punishment.  And we've, you 
0 know, done away with our, quote, fair share number.
0 A:  Oh, that's right, I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the
0 paper.
0 B:  Yes. 
0 A:  Um, you know, different things, is it restricted to certain crimes?  Or
0 just,
0 B:  Yes, it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  this sort of thing. 
0 B:  It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get 
0 into the system.
0 A:  Yes, I know, the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I
0 there, [throat_clearing] are going to be killed.  Um, there's people that 
0 come to the prisons and they're very violent and, they want, I mean they're 
0 anxious for someone to be killed [child]. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yes.  
0 A:  I just, I can't see that. 
0 B:  That happens on occasion, it sure does, 
0 A:  [Throat_clearing].
0 B:  maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  has affected you personally.  You know, I don't know, or a person
0 personally.
0 A:  No.
0 B:  I think I would be, you know, I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I
0 guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death
0 penalty, I don't know that it's a big deterrent really.  I don't know that it
0 is.  I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or
0 not.
0 B:  Oh, yeah, oh, absolutely, yeah, it goes on for years and years, and costs
0 hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.
0 A:  Ye-, it's really sad. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  I don't know, I just think, um, somehow I hoped that as a people we could
0 be better than, than, um, expecting,
0 B:  Yes.
0 be killed, you know.
0 B:  Yes, uh-huh.
0 A:  Is really kind of bad [child].   
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know,
0 one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.
0 Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might
0 A:  That's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and,
0 B:  Oh, absolutely. 
0 A:  repeat, (( )) and never have any chance for,
0 B:  Tha-, that's right.
0 A:  (( )) Oh, I don't know, is it, do you feel at all like, it's a religious
0 issue?
0 B:  Not with me personally.  It is with a lot of other people. 
0 A:  [Throat_clearing] Uh-huh. 
0 B:  No.
0 A:  I don't know, sometimes I feel, I mean I do go to church and things.  I
0 don't know how I would feel about it.  But like you say, if it hit you
0 B:  Yes.
0 A:  feel differently. 
0 B:  That's a, it's a tough, tough question, it really is.
0 A:  Do you think most states have that or? [child].
0 B:  Yes, I think most states do have capital punishment.  Yes.
0 A:  Uh-huh, huh.  
0 B:  But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.
0 A:  That still does it, that's right.
0 B:  Yes, they're only, I was reading something about it the other day, I
0 (( ))think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have
0 capital punishment still.
0 B:  A lot of them had to have el-, elected not to do so.  Now I don't know,
0 what they do in place of it.  You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you
0 know, something, I don-, I don't know how they handle it bu-, I was
0 surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.
0 A:  Have that. Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, uh, are really,
0 I mean, there's a lot of people that are on death row.
0 B:  Oh, yes. 
0 A:  But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.
0 B:  Yes, a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  So, it seems like a of people live there, and then through 
0 appeals.
0 A:  Because I know they do frequently, I mean they cover, cover it pretty
0 heavily on television and the newspaper.
0 B:  Uh-huh. Yes. 
0 A:  If it finally gets to that point. 
0 B:  Right, the first appeal is automatic, so that delays it for a few years
0 just right off the bat.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  have to go through the whole thing.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  So is it, uh, are we doing lethal injection now?
0 B:  Yes, uh-huh.  That's, that's fairly recent, I don't know, how recent, but
0 fairly recent, in the state of Texas.  Before that, it was, uh, death by
0 electrocution.
0 A:  Uh-huh, wh-, which seems so awful. 
0 B:  Yes, it certainly does. 
0 B:  Yes, it would almost have to be, I suppose.  If you, if you had to chose, 
1 I guess I would, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yes, the other one just seems so terrible.  
0 A:  Um.
0 or no, I would say, you know, yes.  I, I would have to lean toward capital
0 punishment, you know, for certain crimes.
0 A:  Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or, it's
0 not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison?
0 B:  No, I don't think it's a monetary thing. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  I think, we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of determ-, deterrent
0 or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like
0 that.
0 A:  Um.
0 B:  Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless.  This
0 may seem to be the best way out.  I don't know.
0 B:  Easiest way out maybe.  No, I don't think it's a monetary thing.
0 A:  Um.  Well, um, and I notice that the crime ((rate)) was  up in the 
0 Dallas area [throat_clearing]. It's,
0 B:  Yes, especially the murder rate, its just gone crazy. 
0 A:  It's kind of been scary,
0 B:  Yes. 
0 A:  to think about it and,
0 B:  Absolutely. 
0 A:  And you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that. 
0 A:  You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the,
0 A:  in statistics, 
0 B:  Yes. 
0 A:  hasn't had any crime. 
0 B:  Yes,  so have we been very, very fortunate. 
0 A:  And, so we don't, it's harder to think about the poor people that have 
0 suffered that way.
0 B:  That's right.  Absolutely.
0 A:  And how they would expect, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  how they would hope, I mean you, you hear of people who have, um,
0 committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the
0 same thing again.  
0 B:  Absolutely.
0 A:  And you wonder why they can't just stop it.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  That's right. 
0 A:  So, maybe you would, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.
0 B:  So would I, I fortunately, I have never been in that circumstance, I hope I
0 never am, like, like everybody else.
0 A:  No, [laughter] I know when, um, we just, we moved here, uh, I from the, I
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  just like constantly, it seemed like, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  but fortunately I had small children and I didn't have to go.
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  it's just that, I didn't, I hate having to be in charge of someone
0 else's life.
0 B:  Sure, it's, it's a big responsibility, it really is. 
0 A:  And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case,
0 B:  Yes.
0 B:  So would I. 
0 A:  That would be really awful. 
0 B:  Yes.  Absolutely. 
0 A:  Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, uh, talking to you about this.  
0 Although it has been difficult but, uh.
0 B:  It is, it's a tough subject, it really is. 
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.
0 B:  That's right. 
0 A:  Anyway, well, you have a good day.           
0 B:  Well, thank you, it's nice talking to you.
0 A:  Thank you, bye-bye. 
0 B:  I think it would be a great idea.  I'm not sure about requiring it, you
0 know, of people, because people are going, you know, feeling resentful.  I
0 don't know, but I think it would be a great idea.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Seems like there's so many kids that don't have any [cough] since of, you
0 know, what they want to be or do or, you know, they could learn something and
0 maybe help other people at the same time and we, sure, our country, all
0 A:  Huh-uh.  Would, uh, would you be more in favor of, uh, you know, like a
0 local, uh, my only experience with it, I was in Central America for a while,
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  and, uh, in San Salvador, in El Salvador,
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  For instance, everybody had what they called there social year,
0 A:  that they had to put in and basically it was a, uh, repayment for, for,
0 uh, high school education,
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally.  I
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Type things where we're sending people off shore. 
0 in a new language and ship them, you know, to other countries,
0 in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't
0 A:  I don't, I don't know how the Peace Corps works, I, guess I was of age when
0 the Peace Corps came in,
0 A:  and all that. 
0 B:  I thought seriously about joining at that time, I thought it was a
0 B:  I sent off for stuff on it, but I don't remember that much.  about it.  I
0 know that they trained you in the language and, um,
0 A:  That's what I was wondering about was whether they actually,
0 B:  You actually got paid too, while in the Peace Corps, it wasn't much,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  but I guess, they, you could put some money aside while you were there,
0 your expenses and,
1 B:  Yeah, I think so, yeah, yeah [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all
0 the drugs and violence and sex [laughter] and everything here, and take them
0 to some other country that had different moral values [laughter], like Saudi
0 don't know which end though.
0 B:  Really [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  That's, that's been interesting, though, the kids that have
0 been over, you know, coming back right now, you know.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  You wonder if being exposed to that for a while, what percentage of them
0 would actually say, Hey, that's not a bad way to do it, because from what I
0 just almost, uh, instantly and --
0 B:  Public hanging. 
0 don't have just a whole lot of,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  what we consider street crimes. 
0 B:  Yeah.  I've heard that like in China and stuff, there is virtually no such
0 thing as rape, because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered, you know, on
0 the, you know, street so, 
0 little, anyway, the, uh, uh, the, the public service thing again I, I, I guess,
0 in my own, having had the whole three or four minutes to, you know, give it a
1 great deal of thought, you know,
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 sort of voluntary, but when you do that then it becomes almost, uh, a (( )),
0 or it can be,
0 A:  You know, there have, people will kind of set up their own little club,
0 B:  Yeah, that's true.
0 B:  People that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation, you
0 A:  Yeah.
0 if it was,
0 A:  Yeah, well, if they went AWOL, what are you going to do.
1 A:  Shoot them. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Put them in jail [laughter]. 
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, right. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 civilian conservation corps,
0 B:  Huh-uh.
0 A:  because he was in it.  He thought that was great. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if,
0 it's in their own country.  It would certainly help them to appreciate some of
0 the things that we have here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled
0 that way.  I, I, it would take quite a few people.  I think it might build
0 jobs for people, you know, that were administrating and running and training
0 and coordinating and all that, so maybe that part of it would be helpful too.
0 B:  I don't know. 
0 [laughter],
0 would you have, who, who, who would determine what these people do.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah. 
0 A:  You know, if, uh, you know, if it's run by the individual state.  You know
0 B:  Huh-uh. 
0 A:  and the only opposition to it really was that it was, you know, starting
0 some sort of a military elitist type, you know, special corps of cadre of
0 people and that sort of thing.
0 B:  Huh-uh.  
0 A:  And, uh, when the politics get real confusing,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  you know, in a legal way or something, they could send all the people
0 that somebody had paid somebody to, you know, get supported, or,
0 A:  Yeah.  Well,
0 B:  (( )).
0 up of the group was such and such, you know, they'd have to do that percentage
0 of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and, you know,
0 A:  That kind of thing. 
0 B:  That could be a complicated too, couldn't it. 
0 A:  Oh, yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Suppose, uh, well, you know, they had a group who were construction
0 oriented and they went and they, they built, uh, [laughter] can't think of a
0 good example, a swimming pool, or anything, you know, and one, you can, you
0 can only build it in one place, you know, and know matter where you build it,
0 B:  Yeah.  That's true.  Unfair or something, yeah. 
1 A:  Yeah.  I think, uh, oh, boy [laughter]. 
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  It's one of those things on the surface, you know, it seems like a great
1 it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot.
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  It's, uh, the logistics of the thing that, uh, 
0 B:  Yeah.  Really. 
0 A:  gets you going. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, it seems like there's, there's a lot, you don't hear much on
0 anything good or anything like that, but you know, I'm sure that there are a
0 lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing
0 to help and serve and that kind of thing.  I just, I saw on the news the other
0 night that the, uh, the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the
0 practically a teenager,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  She started some type of, um, national organization for youth to
0 volunteer to teach, tutor other kids to read and, you know, do different
0 service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards, you
0 know, helpful things, and I know everyone like in the high schools in Dallas,
0 there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a, um, minority,
0 for the teenagers, instead of, they said, all these gangs kids could join to
0 belong.
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  But they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing, helping,
0 you know,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  so they were trying to start that out, so if there's people out there
0 that are willing to, you know, kids that are willing to sacrifice their time
0 and energy.  Gosh, we ought to use them.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  You know.  If their willing to do it. 
0 A:  Yeah, it's, it's , it's just the, you know, here you are to the logistics
0 of the thing again, you know.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Who's going to run it, you know, what, how, oh, it's just so many --
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  -- Like, like I said at the beginning I've got so many connections with
0 people in Central America.  My daughter-in-law is Panamanian, you know,
0 A:  and they have situations like, like that down there.
0 B:  Huh-uh.
0 A:  Where they, they have, these, the social, in some sort of way, if you
0 want to go to school outside the country, and many Salvadorians did, they'd go
0 A:  and when they came back, they'd have to serve this, this year, and it
0 Red Cross, because they didn't do anything --
0 A:  -- And they had all kinds of, uh, things they could go into, agricultural,
0 and you know,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 something like that, Red Cross, it was so many of them in it, that at any
0 particular chance, your chance of having to do something was, it was very
0 slim.
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
0 A:  And so,
0 B:  Well, we, um, belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,
0 A:  Huh-uh.  Huh-uh.
0 B:  And, um, there, there is men and also women, women aren't nearly as
0 frequent, and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left, that
0 can volunteer to go on a mission and, um, they're all over the world.  And,
0 its incredible logistics, I mean, they have a training center where they teach
0 them, it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah, and they have,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things, and
0 then they, um, you know, go and actually live in that country for the, the,
0 uh, young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months.
0 A:  Okay.  Then that's, uh, kind of a private organization,
0 A:  you know, I'm, I'm familiar with, my instructor pilot was a Mormon, he
0 was, he was a good construction, uh, you know, in-, instructor pilot because
0 he considered himself indestructible,
1 B:  Oh, yeah [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  He had a direct connection somewhere, uh [laughter],  
0 A:  Yeah, right [laughter].  He felt that he really had an in so,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  You know, things he would do with an airplane, but any rate that's off the
0 subject,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  But, I,
0 B:  They, they don't get paid for it, and, um, but there is funding that comes,
0 they're supposedly saving up on their own and the church helps them out some,
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  but, you know, that it is incredible, you know.
0 A:  I see how they were organized in,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Central and South America and, uh,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  [Laughter]  What are you afraid of with them? 
0 B:  What am I afraid of? 
0 B:  Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much.  I just, uh,
1 don't think that I need them, you know.  I, uh, they are tempting at times,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  but I, I just, you know, sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing
0 everything about me, you know, so,
0 A:  Well, that's very, can be very, very true. 
0 B:  So, and th-, you know, everybody just gives you a credit card just so
0 you'll spend money so,
0 A:  Well, that's the idea.  They figure that,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  if they give you card,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  That's right.  See they make money off of it, whether you use it or not.
0 B:  [Child].
0 A:  you will not pay your bill at the end of the month,
0 B:  #That's right.#
0 A:  #so that you# would be paying interest. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  I use mine a great deal, um, for groceries, for everything that I can and,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  then just write one check at the end of the month, 
0 B:  #That's what I do.#    
0 A:  #for the entire thing,# right. 
0 B:  That's what I do.  Just a second. {Talking to child in background}.
0 B:  I have two little ones.  Yes. 
0 B:  Yeah. So tha-,
0 B:  (( )) um, four and two and half. 
1 A:  Oh, boy.  Those are two very active ages [laughter].
0 credit card for, um, you know, when I, you know, I just use it whenever I feel
0 I can't payoff at the end of the month.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  So,
0 A:  Well, uh, do you, uh, do you ever use the A T M machines? 
0 take the checkbook so I, you know, I, just, if I need cash, I just tell him
1 and he gets it out and I don't even think I know my number [laughter].
0 have to continue to write checks,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  That's right.  See we, he couldn't do without it, h-, but, you know, since
0 he can just do it right there at work,
0 B:  #for nothing#.
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use
0 their A, their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  -- and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very
0 A:  Yeah right.  Absolutely. 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Because they, 
0 B:  Your defeating the purpose.
0 B:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  The idea is to use their money [laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah. 
0 A:  And, uh, during that whole month and,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  then pay it at the end of the month.  
0 B:  Yeah, I mean, I get, I get at least one or two a week. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  People, t-, you know, sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone
0 and I just say I don't want it.
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  Because I,
0 mean no and,
0 B:  #Yeah.  It's like,#
0 A:  #not be tempted.#
0 B:  I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that
0 they can go and say, you get this much credit line.  You know.
0 A:  Well, i-,
0 B:  You've already been preapproved.
0 A:  oh, absolutely, preapproved.  That's their favorite word. 
1 B:  Yes.  Everybody in the country is preapproved, I think. 
0 A:  [Laughter] I think so, you're right. 
0 B:  So, 
0 A:  Well, it's interesting, uh, that, uh, 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  people have the, generally the same view.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  of credit cards,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  no matter where you go. 
0 B:  And, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you
0 know, one day they find, wow, I didn't realize I had this much,
0 B:  you know, I'd spent this much money. 
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  And, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it. 
0 A:  Well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card
0 they own,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  and, I mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem.
0 B:  Yeah, it does because you're, you know, you, you're, you know, you're just
0 co-, costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly,
0 the minimum payment, you're paying interest,
0 A:  That's right. 
0 B:  again so,  
0 A:  That's right.
0 B:  Yeah so,
0 @@A:  Well it's been enjoyable talking with you. 
0 B:  Yeah.  It's enjoyable talking with, seeing that somebody feels the
0 same way, so, well,
0 A:  Right.  Well take good care.  Take care of your little ones.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 background noise}.
0 B:  Well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking about that the other day, and,
0 uh, I really don't know the answer, [laughter], uh, I would sort of like to,
0 uh, think about something in the way of, uh, uh,  sort of a sporty car but 
0 not any, not, you know, a luxury type sporty one.
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 gadgets and things.
0 A:  Oh, you do want a lot of that stuff?
0 B:  Yeah, well, yeah I like, I like some of those things.  They come in really
0 handy {clicking sounds in background}.
0 A:  What kind of, uh, things are you going to consider, you know, what, uh, you
0 said something about the, about the, well, what do you call them, you said
0 amenities,
0 B:  Amenities.
0 A:  that they have, but what about, um, their reputation of the company or
0 the price.
0 B:  Yeah, well, of course, I guess, uh,  price is always the big consideration,
0 but, 
0 B:  yeah.
1 A:  don't seem to have the same problem [laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter]  Well, that's, that's a big one in my book,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  but, uh, um, I have preferences for, uh, for some, uh, makers over 
0 others, um, and I would sort of like to buy American,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 sounds} I wouldn't buy something else, how about you?
0 A:  Well, um, the last car ((we)) bought was American because of, because of
0 that reason, but ((have)) not been entirely happy with, uh, several things
0 about the car, it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected
0 B:  Oh, really?
0 A:  Because several things, minor things sort of, but still they cost us money,
0 um, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that, that
0 was that new,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  you know, we bought the car new and after, um, well, well, well under 
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  And, they just said, well, you know, clutches are ((disposable)), and I
0 said, since when?
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Brake pads are ((disposable)),
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  you know, we know that, but I never thought a clutch was disposable.
0 A:  Yeah, so that was, that was kind of a shock [laughter].
0 B:  Oh.  Yeah, I, I guess there's a lot to, to think about when you're trying 
0 to make that decision.
0 A:  Yeah, you know, the less actually, the less you spend on a car it seems
0 like luxury cars, they're called luxury cars even though they're much more
0 expensive like, like, uh, uh, a Mercedes Benz, they don't have the history of
0 breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be
0 considered disposable.
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes,
0 B:  No but then,
0 A:  especially not after two years.
0 B:  No, but on the other hand, I guess, too, uh, whenever you do have to have
0 A:  Really?  Oh I don't know.
0 B:  Yeah, I've, uh, worked with a couple of people who have owned, uh, various
0 years, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Mercedes and, even though they do a lot of the work themself then just 
0 buying the parts and everything is, is pretty expensive.  But for them it's, 
0 it's sort of a hobby, too,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  to own them (( )).
0 A:  What kind of, what brand of car are you thinking about buying or ((like))
0 what things are you looking at?
0 B:  Well, I haven't re-, really gotten that far with it, um, I've always sort
0 of liked General Motors,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  a little bit better than some of the others but, uh, oh, I guess, I
0 really don't know.
0 A:  How come (( )) I've been kind of, um, I guess the commercials are getting
0 to me, the Toyota commercials,
0 A:  and I know that a lot of people I've, I've known that have had Toyotas
0 have been just extremely happy with them, that hardly had any problems at all.
0 B:  Yeah, that, I think that's,
0 A:  I think they have a really good, uh, quality.
0 the reasons we, um, bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a
0 Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years and he lived
0 way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and, you knew it had, had been through a whole lot,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and yet, you know, it, it held up pretty doggone good, so,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  I thought they would [clicking],
0 A:  They seem to be really durable.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  So, I don't know, I'm, I'm not ready to buy a new car yet, but I don't
0 American or if I'm going to go for a little more, what I would consider to be
0 a long-term investment [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, and I guess, you know, you always have to think about things
0 like, your gas mileage and stuff like that, you know, you ...
0 B:  Yeah {background noise}.
0 A:  it gets excellent gas mileage.
0 B:  Yeah, that's one of the big throwing cards for, some of the foreign 
0 ones {noise like one music note}.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I think so.
0 A:  All righty, thanks {/TV and background noise}.
0 B:  #Bye-bye.#
0 @B:  Well, uh, the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time, are crafts and, uh,
0 I've been involved in making, uh, hat stands and, uh, rag dolls and, uh,
0 of thing, straw hats and,
0 A:  Oh {Sounds like typing noises in background}.
0 B:  all that kind of stuff.  And I enjoy it, it's relaxing.  And you kind of
0 get absorbed in it so the time goes by, you know, before you realize anything
0 satisfaction.  [laughter].  Not for anybody else's ears because I'm not that
0 good at it, but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while.
0 A:  Oh really?
0 B:  How about yourself?
0 A:  Well, oh, hobbies, gee whiz, I guess I got too many hobbies so I never have
0 time to deal with them.
0 B:  Really?
0 A:  I like photography a lot,
0 B:  Oh, yeah, that's neat.
0 A:  uh, I used to do that a lot and then I like, um, we have a new child that
0 will be a year old here next week, so I'll take a lot of pictures of her,
0 B:  Oh, that's great, uh-huh.
0 a lot, I play about every night.  And, um, I really love that, if I had a
0 ((druther)), if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play
0 on like a bluegrass band or something, because that's, I've,
0 B:  Oh, that sounds nice.  I like bluegrass, too.
0 A:  yeah, I've done it before and when I was in hi-, in high school and
0 college,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and thoroughly enjoyed it, and it's really a, a blast.  My wife hates it,
0 B:  [Laughter] That's the hard part, right?
0 A:  Exactly.
0 B:  If you can do things together, that really helps a lot.
0 B:  Oh, that's good, too.
0 A:  and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half and that went
0 over real well,
0 A:  but, uh, that's about it there.
0 B:  Oh, it's good and it's healthy, too.
0 A:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
0 B:  We do that too, we have a, uh, a treadmill and, uh, a bicycle and that kind
0 of stuff, we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a
0 week, you know.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  And we like movies, that ki-, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, that's, uh, spare time, with a child it's, kind of stra-, she's, we
0 have, uh, we're looking for a baby-sitter so we've been out twice in o-, in
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  By ourselves without the child so it's kind of, uh, become an issue you
0 B:  Sure.
0 A:  Um, hobbies, I like, messing around in your house building things, and, you
0 know,
0 B:  Oh yeah, that's great, too.
0 A:  those kind of things, um,
0 B:  Yeah, we did some remodeling when we bought a house, we built, put a
0 kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff, and painting and some wallpapering,
0 A:  It's really kind of fun.
0 A:  Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty, yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, exactly.  I like things that, you know, two people can do, but I like
0 the quiet of doing things away, you know, kind of gives you some space for
0 yourself, and that's what I find in making the dolls and things, that it gives
0 me something that I can create, and I like to crochet and knit.  I made some
0 afghans and that kind of stuff.  I like doing things with my hands.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Sounds like it.
0 A:  Do you like to cook?
0 B:  Yes, I love to cook.
0 A:  Yeah, I love to cook, too, I'm, uh,
0 B:  Italian food [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, really?
1 A:  Well, we're all skinny farts so, I, it,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  so when it comes to, I like to cook and eat and,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  to have, mai-, mainly, I guess, I get to (( )) amount of people eat,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and then say, man this is really good,
0 B:  Yeah, it is.
0 A:  um, um, but it just, work in the garden, work around the yard, of course,
0 B:  Do you do barbecues?
0 A:  Yes, #we sure do, smoke them an-,#
0 B:  #Well, uh, uh, smoking and# all that stuff? 
0 A:  Oh, yeah, all that hoedown stuff. 
0 B:  Yeah, yep, 
0 B:  #I, I lived in Abilene for# a little while,
0 A:  Oh, sure, yeah.  
0 B:  and, uh, worked in the Abilene plant, and we used to go to Joe Allen's
0 A:  That's, uh,  
0 B:  they have some nice stuff down there.  
0 A:  only way to do it. 
0 B:  I miss it [laughter]. 
0 A:  Well, yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, there's, uh, there's pluses to
0 everything,
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  but, you know, seems like there's just so many things to do down here, I
0 like the sports, I play a lot of racquetball.
0 B:  We did, (( )) I did horseback riding, too, in fact, when my children were
0 growing up, we always had horses and, uh, that was kind of for them, but they
0 weren't as interested in it as we were, you know, so, uh, that was a real, I'd
0 say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know, we always
1 had horses around, and I really enjoyed that,
0 them.
0 A:  Horses?  
0 B:  Yes [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah, you really don't.  Yeah, th-, the, you have to look real hard to see
0 a lot of things besides concrete, uh,
0 A:  there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people and that's about it
0 down here, and so,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Yeah.  But, uh, that's great.  Well, sounds like you have a lot of nice
0 hobbies there.
0 B:  Yeah, you too, you too. 
0 A:  Well, great, well look, uh, I know it's probably late for you,
0 B:  Okay.  
0 A:  I enjoyed speaking with you --
0 A:  -- have a good weekend. 
0 B:  Okay. 
0 A:  Bye-bye. 
0 vote because they don't really think their, their, uh, opinion is going to be
0 heard and, you know, there's such a small voice and such a huge number of
0 make that much difference and whether you vote for one person or the other
0 person, the issues is what, you know, what you believe in, and that person is
0 going to have a lot of, uh, since there's so many issues, this one person can
0 B:  Right, yeah.   
0 A:  all of them so, it would be really difficult to have that one pers-,
0 perfect person that believed exactly what you believed.
0 up the people that, uh, vote every time, uh, elections come around are more
0 the, the polly, uh, the party type followers, the guys that, uh, you know,
0 follow the party lines, you know, and,
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  they, you know, just go in and if they're Republican they vo-, vote
0 Republican every year, you know, and, uh, the people that are independent, you
0 know, are the ones that don't, uh, don't really, uh, show up every year
0 because they can't seem to, to decide which are the good aspects and which are
0 A:  Right, yeah, 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  that's good. 
0 B:  Ye-, I always thought it was back when Anderson was running, I was hoping
0 would start going down the tubes, but, um [baby_crying],
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah, there's, uh, a lot of extremes on the parties, too, with the you
0 know, the real, uh, far side of the Democrats they're real liberal now and to
0 where probably fifty or a hundred years ago, um, the Democrat party being
0 liberal like they are now, you know, would never be thought of, it would be
0 uh, moral standings and those kinds of things.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  But,
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, that's, uh, and then, and then people always get upset about
0 it, too, because, you know, every year the, the, the politicians are the
0 ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote,
0 A:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  
0 B:  they, they each think that, uh, if more people vote, they'll get more
0 votes, huh?
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 B:  I'm always amazed at that, that each candidate thinks it's going to be the
0 people that come out that will vote for him, you know.
0 A:  Yeah.  That's, that's true.  I think in, uh, the Texas governor elections,
0 I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody,
0 this time.
0 B:  Yeah, well, that, uh, (( )) I know that there's certain issues that can
0 type area,
0 B:  and when things start, uh, when, when abortion comes on the issues and
0 people just get all insp-, inspired, you know,
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  and, uh, still on the other hand we're also, uh, this particular
0 community is a Catholic community but, uh, uh, down in D C where, where
0 things are a little bit different, uh, you know, it's, it's women's rights and
0 the, and that sort of movement, and so it's, uh, quite the opposite, so
0 elections start getting very, uh, the elections where they have that topic
0 seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones.
0 A:  Yeah, that's true. 
0 A:  Yeah, that's true that the different places in America that, uh, you know,
0 different issues would be a lot more important than ((say in)) another place.
0 B:  [Baby_talking] Yeah, I can understand why, why some of the, the rural
0 areas, the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the
0 lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for the, the Midwest,
0 A:  Uh-huh {very faint}.   
0 B:  and, uh, it doesn't matter who they put in office, they're going to fall
0 A:  Right.  Yeah, and it's, uh, real true that, uh, you know, they'll say one
0 thing,
0 A:  to get elected, and then once they do get elected, they don't have the
0 power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you
0 know, like the no new taxes thing.  You know, that's, uh, with the economy
0 going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous --
0 B:  Yeah [baby_talking].
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next
0 year.  I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected.
0 A:  Right [laughter].  
0 B:  Uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 )) even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot so
0 they won't even bother turning out.
0 A:  Uh, that's true, yeah. 
0 B:  They'll just say, oh, well, you know, the Republicans have this election
0 we'll see you in four years.
0 A:  Right.  Yeah. 
0 B:  (( )) hope some of the local, well that's what they, they keep saying that
0 it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't
0 turning out at the, at the booths, they, they say that these older voters
0 you know, really know what's going on, have the experience and seen, you know,
0 how politicians can, you know, screwup or what ever.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  But, I know, my grandmother hasn't voted in years. 
0 A:  Right, that's, you know, neither has mine as a matter of fact.  And, uh,
0 [barking], that's true, they, I think they look at it as, well everybody,
0 the majority of the people think this way, when that's not necessarily true,
0 B:  [Baby_talking].
0 A:  because, you know, that's what the media says.  Well, the majority believes
0 this way so, uh, they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their,
0 uh, opinions.  So that's, that's true.
0 @@B:  Yeah, wonder if they're going to take into account (( )) this
0 computerized conversation that there's little children, you know, bouncing in
1 your knee,
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  the whole time your talking [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.  Do you hear the dogs in the background here? 
0 B:  No, I can't hear them. 
0 A:  Okay, they're, the children [barking] next door just opened the fence
0 and they went off.
0 B:  Oh, yeah? 
0 A:  Yeah.  But anyway, that's, I guess we've, uh, talked long enough and, uh,
0 B:  Yeah [/Baby_talking].
0 A:  that was sort of interesting.  What part of the country are you from?
0 B:  Uh, Washington, D C,
0 A:  Wow.  This is, I'm in, from, this is Dallas where I'm at. 
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  The outskirts of Dallas.
0 B:  Well, I figured ((with Texas Instruments)) they'd probably have a few,
0 uh, Texans on the line now and then.
0 A:  Yeah, do, do you work for T I in any way? 
0 B:  No, huh-uh. 
0 A:  Wow, how did you, how did they get you? 
0 B:  Um, they (( )), they went through engineering companies,
0 B:  and, uh, we're communications.  I, I work in a communications company.
0 and I thought, wow, that might be interesting.
0 A:  Yeah.     
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  I guess they were doing (( )) Eastern Standard Time.  I was like, I don't
0 A:  [Barking] Yeah, Central Standard Time is what they're doing it by. 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah.  I still haven't figured out what the zero through six days which day
1 is which yet but,
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  I didn't study it that hard so maybe I'll figure it out. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  But, anyway, it was nice to talk to you and, uh, sort of meet you, and,
0 B:  Okay.  
0 A:  that was an interesting topic. 
0 B:  Yeah.  Okay, well, if your ever in, uh, D C, come look up Wayne
0 ((Sherman)), you'll say oh, yeah, talked to that guy.
0 A:  Okay.  I'm, I'm Kyle Hunt,
0 B:  Okay. 
1 A:  We live right by the airport. 
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, yeah, so do we. 
0 A:  Oh, okay. 
0 B:  Yeah, right next to Dulles. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  All right, I'll talk to you later [baby_crying]. 
0 A:  Okay.   
0 B:  Bye-bye. 
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  Well [throat_clearing], what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  I haven't even heard that, that's great.  I think he deserves every penny
0 of it.
0 B:  But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money
0 they're getting.
0 A:  Well, isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players
0 would.
0 A:  Wonder because football,
0 B:  And they play a lot, they play a lot longer season, too.
0 A:  And a lot more games, right?
0 B:  Yeah, that's exactly right.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  But I think, let's see, the teams that were there last year were, {pause}
0 year.
0 A:  Beats me.  I mean, I know Yankees have won a lot games [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].
0 A:  through the years.
0 B:  Not lately though [laughter].
0 A:  We have been talking about this, I tried to call earlier,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and we had made a list of all these, uh, baseball teams and the cities
0 B:  Threw it away [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, gosh.  Let's see.  The teams that, I think the A's were in it last
0 year.  The Oakland A's, and I think it was, I don't think it was an all
0 A:  [Breathing] Well, have you ever played baseball?
0 B:  I played softball.
0 A:  Well, that's what I did when I was growing up.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, that's fun [laughter].  That's a whole different sport.
0 A:  Uh-huh. {Music in background}.
0 the Pirates will go.  And, uh, let's see, {pause} Rangers have got a new guy
0 A:  Do you ever go see the Rangers?
0 anybody out there, not very many people out there.  It's a lot more fun when
0 your not fighting a crowd.
0 A:  Yeah.  I think it's fun, I like just looking at the billboards.
0 B:  Yeah.  B-, sometimes when I, if you go out there during the day, you just
0 fry under the sun.
0 A:  Yeah, it's nice at night.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  It is.
0 A:  Well,
0 B:  And do you know anything about that new stadium, have you seen all those
0 pictures that they're going to put out there?
0 A:  No.
0 B:  Yeah, that, that huge it's suppose to be a huge stadium and it's going to
0 have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running
0 through it.  And, uh, they're going to try to make it a real community center
0 out there. Cou-, 
0 A:  And your going to be able to buy your, what was, no, wait (( )) about the
0 liquor?
0 B:  That's, that's in, uh, Texas stadium where the football players,
0 A:  Oh, yeah, so you,
0 B:  play and they're never going to let liquor in there. 
0 A:  Well, they're trying.
0 B:  I know, but they try every year and every year they get thrown out.  It's
0 so stupid because they let you take it in there, but they don't, they don't
0 allow you to sell it, don't allow them to sell it there.
0 A:  Uh-huh [noise].
0 B:  But, uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice, and I heard that
0 you, so.
0 B:  And it's going to go to the highest bidder [laughter].
0 A:  Oh [breathing].  Well, that's the way to do it.
0 (( )).
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  {Speaks to child in the background} ((Holly)) turn it down.  I think it's
0 the Bart man, the Simpsons [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, God [laughter].  I stay away from them.
1 A:  I wish I could [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] I bet you do.
0 @@A:  Well, where are you?
0 A:  Okay, I'm in Garland.
0 B:  Oh, what's he teach?
0 A:  C V A E.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  So, what do you do?
0 A:  I teach, but I teach for Dallas.
0 B:  Oh, you do?
0 A:  For right now.  I'm trying to get out.  {Background noises and voices}.
0 B:  Is that a tough system to be in?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Real hard?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah, I would think it,
0 A:  I mean it's good because they, they try new things, you know, but it's
0 else, you know,
0 A:  and you get tired of that. 
0 B:  That's typical bureaucracy though.
0 A:  [Breathing].
0 in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  I don't know, sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad. 
0 A:  Well, but they can't be though, they don't have as much money.
0 B:  Yeah,
0 A:  Most of the time.
0 B:  but the politics, the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes.
0 A:  Oh man, in Dallas you don't even know who's in, in administration, there's
0 so many of them [laughter].
1 B:  You don't even know who to payoff, huh?  [laughter].
0 what they're there for, you know, when they're coming, how long they're going
0 to be,
0 B:  Yeah, oh, how funny.
0 A:  you know, it's just (( )) there they are and they're writing the whole
1 A:  No.  I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything,
0 A:  and I finally just got to where I go, okay, I'm Debbie Moore, you know,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Because, you know, you never know where they are going what they'll report
0 or,
0 B:  I know.
0 A:  [Cough] and they'll tell you they've written something down, and you
0 hope they're telling you [laughter] the truth.
0 A:  No [laughter], huh-uh.
1 B:  Ugh, that's about, uh, ten too many.
0 A:  [Laughter] No, actually it's, now my job's good,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  much better than a lot, 
0 A:  because I'm Chapter One, 
0 A:  and all I do is teach reading all day long,
0 B:  Oh.
0 B:  Oh, well, that's not bad.
0 A:  No.  It's good, and you've got a lot of federal money, too.
0 A:  Teaching?  [noise].
0 A:  Oh, yes.
0 B:  Or working in the system.
0 A:  Yes, when I first started teaching, I remember I went to my (( )) and I
0 said, okay, I want to see a curriculum guide, you know, so I'll know what I'm
0 one is.
0 B:  Oh, God [laughter].
0 A:  And so I go, okay, I mean, you just, you did [laughter], what you wanted
0 to do,
0 B:  How funny.
0 A:  [Throat_clearing] and now they tell you what to teach and how long and,
0 you know, what day,
0 B:  Yeah, you don't know which is,
0 A:  what period.  
0 B:  you don't know, which is worse. 
0 A:  Yeah.  No, I know which is worse.
0 B:  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, being told what to do is worse.
0 A:  [Throat_clearing] Uh-huh.
0 B:  So, how long are we suppose to talk for?
0 A:  Well, you can talk for ten minutes but you don't have to.
0 A:  Yeah, and no, if you talk to ten then they come ov-, on and say, oh, you've
0 extended your limit, and please say good-bye within the next five seconds.
0 B:  Oh, I haven't ever talked that long.
0 retired administrator from Cleveland, Ohio,
0 B:  ((Uh-huh)).
0 B:  He lives in Cleveland?
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Wow.
0 around here.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  But, she was real interesting.
0 B:  Huh.
0 A:  And then tonight this woman called, have you taken any incoming calls?
0 A:  Okay.  So hers was the first one I got, gotten and, uh, and she was telling
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  and it went over ten minutes. 
0 B:  Did she, did she, did you all not talk about the topic at all?
0 A:  Well, yeah, we did, but the topic was boring I thought.
0 B:  Oh.
0 B:  Oh, gosh, (( )) all the other, the one I talked about the other night was
0 good, it was, um, about movies, you know, what have you seen at the movies
0 lately and stuff like that.
0 A:  Oh yeah, I could go on and on about that.
0 he was, boy it sounds like your really up on this.  I said, I see at least two
0 a week [laughter].
0 B:  So, that was real good to talk about that.  Have you seen like, uh,
0 SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
0 A:  No.
0 A:  The last one I saw was DANCES OF THE, WITH THE WOLVES, (( )) WOLVES.
0 B:  Yeah, we talked about that one too.  And he, he said he didn't think it
0 should have gotten all those awards, he thought it was too long but I, 
0 A:  Oh, I enjoyed it.
0 B:  I did, too.
0 B:  Yeah.  I didn't think it was too long at all.  Uh, he said after about the
0 first hour he started looking at his watch.
0 A:  Huh.
0 B:  And, how old are your kids? 
0 A:  One is eight and one is eleven.
0 B:  You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  It's,
0 A:  They usually pick their own.
0 B:  I bet they do.
0 A:  You know, they've got it all figured out.
0 B:  Yeah, they want to see all the horror movies.
0 A:  Well, and Ninja Turtles.
0 B:  Yeah, Ninja Turtles, got to have those.
0 A:  But most of the time really we watch them on the video.
0 B:  Oh, yeah, you brin-, that's,
0 B:  well heck, that's a lot cheaper then, uh,
0 A:  Going to,
0 A:  I know.
0 B:  Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch
0 them all in one ni-, one time.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  plug it in.
0 B:  Of course, you have to get there early if you want to get anything,
0 A:  I know {Voice in background}.
0 B:  decent. 
0 A:  It's good when you go to Tom Thumb though and they're cheap and nobody has
0 got them yet.
0 B:  That's true.
0 A:  Unbelievable [sniffing].  {Background music gets even louder}.
0 off at the end, you know.  It just, it, I don't know, it one of those movies
0 it's not going to be around long, it will be a dollar movie in no time.
0 A:  Do you read?
0 B:  Not very much, no.
0 A:  No?
0 B:  I don't have the patience to read [laughter].
0 A:  See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night.
0 B:  Yeah.  Oh, my Mom and Dad read all the time.
0 A:  You saw FIELD OF DREAMS, right, a long time ago? 
0 B:  Yeah, sure did.
0 A:  Well, I was reading the book, and it's called SHOELESS JOE.
0 B:  Oh, really?
0 A:  It was so wonderful.  And then I was, um, I decided, well, I like this
0 author, so I got a, uh, book of his short stories, and that's been real good.
0 B:  Who is the, is the author?
0 A:  Don't, don't ask me [laughter].
0 B:  Oh  [laughter].
0 A:  The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book.
0 B:  Shoeless Joe.  Was it like the movie?
0 B:  Okay.
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Huh.
0 A:  that's one difference.  There really wasn't a lot of difference.
0 A:  Well, do you think we covered baseball?
0 B:  I think so [laughter].
0 the house built and so this is our, our fifth year in it I guess, and, uh, um,
0 it was a real excitement to, uh, to go out and select the house and have one
0 made and built and like you wanted it, we were the fourth to build out of
0 three hundred and forty houses.  And, um, as we did with probably ninety-five
0 percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs
0 home, and they're good for about five years or four years and after that they
0 start falling apart.  So, I would, uh, not recommend F and J house for my dog
0 to live in, uh, because they're overpriced, uh, but they're a cheap house.  If
0 you can't afford something good, you know, they're good for that, and, um, you
0 can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your
0 head, but as far as the costs for what your getting, uh, the longevity of the
0 house is not, uh, is not worth it.  How about in your case?
0 A:  Well, in my case my husband is not a carpenter, but, in fact, he's in
0 electronics, but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would
0 build it.  So it took him about two and a half years, but, uh, he built us a
0 house, it's, uh, we have thirty-two hundred square feet, and it's a brick
0 house, and price-wise, it was great because he did it all himself, you know,
0 so that way he could, we could kind of control,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and I mean it's nothing fancy, you know, it's, it's a house, it's nice,
0 B:  Well, that's great, that's great, that's, uh, I've heard, I have another
0 gentleman, friend of mine, who, uh, who had a house built as a matter of fact
0 another guy is building one now, he's been doing it for three years and the
0 city's a little upset with him, but I understand you save a lot of money off,
0 uh, by doing that, and, uh,
0 A:  Oh, you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and
0 everybody else.
0 A:  You know.
0 A:  But, uh, of course, my husband did everything except my brother's a trim
0 carpenter, and he came in, you know, and did the inside for us, and that
0 helped.
0 B:  That was a big savings.
0 A:  And, uh, yes, and, uh, we had to hire, of course, the plumbing and the
0 brick and everything else, nothing, you know, he did everything else.
0 B:  Well, that's great.  W-, uh, have you been in it long?
0 A:  We've been in it six years.
0 B:  Oh, really, well, have you any plans to, uh, maybe, uh, expand or move
0 onward?
0 A:  N-, no, we're, well, uh, our kids are kind of still small now, and we had
0 thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll
1 sell it, but he will not build a second one himself.
0 A:  Because he says age-wise he'll never be able to handle that again
0 [laughter].
0 B:  First one is always a bear.
0 A:  Yes, yes.
0 B:  We're having a, an architect friend of mine design a house for us and that
0 can basically be, be put on any lot, in any state, any kin-, you know, so
0 that's kind of,
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  we just got with him and told him what all we wanted,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it and he's
0 re-, certified, and registered so at least we know we're, it's not going to
0 fall in or something if it's built.
0 B:  But, uh, I have heard that your approach is, is right, you can actually go
0 out and sub it, if, even if you don't want to get hands on,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things and,
0 and that's kind of the plan I have so,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  I'm, uh, everyone I talk to, uh, I file in my little book and do other
0 things with it (( )).  That's great, that's great.
0 we could not have one as large as we have if, you know, we hadn't did it
0 B:  Sure, I can imagine.
0 A:  Yeah, I mean it's not an Eldorado house or anything like that, but, you
0 B:  If your happy with it, that's all that counts.
0 A:  That's right.  That's right.
0 B:  That's all, on-, you only have to, uh, satisfy yourself and no one else.
0 A:  Ap-, apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high
0 [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, that's, uh, that's, uh, an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell,
0 I guess.
0 A:  Isn't it?  It really is because I, I'm always shocked at about, you know,
0 what they have it appraised at, I think, oh my goodness.
0 @@B:  (( )) Well that's great.  Well, yeah, I guess that about does it.
0 A:  Okay, and it was nice talking to you.
0 B:  Nice talking with you, too.
0 A:  Okay, bye-bye.
0 B:  So you're a woodworker, uh?
0 A:  Well, yeah, I like to do a little remodeling work and in older homes and
0 B:  What do you know about timber framing?
0 A:  Pardon me?
0 B:  What do you know about timber framing?
0 B:  Right, right.
0 A:  That type?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 here, although I understand they do in the Southwest quite a bit.  But, um, up
0 here we generally use, uh, uh, frame construction work or wood frame
0 south, I guess, are brick but here they're pretty much wood frame
0 construction on a two by four's, and, and, uh, one by twelve boarding on the
0 outside, or sheet plywood and then some kind of a insulation material and
0 covered with clapboards or shingles.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.  The reason I asked is because we're embarking on a little adventure
0 here in that we're going to use, uh, some timber framing techniques to build a,
0 A:  Sure.
0 B:  Like a barn, yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh
0 B:  And they're mansard trusses that don't have any internal bracing so the
0 whole area is like a cathedral up there for the second floor.
0 they're again, they're, they're truss construction but, they're well braced.
0 A:  You know, cross braced inside, held together by steel cleats and stuff.
0 A:  Uh, mansard roofs are, are in bond building, I guess, are, they do a lot of
0 that, I understand, by laminating the series of, of beams of planks together
0 and, and with,
0 B:  Yeah tha-, that's done some where they're actually create a, a single piece
0 that is the truss.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 uh, cut the joints so that the, the more pressure you put on it the stronger
0 it gets,
0 B:  And it involves interleaving and, uh, using, uh, you know locking wedges.
0 A:  Sure, sure something like the way you'd do, uh, um, bricks around a window,
0 around a large window,
0 B:  Yeah, similar to that, yeah.
0 A:  type thing, the center, the center brick is the key brick which locks
0 everything together.  That's a pretty neat idea.  Are you building, are  
0 you,
0 B:  Well, if I do that and then cover it with, uh, two by six tongue and
0 groove,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  it will be pretty sturdy because we have to, we, we got what we call
0 Santa Ana wind down here,
0 A:  Okay.
0 B:  it comes up out of Mexico at about a hundred miles an hour.
0 A:  Where are you located?
0 A:  Okay.
0 B:  right on the Red River.
0 A:  Yeah, okay.  I lived in Abilene for about ten years.
0 B:  Well, then you know about that wind.
1 A:  Oh, yeah a little bit [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  It gets a little dusty there.  Lubbock blows by there about once a month,
0 if I remember [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  I worked for the T I plant in Abilene and, and I sure enjoyed the
0 B:  Uh-huh {Very faint}.
0 A:  But, uh, that, that's an interesting concept, uh, uh, is this going to be
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, we, we bought this land out here we're going, we're going to retire
0 on it maybe in twenty-five, thirty years from now but, you know, we're, we're
0 still fairly young.
0 A:  I saw a log cabin built down there that I was really impressed with and it
0 sounds like it's similar to the open construction that you're going to have
0 where the only thing enclosed upstairs were the bedrooms --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- but the rest of the center portion of the cabin, which was a huge, huge
0 house, was all open and the thing I really liked about it was it had a porch
0 on all four sides of the house, all the way around the house.
0 B:  Well we're only going to have a porch on north and south end.
0 B:  So the whole wall just opens up it will be all glass.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  ((because)) on the piece of property we have it's the second highest
0 pointed in the county and we can see Oklahoma to the north, the lights of
0 Gainesville to the east and the lights of Wichita Falls to the west,
0 A:  Wow.  Boy, that's quite a distance.
0 B:  And that's a it's, it's we're just right on the southern rim of the Red
0 River Valley.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  I have a, a pretty good idea where it is.  Of course, I know
0 Wichita Falls pretty well.
0 B:  You know where Nocona is?
0 A:  Pardon me?
0 B:  Nocona?
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Okay, that's about as far north as we can see just, you know, right on the
0 other side of the river there.
0 A:  Uh-huh, well that's really interesting.
0 B:  And, boy, it's really nice, it's about an hour drive to work though.
0 doesn't get too heavy until you head in toward, uh, toward Dallas a little
0 bit, but you should spread out pretty good out there I know.
0 B:  We don't have any traffic.
0 A:  Yeah, out in West Texas there was hardly any at all in Abilene but, well
0 that's a little different here in New England we sure got some around Boston
0 B:  I used to live in, uh, Springfield, well actually Chicopee Falls.
0 A:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, I live about, I live just over the line of south of
0 Attleboro, Massachusetts into Rhode Island, and it's just north of the City of
0 Providence so about forty miles from Boston but the traffic on the interstate
1 B:  ((That's)) unbelievable.
0 A:  [Laughter] but it moves pretty well, so, well ((Roy)) it's sure been nice
0 talking with you and, uh, uh, hopefully we'll have another conversation
0 probably another way down the road, good luck with your new home.
0 B:  Yeah, it will be a lot of fun we're digging the foundation by hand.
0 A:  Is that right?
0 B:  Yeah, the first floor's going to be underground.
0 A:  Okay, and, and,
0 B:  Of course it will be open on the south and north end.
0 A:  Sure.
0 B:  And east and, well, see we have a little knoll on our property --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- about thirty feet tall and it's almost straight up, so we'll nestle the
0 house right up next to it.
0 A:  Are you going to take advantage of the, the ground thermal action and,
0 A:  and, and, uh, use for your heat and cooling?
0 B:  Cooling,
0 A:  For cooling especially, yeah,
0 B:  we don't have to worry about heat, I mean.
0 A:  yeah, yeah, well your winters get a little cold down there sometimes
0 but,
0 B:  Yeah, but they're very short.
0 @@A:  Yeah, that's for sure [laughter].  Uh, well we're still in our winter up
0 here right now the temperature is eighteen degrees [laughter].
0 B:  Well, the temperature [static] Tuesday was ninety-six.
1 A:  [Static] Yeah, uh.
0 B:  [Laughter] It was tough.
0 A:  I can stand that.
0 B:  Today was cold, in the seventies.
0 A:  Yeah, well it's been cold up here, the mornings have been cold.  The winds
0 outside.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  It went from thirty-eight to ninety-six on Tuesday.
0 A:  Is that right [/static]?
0 colds and stuff like that, you know.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  The, the temperature change is too drastic like that it should come a
0 little more gradual, I think.
0 B:  Well, if you don't like the weather in Texas just wait a minute.
0 B:  Well, you have a good day.
0 B:  All right.

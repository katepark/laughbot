1 let's just put it that way,
0 B:  -- I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan --
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
1 B:  Well, it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society
1 B:  Oh, my.

0 plants, because our summers are so terribly hot --
0 coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window
0 bite to eat and they left the dog in the car, and I guess while we were inside
1 B:  I think it would be,
0 you know, that really snowballed when we got down here, when I
0 you know, wish that there was some way to, uh, send a message to

1 A:   [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Rock and roll?  [laughter]. 
0 A:  So not much difference.  Yeah, I was a music minor in college. 
1 B:  Yeah, I had fun with it.  As, as long as it wasn't too dull and boring
0 B:   Oh, my God.
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
1 guess to do that I'd probably have to take it at home.  
1 come out of the sand, [laughter] and it tore the ligaments in my
0 B:   Uh, my, my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to
1 A:   Yes.

0 B:   It got real cold, but the, uh, camper had, uh, beds in it, you
1 and this, you know, s-, frog strangler that we used to call them, 
0 guess the next one is, is door-to-door --
1 A:  -- too.  Other times [baby_crying] it's, you know, wasting your time,

0 [clicking] it.
0 A:  Yeah, if you've talked to someone, like you're talking to me now --
0 A:   Okay.  
1 B:   Because I, I am the type that will always find an emergency

0 B:   Right, right.  Well, uh, gosh, my kids are older now, so I
1 B:   -- and, yeah.  
0 A:   Uh, I guess, [laughter] I don't know.  It's the first time

0 constantly.  We just, uh, passed a new one, uh, fortunately or unfortunately
0 and this and that and feed their family, and put their kids in college just

1 B:  -- I recognize these.
0 A:  Well, that's good.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, we've got a calico cat too.
0 really enjoyable, uh, thing for me to do.
0 now, rather, in the eastern corner of it, so, I don't think he

0 B:  Well.
1 they just grow rocks and (( )).
1 A:  That is a pretty car.
1 A:  So, uh, I have really been impressed.  I said, I probably never be able, 
0 whatever, because it never has been resolved with Palmer

0 wanted a private life.
0 A:  Because I play lots of tennis and I'm gone a lot, so, I don't
0 B:   Um, I would have maybe, um, say if it was like Greek night or

0 B:  -- and we pretty much fill it up with, uh, like I said, perennials, things
0 B:  Uh, I think that's a good thing in the sense that it, um, it stops someone
1 A:  So I thought that was kind of an in-, interesting coincidence.
0 percent of, uh, college students actually graduate in four years from a four

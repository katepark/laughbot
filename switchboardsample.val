0 B:  Well, I work in, uh, Corporate Control, so we have to dress kind of nice,
0 so I usually wear skirts and sweaters in the winter time, slacks, I guess.
0 A:  And is,
0 A:  Right, right.  Is there, is there, um, a-, is there a, like a code of dress
0 B:  but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit
0 B:  Yes, now, you know, if, if every-, like in August when everybody is on
0 but, 
0 B:  [Laughter] I guess that would have to do with the weather.
0 B:  #But, um,#
0 A:  Yeah, and it was usually, uh, also, uh, where I was, it was, um, i-, in
0 B:  Yeah, or, uh-huh.
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  so, um, and, uh,
0 B:  Okay.
0 A:  but, anyway, um, and seas-, really same, season to season, um, uh, it
0 A:  weather, you know,
0 conditioner,
0 the summer,
0 B:  Uh-huh, just suits.
0 A:  That's right.
0 A:  Tha-, [laughter] That's, that's true, so, um,
0 B:  So,
0 B:  you know?  Most of the people do, anyway, and most of the women wear, um,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I'm a secretary.  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  is how I determine,
0 A:  Yeah and,
0 A:  #Okay, alright.#
0 had t-, place my mother in a nursing home.  She had a rather massive stroke
0 about, uh, about --
0 I was personally acquainted with the, uh, people who, uh, ran the nursing home
0 in our little hometown.
0 B:  So, I was very comfortable, you know, in doing it when it got to the point
0 might be available.  Of course, you know, there's not one on every corner,
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  and it got so much that she could not take care of her house.
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  -- and, you know, she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her
0 mines.
0 that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make
0 things for our family, getting down together and doing that.
0 A:  -- to perform.  You know, whether it was just, you know, giving money or
0 coming.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Absolutely.  Unfortunately, a lot of times it, responsibilities
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  That's great. 
0 A:  And, um, I mean, but she was truly, she was truly aware.  I mean, I, I, I
0 di-, I don't know how I would, how I would deal if one of my parents came
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 care --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  That's the, that's probably the major question. 
0 B:  in a whole lot of areas. 
0 B:  Just people are, of course, populations getting older. 
0 rural situation --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Uh. 
0 going to be a good, [laughter] they're going to be a good caretaker for our
0 B:  just because they're grandparents. 
0 that, you know, perhaps, you know, we may need to like get close to the family
0 A:  -- that may, that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- but the qua-, but actually have a truer standard of living.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  All right. 
0 B:  #Bye-bye.# 
0 A:  Um, does your work entitle, uh, anything of environmental along these
0 the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such.  But the
0 for that place.  And that there's, you know, limits as to what we can, uh,
0 let, you know, go into the air.
0 A:  And so the Sherman deal is, um, uh, [laughter] lost a lot of hair over that
0 B:  Oh [laughter].
0 A:  Uh, what we run into, um, is we have the Texas Air Control Board, T A C
0 contributions so that, basically, we go and do things like put in high tech
0 A:  are very, um, aware of the opacity, which is the thickness of a stack
0 A:  The Sherman facility, we are still in the, closer too, but still have a
0 little bit of, um, finalization to do.  Right.  It's been pitched to the
0 A:  open arms, as well as the public.  We had open forum and, and, uh, uh,
0 Tom Jones, our environmental, corporate environmental guys handle the project.
0 else.  Yeah.  they're, they're, they're in the same issue.  We were hoping on
0 burning a lot of the effluent up there.  Uh, because the, the system is setup
0 A:  it was human nature.  But it won't have can any, uh, any bad stuff.  So,
0 uh, I think T I, we spend, of all the major semiconductor firms, we probably
0 engineering behind the system of any other firm I know of.  We eat and sleep
0 B:  Well, I know from some of the sites that we've had, uh, quite a list of
0 know, mega bucks to, uh, you know take everything out and redo it and, you
0 A:  Possibly.
0 B:  There, there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place
0 leaked again.  [laughter] (( )).
0 duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where, um, they
0 something like that because it's a solid.  And we mix it with concrete --
0 very, very, uh, cognizance of, and aware of all these types of, uh,
0 you know, I think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  place in, you know, T I that had the gray metal desk.  People used to
0 B:  finally got a little respect.  Nobody thought of us as a profit center
0 B:  You too.
0 that other stuff they're dumping out into the atmosphere causing acid rain and
0 everything else.
0 uh, eating away at our --
0 place of Freon, though?
0 A:  Well, I was, I was thinking about that, too.  I mean, uh, we don't have any
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Yeah.      
0 B:  that's why our present day refrigerants, uh, systems are not dangerous
0 A:  Right.  Which happens all the time when they go to service the things.
0 And therefore, you won't be able to just pull in anywhere to, or you wouldn't
0 anything else.  I, I think we're getting a handle on sulfur dioxides and all
0 A:  [Throat_clearing]. 
0 A:  Burning and everything else.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 And I just have a feeling, that, you know, that's our, that's our air
0 B:  I tell you, a funny thing happened to me with, with polluted water.  Uh, T
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 unfortunately we're out of it right now.  But, as,
1 B:  as soon as we get it, I, I'll see that you get a bottle of it.
0 And would you believe it?  I brushed my teeth with Coca-Cola.
1 A:  Oh, I can believe it. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A: Gee.  Well, that's scary.  I, it, it worries me to turn on the, turn on the
0 stories about, well, the government okayed this.  And then all of a sudden you
0 around and do it that way it's dangerous.
0 A:  Yeah, well, it's, it's like so many, it's like chicken.  You know, they go
0 seeing that.  And, but the government says it's safe.  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh, yeah.  
0 country.  [sniffing] And they s-, yeah, it's getting better, it's getting
0 B:  air pollution.  
0 A:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know.  You know, used to be a lot of states had, uh, uh,
0 you had to have your car checked for pollution every year, you had to have
0 Louisiana does, I'm not sure.  But I, there's not very many of them around any
0 ten years.
0 A:  Yeah, they don't do it any more.  
0 diesel engines were the thing because it was, uh, so much cheaper than gas.
0 B:  [Static] Uh-huh.  Yeah.  T-, t-, tell me about it.  I just got rid of, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.  Winter, 
0 polluting?
0 corduroy shorts with a white blouse, um, and flat shoes.
0 A:  So, can you dress pretty casually? 
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  And then come home and get back into regular clothes again [laughter].
0 B:  Right. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Um, yeah mostly.  I mean, at home I predominantly wear {speaker laughs
0 A:  Yeah. 
1 slacks,
0 B:  And, um, but I'm really the only woman, I guess, at work that does that,
0 A:  I guess down here, uh, we just recently moved to Texas, so my wardrobe has
0 B:  But, um, you know, I, I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater
0 dresses.
0 A:  Yeah.  I'd like to be able to wear those here.  Today it's eighty-eight
0 degrees.
0 A:  Needless to say, my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while
0 A:  Today was, uh, definitely a shorts day around here. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  [Throat_clearing]. 
0 B:  Yeah, we're still pretty much, you know, in winter, as far as that goes
0 A:  out and about. 
0 A:  Sounds good. 
0 B:  Oh, oh where's that [laughter]?
0 just, you know, what we did in the summer, go from (()) national park to
0 A:  When I go camping, I don't, I don't like to rough it.  I like to have a
0 and,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Oh, me neither, me neither.  Th-, the mosquitoes just keep you up all
0 the camper is when you want to sleep [laughter],
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  otherwise you're just going constantly. You know, in all the, in all the
0 B:  Oh, how awful.
0 A:  But we had a good time in our camper.  We usua-, we usually took box games
0 good time.
0 Now I wish I could go back to those places. [laughter] The time, I've got,
0 A:  Oh God, makes it a little,
0 B:  I wish I had time.  My, our pop-up camper just sits in the garage and
0 collects dust, unfortunately.
0 load up the rest of the wives,
0 without spending big money for a hotel and,
0 B:  So, it, it's a, it can be really handy to have a camper.  Just cause, my,
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 much it, we've been on here awhile [barking].
0 A:  Okay.
0 B:  Well, it's been nice talking to you.
0 B:  No.  I haven't.
0 B:  Um, I've visited the Wyoming area.  I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH
0 to that?
0 just going to be a dud.  So, it, it has surprised everybody.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Did you?
0 A:  No.  I've heard, I've heard that's really great, though.
0 B:  Go.
0 A:  You must really keep up.
0 must see movies, I think.
0 suspense.  Um, the other one, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, is kind of a, a gory
0 A:  He's a, the movie critic.  Um, oh, you've, oh, okay.  He's a movie critic
0 Sunday night a little bit when,
0 he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him.
0 driver?
0 A:  -- he's Eldon, her housepainter.
0 and yeah, it was him, but with a --
0 A:  and it wa-, it was really funny, it's, uh, that, that he winds up
0 [laughter] playing in the movie.  But I thought, it's good that, you know, it
0 about five minutes.  I should think we've done enough.
0 B:  It used to,
0 B:  it used to just automatically cut off but it says when the conversation
0 A:  [Laughter] Why don't we do that?
0 finds something out about you that's another.  And the first kind of invasion
0 does not seem, uh, um, obviously, everyday.
0 reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message and then I realize,
0 B:  Exactly.  Uh, and at the same time I think that I receive on, on the order
0 B:  Commercial,
0 respond even though there's not even a person there.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  because of some sense of, of the way the ritual is played out.
0 for me.
0 A:  Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it,
0 I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I
0 things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it,
0 think I'd like the K G B is monitoring my phone or anything like that.
0 of my privacy state having been invaded.
0 A:  Uh-huh,
0 A:  uh-huh.   
0 A:  Yes, yes, ev-, more harmed or something.
0 B:  you don't have anyway to turn it off.  Tho-, did you hear about this
0 A:  Yes, I did.  I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled
0 the sense of the spending pattern, for instance,
0 B:  or if my call rate of, of eight t-, or so a week went up even higher
0 B:  a sudden you get your thirty a week because now,
0 A:  Yeah.
0  
1 B:  Right.  Right.
0 B:  Right.
0 invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling,
0 another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my
0 privacy because I know how to behave such that there isn't.  But I realized I
0 If I deviate from social norms of behavior, if I run up and down the street
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 was often surprised,
0 A:  You know, it very much is.  But on the other hand, I realized I could go
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 the, uh, the norms of social, of, um, public behavior.  Um, people start
0 B:  Yes.
0 A:  and things like that, I mean, they a-, [laughter], you go to India and
0 it's obvious, you know, the results of sex are quite obvious, [laughter], as
0 the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years.  Um, but I, I
0 B:  Yes.
0 people wil-,
0 day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency?
0 B:  Good.  And yourself? 
0 A:  Where am I calling? 
0 B:  I'm in Lewisville.
0 B:  And, as far as I'm concerned, you know, hey, twenty bucks a year is not too
0 much too me, and they could raise a few more dollars and get better, uh,
0 things for the schools.  That's what we need.  Because we got,
0 A:  That's right.  But just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean
0 B:  Are you? 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  they're already talking about freedom of choice, you know, for schools,
0 A:  That's true. 
0 A:  But like in Garland [child_yelling] you can choose [child_yelling] the
0 school that you're going to.  [laughter] Can you tell this is past bedtime?
0 their district, you know, out of their area, I mean.
0 B:  Yes. 
0 B:  Yes. 
0 B:  I think the only way they're going to really get to the problem and solve
0 good teacher doesn't want to become a teacher usually because they don't pay
0 A:  Oh, so you picked a good field then.
0 A:  Well.
0 A:  But that's not a bad one. 
0 quite a bit, but where I was before I wasn't using it hardly at all.  So it
0 A:  But didn't they pass that thing that we were going to have a lottery or
0 campaign, she said, we weren't going to have a state income tax.  And now
0 she's going to renege on that, which I expected her to do anyway.  Uh, we'll
0 A:  No?
0 B:  Um, I'm surprised that m-, uh, my income taxes are as low as they are.  We
0 just finished our income taxes and we're getting a nice little refund back
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  And you're going to think, well, wait now.  Where's the other eighteen
0 into debt so deeply.  They bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one
0 percent, I guess they got a little table though and it's all written out.
0 family.
0 income tax, uh,
0 for the federal government release that if they, uh, uh, will, like fe-, on
1 the welfare system,
0 not making that much money.  They're making probably more like five or six,
0 B:  Lots of people. 
0 A:  Before they get it.
0 A:  But still, I work in southeast Dallas and a lot of my children are from p-,
0 A:  And, I mean, they've always got dessert money, or they've always got, you
0 dollar in my wallet, it's like, boy, where do I gr-, where do I find that?
0 we pay people to haul them off.  Right?
1 B:  Yeah.  Right. 
0 A:  [Laughter] And then like, a guy does it and he has his own pigs.
0 right to have a hand gun in their house, if they so choose.
0 B:  An, but I think there should be some restrictions when you buy one, you
0 gun, my, my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted, like an
1 everybody is a hunter so [laughter],
0 A:  It's true.  Yeah.
0 B:  They will always have a way, look at drugs.  They always have a way to
0 with a lot of people that hunt, and they just, they, they don't see any sense
0 realize there are a bunch of crazy people out there that, don't use it for
0 B:  I think we just hang up.
0 a computer voice that comes on the line.  Those are the ones that I really,
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, sometimes I, I get them on my, uh, answering
0 A:  and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people, I
0 every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them.
0 B:  Uh-huh, yes, see I have an unlisted telephone number, but I still get all
0 of my privacy.  I agree with you on that particular subject there.  Let me
0 even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations, uh, but
0 there's people coming around, you know, and they're trying to sell something
0 serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going
0 have my own.
1 otherwise, cause I still get,
0 you know I don't think that that would stop people.  I, it's like they see that
0 A:  But, I consider an invasion of my privacy,
1 A:  I'm drawing a blank.
0 B:  Pretty close.
0 A:  Well I've enjoyed talking with you. 
0 B:  Okay, uh, well, I've lived in the, in the Dallas and Richardson area for
0 B:  And we're in our second home now.
0 A:  Oh, so, you're an old pro then.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 went to school at Rice and got his P h d. so that, that's what brought
0 sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one, you know, that
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 everything she wa-, you know, thinks she'll ever want in a house and it was
0 house, uh, we've had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  Well, since like I say, we're first time homeowners, I'm still
0 call, uh, post tensioned, which means that there are iron bars, you
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Well that's good, well that's really good.
0 B:  Yeah, right, now is yours a, is it a slab foundation or a pier and beam.
0 just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago, so.
0 deal.  So, well I, uh, appreciate that information about Richardson.
0 B:  Yeah, so, well it, uh, you know, I think it's, uh, a good place to live, of
0 [laughter]
0 B:  Hi.
0 though.
0 A:  Uh, no, I think no-, now, you go to work when they're six weeks old,
0 A:  It really is.
0 with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since
0 B:  Yeah.
0 though, huh [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh, also, with, uh, women in the work force they've gotten a lot more
0 options as far as, you know, what's it called, job sharing.
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah we get the full benefits.
0 B:  Yeah, especially with children, and so many things going on,
0 miss any of those  P T A -s and, you know, all of that.
0 A:  Yes, oh, I do too. 
0 B:  Plus, I bet it cuts, cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two
0 you're just really sick, or the child's sick.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 was sick, and I know she probably didn't make hardly anything, you know,
0 and women work in the same job, I think men get paid more,
0 A:  Oh, I do too.
0 but,
0 A:  They really are.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh, it's still just a pup. 
0 B:  Pretty much, yeah, yeah. 
0 B:  Oh, that sounds interesting.
0 A:  it is a fi-, fixed female, by the way, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  and, uh, I live in motor home, by the way, I'm, uh, an R V, full time R V
1 smiling from ear to ear, she's so happy to see me.
0 B:  we've always got, uh, got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window
0 A:  Uh, she'd rather sle-, sleep outside on the, the cold ground at night.
0 A:  And I feed her indoors, that's to lure her in, but during the day I have
0 B:  Okay.
0 twelve foot leash,
0 B:  Okay.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, [laughter] yeah that's, uh, definite security involved in, uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  but adults, if they're strange to her, or, or they look suspicious or
0 something, boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.
0 A:  You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention.
0 for her.  She's only been around one and, and sometimes two people at the most
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  but, uh, definitely not an apartment type animal so he, uh, he had to stay
0 home.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, it really was.  He, uh, apparently had a tough time with it for
0 a little while and then he, he got, he came to accept the fact that Mom and
0 Dad were his company from then on, but, uh.
0 A:  Uh-huh, oh well.
0 A:  Take care now.
0 music do you like?
0 A:  Well, I mostly listen to popular music.  I, uh, listen to it all the time
0 I have some little children and I, unfortunately, found myself listening to a
0 the version is done right, I like it [laughter],
0 B:  but, if, if it's not, then I won't.  I, I really don't,
0 thing I do object to about rap music is, is when it becomes militant,
0 B:  I, I have strong objections to that.  Um, actually I listen to, one time I
0 remember, this was back when, even, uh, I would say about ten or fifteen years
0 about, I think about forty or fifty years old.  And, it was incredible, I
0 mean, the parallel, you know, between it and rap.
0 A:  but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm.  And, uh, sounds, it sounds
0 lot of rap music and, uh, she thinks its pretty funny how often I know all of
0 B:  Yeah.
0 the original composer,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Who?
0 A:  Was it, well, ma-, maybe it wasn't that one. Because, it was a living, it
0 A:  from him to use it.  And, he, he since then has, has amended that, and
0 B:  Yeah.  I don't know it may have, it may have been somebody else, because I
0 think, I think that even Jimi Hendrix did it, I think that was a cov-, you
0 know, come to think of it, I think that was a cover version of, like a John
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  [Laughter] I, I think a good one was, um, there was a Peter Frampton song,
0 hideous.
0 B:  Yeah.  I did too.
0 A:  I think it was in high school.
0 B:  Yeah.  I've, I graduated back in seventy-nine, so,
0 A:  Um, um. Uh-huh.
0 B:  so I was really familiar with a lot, with a lot of, of the A O R type
0 B:  and, the, uh, the Beatles, and you know, I mean, a lot of people they go,
0 B:  I mean, the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles
0 that.
0 think, um,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  drawing from a lot of different sources and making, you know, a synthesis
0 A:  What do you mean by world music?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, then when they hear it, it, it's a really, it's another form of music,
0 B:  you know, sort of, um, trying to draw out the best sources.  The, the
0 say that I, I completely like heavy metal.
0 A:  No.
0 are really, um, that are extremely enjoyable, and then taking,
0 B:  Yeah, okay, but, I mean, when I heard his album, I heard it and it was just
0 our, our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were
0 is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on whatever we've got
0 each half of the month and then trying to also spe-, because our house payment
0 A:  What do you all do?
0 we sat down and determined how much we could spend.  We sat dow-, made up
0 household expenses, or food, and clothing and entertainment and then our, our
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, I stay wi-, I have to stay within it, so I, you know, and then
0 we have that, you know, if you can't stay, if something comes up and you can't
0 you're not, you know, you don't feel it so strapped.
0 can't pay off by the end of the month.
0 that year, we've taken that this year,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Free.
0 A:  That's good to be in that kind of shape.
0 B:  We try to stay out of debt [child].
0 A:  So that's, that's worked out pretty good and then, I used to work for T I
0 figure, to, put it, we're putting it in C D's right now,
0 we had one of the financial companies, um, han-, uh, John Hancock company came
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:   or not, yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  That sounds interesting, we've never done any-, we have, you know,
0 if something happened to me, that's a, a big thing to think about.
0 A:  Okay, I guess that's most of my, um, financial plans right now.
0 B:  and I believe we all do, and it's, it's just too easy to use.
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh, I believe that, uh, mine would say the same, uh, but, uh,
0 A:  Those things there, that's what gets us.
0 B:  And then plus, then you for, end up forgetting to write it down.
0 A:  Well no, he doesn't have that trouble.  He, uh, has this little slip that
0 A:  and he just keeps that.  He keeps fairly decent records.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 credit card to pay off the other loan.
0 A:  Yeah, that's what he's talking about doing now.
0 A:  Yeah, I don't know, I like it, he walks in, you know, and he's got this
0 little card.
1 [laughter].
0 B:  You get started on them and can't quit.
0 wants, you know, and, uh, uh, I'm afraid to, I'm afraid to use that credit
0 B:  Oh yeah, there's that's a weakness there.  That's just, you know, you, you
0 he, he bought a couple pairs of shoes for the kids, you know, I got two kids
0 A:  You know, we went in for a ten dollar piece of thing for the car and ended
0 up sixty, seventy dollars for, uh, at Wal-Mart and then we went to Payless and
0 bought the shoes for the kids [laughter].
0 us.
0 B:  Yeah, we've, yeah, we've had, uh, a sick animal and, uh, the vet, you
0 know, the dog, and vet's are so expensive that, uh, we, uh, the credit card
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 least amount of the, uh, uh, what you call it.
0 A:  you know, uh, the credit limit.  I let him have the one with the least
0 think it's about five hundred limit.  Uh, you know, it's just uh, just one for
0 B:  Oh, well, let's see I guess, we've talked, what, almost five minutes.
0 B:  Oh, I wish I had one of those.
0 popped that credit card out.   It was a Sears [laughter].
0 one I had.
0 got a real good topic and so, well, uh.
0 B:  Yeah, I was just trying to think, uh, I think we've pretty much said it
0 A:  I know I couldn't, uh, we went and we, maxed out quite a few of them
1 uh, you know, I think even one time we used it to pay our rent.
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh goodness.
0 B:  Oh.
0 rent plu-, try-, plus trying to get the money for a ca-, another car and,
0 B:  Get that cash advance, uh-huh [laughter].
0 A:  That's what I'm looking for now, that's why I was just trying to talk
0 reading pleasures are quite wide.  Um, I get a charge out of, uh, TEXAS
0 A:  Right, I've read that one too.  I only had a subscription once, but my
0 B:  Oh yeah, it's, it's, uh, absolutely, it's great the way that it's broken
0 B:  and, uh, kind of strange because I, it's not unusual to, uh, see, uh, an
0 and read just to refresh, uh, you know, to keep active on it, but, uh.
0 uh, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment.
0 Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history.
0 B:  We, uh, we have these classes we attend, uh, management classes and, and
0 B:  Uh, one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you
0 B:  Um, every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the, uh, in the
0 about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of Pat Hagerty and
0 these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 tapes that went with them, but, uh, I guess not so much books although they
0 sometimes have manuals and things, but, uh, they would be things on like how
0 yourself in gear to, uh, sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do
0 B:  Sure.  How about items like, um, THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a
0 B:  So those are self improvements.  
0 And the very last chapter, and I haven't figured out why that one was last, is
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  So it's, it's ver-, it's interesting, here again it's, it's casual reading
0 and it's not eaten up with a lot of, uh, ((mechanical)) stuff and it's really
0 read these ten books because these are self-improvements, I would probably be
1 and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested.
0 A:  [Laughter] I don't know, I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen
0 B:  Yeah, they're, uh, quite, uh, they're hard to set down because it's so
0 movies, but, uh, 
0 A:  Oh, yeah, you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other
0 don't fully understand what, what it is we're saying.  I think it's just
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Um, I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're
0 talking about criminals,
0 A:  in public places.  There is one state that does that, by the way.
0 B:  Really?  What is that?
0 A:  They don't do them real often.
0 A:  Um, but I think if we quit, uh, building, these Taj Mahals with the color T
0 prison, then he's available for parole.  If it's life and a day, then he's not
0 A:  So, what, you know, let's quit B S -ing with the system.
0 spend that money, you know, for children that are starving, or twelve million
0 B:  So to me if somebody has life, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt they
0 B:  You know particularly for some of these really, I mean, there are so many
0 B:  Yeah.
0 me that there were eight, there's a certain perc-, percentage of the people
0 mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a, you know, a fortune to keep
0 murdered, they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they
0 number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more.
0 that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries are for is to make
0 the decision.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah,
0 a, a judge that would really make a good impact.  But likewise, you could have
0 through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they
0 occurrence, you'd have to be pretty dense,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
1 day to business suits the next [laughter].
0 heck of a lot of boxes of documents.
0 doing, you know, odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents, I dress
0 come in, or people from, uh, other party's attorneys and stuff, then I
0 are, I kind of try to judge from day to day.  I know, you know, where I am we
0 all the time and,
0 know they're not, you know, I, I've been doing a lot of reorganization, you
0 A:  and it's just (( )), it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and
0 look through two thousand boxes.  We had them in the warehouse,
0 B:  And the supervisor from another area came up to us and, you know, this
0 he, sho-, he knew who worked there, he should have realized that we weren't
0 regulars in the warehouse there.  And he came up to us and he just said, who's
0 your supervisor.  Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor, and our
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 ((culottes)) all you want but these were shorts.  That's all they were.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 considered, she was in violation and nobody says anything to them.  It's
0 B:  Um.
0 to take an, cut off, you know, that no, this is wear we're going to draw the
0 A:  so, it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going, well God, we
0 wear, you know, but.
0 anymore, you know.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  I mean I've never seen them do it without hose, I mean they always have
0 B:  And, and a particular kind of shoe, you know, so high heel, oh it is
0 B:  And it told about the dress code and it said, these are the color pastel
0 men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way.
0 A:  T I -s says no shorts and no halters [laughter].  I know, that's it.
0 much more done if I'm dressed comfortable, you know.
0 B:  Well the, the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad
0 not the office to the warehouse, but the warehouse.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Well I don't know, I just figure, you know, yeah, sometimes I worry about,
0 you know, if I go in in pants, and I never, I never ever, ever, ever go in in
0 general counsel and it's funny because, there's one that always wears a suit.
0 more ((yuppish)) and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and, you
0 B:  and sometimes he wears the jacket to it.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  We've, we've kind of had a variety there but, I think a lot of times it's,
0 A:  That's the way to do it.  I mean that's the smart way to do it.  
1 know.
0 enjoyable.
0 A:  It really is.
0 B:  We have had highs of seventy-two, lows in the twenties.
0 A:  And, uh, I think a lot of people have contracted, uh, spring fever too,
0 A:  and golfing, reasons and things like that.
0 lines, but fortunately it rains and you, uh, do not have to go out and buy
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  we have had no snow.
0 total accumulation.
1 time.
0 B:  Uh-huh  Well, I spent six years in graduate school at, in Indiana.  In the
0 hour.
0 winter,
0 @@A:  Oh, rea-, where did you go to school in Indiana?
0 B:  Oh, yes.
1 always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame.
0 A:  But, I didn't. Uh.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  And, uh,
0 A:  And, uh, then moved to Dallas about three years ago.  So,
0 B:  Oh. O-,
0 Jack.
0 B:  and have been for a number of years, so I was very much interested,
0 A:  and, uh, [static] they just published this internally, you know, getting
0 people involved.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 the program and so forth, so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in
0 A:  Oh, well.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 uh, concerning recycling [static],
0 A:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 B:  So, I, [laughter] but that, that's interesting.  I have a, uh, uh, friend
0 B:  Uh, a city planner.  And, one of his, and he models, uh, city districts,
0 B:  uh, does computer modeling.
0 because that's,
0 B:  Well, no that's really when I grew up, so that's really what I like better,
1 B:  No, no, no, not that kind of music [laughter].
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Sure, yeah, I like them.
0 kind of music.
0 A:  We're talking about what they, what they call hard rock.
1 A:  well, they're like, for example, A C D C.
0 B:  I mean, I, I think, when you say heavy metal, I'm, I'm thinking about like
0 A:  like, like they hit each other with their shoulders,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  Oh, sure.  Of course.
0 A:  Yeah, especially, uh, oh God, what is it, A Night At The Opera?  Don't they
0 A:  Bo, Bo, Bohemian Rhapsody.
0 B:  Yeah, that, that was a real good one.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 money, a lot of money doing this, and then he came out with, uh, see, for
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  That was good, but it was on his way of going downhill, because he said, I
0 can make a lot of money just singing alone, and then he came out with the
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  No, not yet.  I guess I've been, con-, kind of considering it.  Have you
0 seen it yet?
0 A:  And, they both loved the movie, right? 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  No, but you learn to.  I mean it's just that, like the, the sixties music's
0 B:  Well no, now, well seventies music, I mean, I'm, like I said, yo-, disco, I
1 A:  Hey, but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants,
0 B:  That's true.  But, I was more in the late seven-, well, I shou-, like mid
0 B:  and, seventy-nine, was more my era.
0 B:  so, you know, in seventy-eight, you know rock was starting to get really
0 B:  I don't know, disco was pretty much dead by then.
0 A:  So, it's like, nothing happened during the seventies.  Everything happened
0 it's like, like the, the eighties are called, like the progressive years, or
0 B:  I just left it.  No, it's okay, because see I didn't, see somebody tried
0 A:  So then, uh, have fun doing this.  It is not,
0 places, we go out to dinner,
0 B:  Yeah, it does, an, an then, uh, you know, my husband enjoys spending time
0 A:  Yeah, we have family that's far away.  It sounds like you might too.
0 B:  Yeah, we do, so they, 
0 uh, 
0 A:  Especially since my youngest one is [sneezing], excuse me, only fourteen
0 A:  Oh that's a big thrill for them.
0 B:  yeah, or, uh, you know, go get a bag of M and M's or something like that,
0 time as we can.  We, you know our, our whole weekends are divi-, are devoted
0 to our children except for we might go out, you know, one evening or
0 B:  but during the day, you know, it's all devoted to our kids and they come,
0 A:  Have, um, have you ever been to the Science, it's called the Science Place?
0 A:  We ju-, we haven't lived here too long and we went there a couple of
0 A:  Oh, yeah, we, I guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two.
0 A:  That really seem, they really seemed to go wild in there.
0 some petting, you know, like, uh, uh, I think it's Owens Country Farms has a
0 free petting, you know, like a farm that you can go to and the kids can pet
0 animals and stuff.
0 A:  Oh yeah.
0 B:  They have tours going through there and, uh, the kids think that was a
0 B:  We take, you know, whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think it's
0 go for the, to play around and,
0 A:  That's right.
0 B:  And parents get in free and it's like, during the week, it's like five
0 dollars admission per child, all day.
0 B:  The petting farm, yeah.
0 A:  Because they can just do, you don't have to have tokens for everything.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 [laughter].
0 inexpensively as possible, so.
0 B:  Oh, no problem.  Well, take #care.#
0 A:  #Okay,# bye-bye,
0 B:  And, uh, he was a native and had gone to school there,
0 B:  and got transferred to Colorado where I was living.  Uh, and, he had
0 chemical plant down there.  I almost moved there when I was in high school.
0  
0 A:  One, uh, there was a girl in, in  my flight in, in, uh, Air Force basic
0 A:  Oh, its, I think, I think everything always sounds more glamorous than it
0 really is.  
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, I lived in Colorado for a while and people kept saying the same
0 A:  But, um, what do you think about, about, um, their situation, should
0 A:  Yeah.
0 right it will probably just kind of happen, you know.
0 B:  Yeah, it's a U S territory, and it's just we own it or, 
0 B:  And I think he was going to go back, be an engineer out there.
1 B:  He was really funny.  Both of the ones I met have been really funny guys.
0 A:  No, I have no idea, but, uh, so you think that mostly they're, they're
0 pretty much satisfied with things the way they are.
0 definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not say, okay you're a
0 A:  I think so, I think its, they want like five minutes or something, don't
0 they.
0 it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however, I think, we're
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
0 and, uh, he turned them down.  It, it's interesting that, that most people
0 and, and, uh, in fact, we went back to visit some friends of, of my fathers,
0 that we went in fifty-seven I guess.  And interestingly enough the canal is
0 The thing I find interesting, though, is that, uh, is the whole colonial
0 A:  I have a, a little bit, I can't say that I'm, I would be an, an expert on,
0 popular support, uh, the Sandinistas had to a given extent popular, uh,
0 we consider our sphere of influence and now we're, we're in this dilemma over,
0 with the, or, not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about, uh,
0 were, uh, there's a big, there's a big lake,
0 A:  Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his, uh, his family.
0 B:  Yeah, and, and the question is, does the government make a difference.  If
0 control and the, and the Spaniards have, uh, horrible history of corrupt, uh,
0 government, greedy, uh, rulers who have been, uh, manipulating, manipulating
0 horrible things they did to the, uh, the native tribes, I mean they make, uh,
0 you've still got, uh, Cuba that accepts, exerts some influence.
0 they, you know, would they be better off under communism.
0 like the street people that are starting to show up all other the U S, is
0 that,
0 may be a point at which, at which, you've, uh, you might want to consider some
0 the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy.
0 B:  Well that, yeah, if the guys got some incentive, if he's got, uh, you
0 B:  Yeah, as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical
0 to encourage, uh, or to make, to make him growing bananas profitable again, I
0 B:  Yes, but the, but the question is, you know, if somebody offered you, you
0 A:  yeah, it's tempting, it's got to be, it's got to be horribly tempting for
0 those, those peasants.
0 extra car or having a better car, this is a matter for them of, of feeding
0 problems, particularly when, when the, uh, religious organizations, you know,
0 trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves, not that they,
0 long time but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have
0 B:  Yes, very much.
0 B:  and the English mysteries.
0 A:  Yeah, I watch mysteries too.  Is that what you're referring to?
0 A:  Okay, yeah.  That is good.  I like, uh, do you read?  
0 B:  Yes.
0 television.  Any kind of, I also uh, am very fond of great performances,
0 A:  Really.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 this day.
0 B:  Well, they're showing uh, LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  So,
0 A:  Oh, he can never cut it [laughter].
0 B:  in his early movies.
0 B:  Oh yes.
1 A:  Yeah, he had my vote double [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, I know.  Well I, I, I'm not much of a television watcher.  I, I read
0 as I said,
0 A:  I'm a Payroll Clerk.  Just an accounting clerk.
0 B:  At T I?
0 B:  Oh, I see.
0 than anybody else, but I needed the money. [laughter] This is five bucks here.
0 B:  I think that's something we all ca-,
0 B:  In Maryland, yes.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  And, that's my field of work also.  
0 B:  Yes, I have. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Well, for example.  In Greek there are seven different words for love.
0 B:  Okay, so you can have, there's one word for love of your brother, one word
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  So that's, you know, you can look at it as though they are saying it's not
0 true, but there's too much historical fact involved just from the uh, the 
0 B:  You can look at it, you know, if you want to say that it's proven that it
0 isn't true, then you can very much look at it that way.
0 B:  Yeah, well,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yeah, that's right.
0 B:  But, uh, I don't know if there is, there is a time limit on this, 
0 B:  so, uh.
0 A:  You too.
0 became a state.  Uh, so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the
0 that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have
0 the Spanish was no problem.  Um, it was, it was, you know, very lovely and,
0 state woul-, statehood would improve their economy.  I don't, I don't know
0 that the ve-, the act of being a state would have any impact on, on them.  Uh,
0 thought about.  Uh, I don't know, uh, I suppose they also, not being a state
0 if, if, I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a
0 A:  Um, and taxes [laughter].
0 don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial
0 situation.  Um, frequently the laws in a territory are, are in some ways as
0 anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country so,
0 hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that
0 become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe
0 Hispanic heritage.
0 favor of, uh, status quo.
0 A:  I, I believe I would probably tend towards that.
0 think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and
0 official language as a condition for statehood.
0 against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something.
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  That's interesting because although I tend to be
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  And so, obviously it didn't work in California. 
0 B:  Um, I'm, I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I
0 guess.
0 A:  Okay, well thank you very much.
0 [breathing] North Texas [breathing] for uh, a Kinesiology program there.
0 class that he used to teach.
0 B:  I'm, I'm an avid aerobics, [breathing] uh, person and just very, very
0 exercise, but, I very rarely do things like, um, I've never done aerobics or
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  you're a calcu-, you know calculated down and do your calisthenics,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  Is that why you like aerobics classes, because you're
0 not, sort of, someone else is doing the counting for you, so, 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  it makes it less of a chore?
0 B:  so, it makes it easier for me.
0 it as a family, so,
0 B:  and, biking and I, I, I love to swim, so I love it when, you know, it's
0 swimming weather,
1 B:  all over the country.  
0 they, you know, the craze really picked up big here and before that there was
0 B:  Well, I think people are, are more inc-, um, um, people from California
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 whatever.  And, uh, oh the, the, the uni-, University of California at Berkeley
0 subscribed to, uh, newsletter,
0 that they, they combined them all together.  And, uh, so it's had that
0 health, that, the, you know, you have to have that combination, or
0 couldn't say which, which caused the other.  They sort of, dev-, you know,
0 some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them,
0 impact was, uh, people becoming interested in alternate practices, ((I'm not
0 medicine.  Uh, you have, you know, major, um, acupuncture schools and things
0 the city.
0 almost healthier, you know,
0 A:  And, that, that's,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  #Yeah am I actually.#
0 A:  I, as am I.
0 A:  you can, 
0 B:  but, in urban areas it's, you know, steak places, an,
0 up to a stop at a stop sign and completely stopped, just slid to the side of
0 A:  all across the road.  Ours if it ices over, it's thick, it's with snow,
0 almost like they're try, it's trying to skip Spring and go straight to Summer.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 buildings across the street.
0 cold but I guess I can live with it [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 and we were all dressed like eskimos and, uh, and then soon after, we had this
0 big ice storm, uh, where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice
0 A:   And, uh, we were feeling very cocky because, of course, we always, in
0 and, but you alwa-, you could expect to have this ice storm and I think there
1 B:  Well that was one reason why I figured that I could stand Lubbock, Texas.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 the winter, 
0 A:  [Laughter] Well that's the thing with us too, it's, uh, we just, you know,
0 A:  And, uh, you could expect a long winter period.  Uh, for instance, um, we
0 Boston which was and hour and a half away. 
0 A:  And I would get up at five o'clock in the morning just to shovel out the
1 A:  And that's so I could leave by seven. 
0 A:  And so now it takes me ten minutes [laughter].
0 B:  I mean employers expected people to not necessarily be there on time due
0 A:  Uh, well, then not, they didn't expect you to be on time, but they did
0 nobody is prepared to do anything about it, you know.
0 B:  Everything stops, yeah.
0 first ice, uh, storm and the place closes up.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 at work [laughter].
0 A:  There's nobody there.  Yeah, yeah, I, that happens a lot.  I, I just live
0 A:  [Laughter] Um, but, uh, yeah, 
0 weather's like that.
0 B:   Well are you, uh, do you prefer the kind of weather that
0 winters.
0 there's a lot of things we miss about New England, you know.  Uh, uh, where,
0 of land, and, um, and so we, that, now we have this, we have a house that's
0 three times as big, but we have less than a quarter acre lot, you know, and
0 B:  Sure, once you're out of the house, you're in the street.
0 when the weather was just, 
0 A:  Oh, yeah humid, very humid in New England, I mean you got hundred degree
0 A:  I, Boston's right on the water and, uh, you'd have these hundred degree
0 days where the humidity was just on-, hundred percent and it was stifling.
0 B:  Uh, you know it may be a hundred and a hundred an five or whatever, up
0 here, 
0 A:  And, uh, I'm originally from Virginia and, and my memories of summer
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  or playing with the computer,
0 A:  [Child] No, I, I do ceramics I, I, you know the pieces are made from a mold
0 and I paint them.
0 line off --
0 A:  -- you know, you scrape that off and, uh, make it as smooth as possible,
0 wanted.
0 A:  [Baby_crying].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 Disney characters.
0 B:  Huh.
0 throwing them and broke them.
0 kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them.
0 A:  I workout with them, or try to.
0 B:  #Yeah, well I really,#
0 B:  I enjoy doing that. 
0 A:  Yeah, it's fun.
0 so we're not competitive we're just having fun,
0 B:  [/Static] Uh-huh.
0 B:  Um [static].
0 A:  So, I'm not with the same softball team.  But they're starting up soon so
0 A:  And, uh,
0 A:  you know, you don't hear a lot of angry words.  
0 A:  Because, it, you know, it's a, it's a hobby you do not want to be stressed
0 A:  Yeah, well, uh, get back to computer programming of yours, --
0 uh, I'll get to about fifteen, sixteen lines and I'd mess up and it just says
0 A:  All right, thank you. 
0 B:  Sure bye-bye [/static].
0 A:  around the house.
0 tried to wear things that were comfortable, but still tried to look, you know,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  It wasn't quite business, but to give the students, um, and, made you feel
0 B:  Exactly.  Well I, I work, uh, I'm a financial analyst.  
0 B:  Uh, but, that does change in the summer, uh, they, they get a little more
0 maybe go play some golf.
0 B:  Not really, it's, uh, it's just, uh, in our small group we, uh, we, have a
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 so, um, um, he sort of funnels that down to, uh, to the people that work in
0 A:  And so that could be, the same can be said for the business office, too.
0 saying, a lot more confident in myself.
0 A:  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
0 B:  And, uh, if I do have to approach, the, uh, the controller or the vice
0 A:  And so, for me to dress in businesslike clothes, my, uh, you know, um, I, I
0 preferred slacks because we had to wa-, park pretty far [laughter].
0 A:  Yes.  And you wouldn't want to have to walk, uh, you know, in high heels,
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  I see.
0 a, uh, uh, social type party then you dress up, and that, I think, it just has
0 A:  You have a totally different wardrobe with different fabrics, 
0 the same types of things, just with a jacket or sweater or,
0 [laughter].
0 A:  Different shoes, you know, we always had, like, um, higher shoes, higher
0 then a summer.
0 A:  That is really true.  A lot of it is, um, the color, certain colors seem to
0 and so, I guess part of that is, um, just the physics of it.  That, in, what,
0 husband and I, we don't go to a lot of like where he as to wear [lipsmack]
1 A:  two holidays. 
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  That is pretty funny. It's funny that we have, as a society, go to so much
0 trouble, when we have so many other things we could be spending our time
0 thinking about [laughter].
0 B:  that we could be spending time and effort on,
0 A:  I noticed, uh, when we moved to Plano that um, the mall here, Collin Creek,
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  I don't know where you are, but um,
0 A:  Oh, you do. 
0 B:  Exactly.
0 A:  is what I'm trying to say. 
0 B:  And, uh, because I noticed that, um, like even going to church and, um,
0 B:  Right, to try to keep up with the Joneses almost. 
0 A:  and everything, everything is freshly pressed and everything.
0 @@A:  Well, I appreciate the conversation we have had about clothing. I know
0 B:  That is, so, uh, well that is great.  I appreciate the call.
0 B:  You to.
0 A:  I do not live in a city.  I live in a real small little place. 
0 A:  It's north of Sherman.
0 A:  [Laughter] Not too far.
0 B:  I'm about eight miles south of it. 
0 A:  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  I had been through Saint Joe, but, um, ((just as far as))
0 B:  tanks and all that.  
0 B:  And, they didn't kill as many people in, in forty-five days, and they were
0 B:  I mean, that was their job, as they killed in Washington D C.
0 A:  Oh, I know, I know.  I know.  Um, I think nowadays people just, really
0 B:  Well, I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years, I
0 guess.  And, I've come to the conclusion, and this is a pretty scary thought
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  -- and just let them go --
0 that, you know,
0 B:  You know. 
0 A:  Yeah.
0 accepted into society, then ((everybody's)) going to become sociopathic.
0 thing last night, up in Washington State. If you get convicted of, uh, sexual
0 B:  So you serve your prison term, and then you go into the mental hospital,
0 A:  yeah, to go ahead and let them go, but if they do it again and they
0 the people they committed a crime against, feel, at some later date, that
0 B:  Well, you look at places like Turkey. Turkey has the death penalty,
0 B:  I mean, if you get convicted of, uh, you know, drug trafficking, they just
0 A:  That is true, I know.  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Because that's what our society becomes.  We have,
0 A:  comes, yeah. 
0 that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work.
0 drink their booze and shoot their drugs and when they run out of money, they
0 B:  -- and I just said to this kid, I said, you got two choices kid, you can
0 A:  If they see violence at home, that's what you're going to get from the kids
0 to live together.  Okay.  It's in their culture.
0 B:  And one of the things that's in their culture that I really think the major
0 corporations should pay attention to, is the fact that, while Japan was
0 If they weren't fit for the job they were hired for, they didn't just can
0 them, they made a position for them some where.
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  You look at Frito Lay.  My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist.
0 B:  Well, she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute, but she
0 don't like it.  She just doesn't like to do that.  I mean, she will.
0 B:  But, you know, her preference is to be [tone] in an office situation where
1 B:  Oh, I love it.    
1 B:  That's my case also.  I've got a new born and there's just no time.
0 B:  Oh, really.    
0 A:  Not that hard.  
0 A:  I really enjoy it.   
0 B:  -- that, uh, was a real good one to do.  It was tough, but, uh, yeah.  Do
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  I just, I just keep an inventory of what I currently have, and
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.  How old?  
0 B:  He's seven months old.  
1 B:  And just into everything, so there's not a spare moment.  
0 bibs for him.
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, last year he was a little bit young for having one.
0 A:  You would have but,   
0 do it.
0 B:  -- is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the, with
0 B:  Yeah.  Those are pretty.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yeah. ((Lilly, Lilly)), she said, she said it's for your daughter to use.
0 I was like, oh, I don't want to mess those up.
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  But, uh, well keep up the good, um, keep up the cross-stitching.
0 A:  You too.  
0 thirty at night, or in the morning actually.  Um, for the past six days we've
0 lot of snow and all that and this has just been something we've, we've never
0 A:  And people that were actually were staying home, um, without any heat.
0 house without any heat.
0 the garden and we've planted our garden and,
0 B:  Yeah, we've been, you know, we've been working in the yard and our peach
0 B:  I grew up in, you know, I grew in Wyoming. I remember ice storms and,
0 A:  So, what's the lowest that the temperature would ever get there?
0 because,
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  the wind wouldn't let you walk.  It was strong.  It was really something.
0 trees, through there cars, you know, trees had fallen right on top of their
0 cars.  Um, other people had trees go right through there rooftops.
0 B:  Oh.
0 New York,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 [laughter] they call them,
0 A:  Oh, that's funny.
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  they don't slow down for nothing around here.
0 A:  That's crazy. 
0 A:  Sure. 
0 A:  Oh [laughter]. 
0 A:  I thought were saying, can you hold on?
0 A:  [Laughter] Oh, okay. 
0 A:  we, we stayed all last week with one set of friends.  And, um, they,
0 B:  You don't even have power back to your house yet? 
0 on,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  to be on the side walks because they might be some live wires,
0 B:  Oh.
0 of thing.  But one thing that was very funny was that on Monday, um, almost
0 B:  Oh.
0 A:  a freezer full of food, and that's all been,
0 B:  Destroyed.
0 B:  Yeah, you have to have some food to eat because the grocery probably ran
0 night, he mentioned the state of emergency and we all felt like finally we
0 B:  Uh-huh
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh.
0 pay phone outside of our house, um, they were sitting by the pool sipping, you
0 B:  Yeah,
0 A:  I, you know, I guess, you-, your, like the earthquake was in San Francisco?
0 A:  Remember that?  And, you know, you can hear about it on T V and you just,
0 garden,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 @B:  Uh, yeah.  As a matter of fact, I went to, uh, one of the nurseries and,
0 of different types.
0 A:  We have a couple of those too.  We, uh, we haven't planted a garden yet.
0 B:  No, I never have, uh, 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 up in Wisconsin.  They always grew a lot of vegetables but,
0 A:  It gets so hot, I just wonder, you know, what, what vegetables can really
0 B:  Um, besides, uh, gardening what other, uh, types of things are you
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Well, um, I'm not, uh, much, uh, of a woodworker myself, but my dad owns a
0 shop, and he, uh, makes quite a few, uh, arts and crafts type things out of
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 of exotic woods.
0 lately [barking].
0 B:  Yeah, they're, they're, uh, quite unique, and, uh, it's, well he's retired,
0 A:  Well, that's good.  Keeps them active, I'm sure [laughter]. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  All right. 
0 B:  I appreciate it.  #Thanks.#
0 um, when my husband went to pick him up, she, he said that the baby had been
0 B:  I bet.
0 volleyball, they have a day-care set up there for people playing volleyball,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh.
0 A:  Well, you know they're getting raised right.
0 to, from my experience be the best at what they're doing,
0 A:  in charge.  But, uh, the church, uh, day-care that my kids, they don't go
0 A:  If, uh, because if they don't like it, uh, you can't get them, that
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 don't know exactly what they,
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  and that's another problem with day-care because you're not there so you
0 don't what they're doing.
0 B:  Yeah.  They're probably, I would think, needs to be, I don't know if they
0 [laughter] worry about those things.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 a good day.
0 B:  Thank you.
0 A:  All right.  Bye-bye.
0 eat that aren't, veg-, you know, that aren't, don't contain meat products or
0 don't contain animal products but maybe aren't, you know, uh, balanced meal,
0 so to speak.  So, but we, we feel a lot better since we've become vegetarians.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  but I know what it, I know what it is so I, you know, I don't want it
0 but,
0 B:  So wa-, if you have, if you have people over would you fix all vegetables
0 uh, you can ma-, you know, make, uh, pasta meals and different things that
0 there wasn't a meat there, you know, at the, at the table, or even pizzas, you
0 B:  Yes, but that's,
0 B:  Do you eat cheese?  Do you eat li-, eggs an,
0 eggs, and that's even more difficult.  It's really hard to find the products
0 and it's hard, that's even harder to keep yourself from eating because it, it
0 A:  you know, it really makes a difference [laughter].
0 A:  Or eggs.  Yeah, eggs.  My mother just said eggs.  It's hard to find
0 A:  Yeah.  It, if, well, it really is because t-, just today we were in the
0 A:  And they actually had lentils which some stores don't have things like
0 begin with that you don't even know where in there.  So, um, [breathing] it's,
0 of times last week I went without meat, um, I had pasta and salad for two
0 days,
0 kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so
0 A:  So.
0 A:  [Laughter] Um, you prepare a lot of vegetables and there's lots of
0 A:  you just make, you ju-, 
0 they, they have the turkey, you know, they do, they ca-, they, you can't stop,
0 A:  you know, with the main meal kind of thing.  And, and I suppose, because
0 B:  [Laughter]  Even for the turkey.  Yeah,
0 A:  So, um, but it, it's interesting finding different recipes.  Although, my
0 me off, but when you read so much,
0 worth it?  And, the people, I, I really think in general, people in the United
0 the, the, the kind that you can't get from a [noise] little pill,
0 know, it's an all important thing you,
0 used that word on myself before, but I am very large and probably if I could
0 uh, yeah, I, I, I don't know that my mother and father have seen any
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good.  
0 A:  They all were, were tapped into C N N. 
0 A:  And all this week they have been having this, uh, a discussion about that
0 and, uh, they, it was, you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've
0 got, you know.
0 B:  Huh.
0 the news is being made.
0 A:  Right, right. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it's
0 B:  Gosh that's, that sounds pretty bad to me.  I mean who would steal a
0 newspaper?
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh, from Los Angeles, {pause} but I live in Raleigh, North Carolina, right
0 A:  Well, I, boy, current events is not a good subject for me. 
0 B:  So I don't know, are we suppose to, it seems to me it says you are suppose
0 A:  Hey, how you doing?
0 B:  Sure [cough].
0 A:  Because I've been, like, waiting, like, for about ten minutes to get
0 B:  No, no.  I'm in Detroit.  Or not Detroit.  I'm in, uh, California.
0 A:  Yeah.  I'm in North Carolina.
0 B:  Yeah, [laughter] okay.  All right.  Well I guess we're supposed to talk,
0 thing?
0 this and.
0 A:  Wha-, what are you working on [breathing]?
0 A:  Yeah.  That area.  And it's really small.  All, all you have is like towns
0 B:  Yeah.  So it, it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway.  Kind of quaint
0 B:  -- don't have a whole lot there.
0 A:  Oh, okay.  So, so I mean, it's like this, this town probably has like two
0 B:  Two hundred fifty?
0 B:  Okay.  It, it's, it's a lot bigger than Monterey is.  But we're just, uh,
0 A:  And they're asking like for a, uh, G P A of like three point seven or
0 A:  -- like that.  And like they're looking like for, uh, G R E like
0 ninety-nine percentile and #this and that.#
0 A:  [Swallowing] Yeah, I know.  That's why, that's why I didn't apply.  I mean,
0 A:  So, are, are you going to go for your Doctorate?
0 A:  #But, uh, but what if# they pay for it?
0 B:  Excuse me?
0 B:  If they pay for a P H D?
0 B:  #Uh-huh [popping].#
0 B:  Uh-huh [talking].
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh [barking].
0 B:  Oh, easily, #I'm sure.#
0 A:  Yeah.  But that's, uh,
0 A:  it's like, uh, in I B M.  In I B M, you can get certain points --
0 become, you know, like whatever you need to earn #so much money.#
0 A:  And so, I B M says well we have, we have to have a team, right.  
0 analyze why they came in last right.  Because the ((person)) asked for it.
0 A:  Saying, he goes, uh, the problem was that there were five people saying
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, that's the way it works.  I mean, that's, that's why they're
0 B:  I didn't realize that.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- are, uh, very few.  And then the other people just plan it, you know.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 going, you know, like what shall we do?  Has anybody thought of anything?
0 what's that?  This track which it's going around the world and they can tell
0 you know, a lock on a lot of the market.
0 A:  Which y-, you actually are like sitting around not doing anything.  So you
0 B:  Uh.
0 doing something illegally.
0 A:  #Yeah, like# if you're stealing something or doing anything like that
0 A:  But they won't let you off.  What they'll do is like [sigh] suppose, you
0 B:  -- policy.  But it does-, they don't really say that, you know, you're,
0 A:  And anybody can fix it.  
0 A:  What?
0 A:  Because I mean and by the time you have computer for five years, you're
0 going to throw it away anyway.  #You know.#
0 correct, you know, all the errors in your voice, it takes up all your memory.
0 like why do you want more.  Because it's like one second of recording.  I mean
0 [laughter] Jesus Christ.
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 seventy-six --
0 A:  This is like, #this is like# --
0 A:  -- video game stuff.  #Okay?#
0 fast that adds up, you know.
0 importance of benefits and that kind of thing, other than salary --
0 guess that's true.  I'm still young enough that, that, uh, the vacation's real
0 uh, celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and, uh, kind of
0 you know, when you're, when you're, you know, in your, I'm only in my late
0 retirement package, do you think?
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  And I disagree with you.  I don't think it's the worst investment,
0 A:  Well, it's, in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you don't
0 start looking for that word guaranteed,
0 this whole big, you know, proposal, profile for you, that, ev-, all the things
0 figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred
0 So, I guess it, you know, in that way, at least we know that that's taken care
0 of, you know.  We, we can worry about other things so,
0 A:  I understand,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know.  It,
0 A:  Uh, I can see some, some potential changes that probably are, are, would
0 A:  Such as offering a, a smorgasbord.  Having a larger variety of benefits
0 A:  to speak. 
0 in the DALLASITE or the INSITE one, about uh, companies allowing you, and
0 under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not
0 the money is actually coming out of your own pocket, but it's coming out a
0 three to one.
0 like, it depends on what, what group you happen to be in, what, what you're
0 A:  Well, that's for sure. 
0 B:  Which is the same, but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,
0 A:  in the state, do you? 
0 A:  Um.  Well. 
0 recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been
0 A:  Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it kee-,
0 A:  the feeling that it (( )) with, someone is calling for someone else to
0 B:  Yes it is.  It's a tough, tough question.  It really is.
0 be by it.
0 B:  It's not, not to me personally, no.
0 A:  Um.
0 personally,
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  closer at home you would feel, 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  Yes. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, uh, [sniffing] things
0 that happen cause a person not to,
0 A:  So, it's a little bit more humane, I guess, it is,
0 B:  Yes, absolutely. 
0 B:  It's a, it's a tough question.  It really is.  I guess, if I had to say yes
0 A:  Yes. 
0 B:  Yes, I wish I had the answer for that, everybody does. 
0 B:  Yes, it's nothing to be proud of, 
0 B:  certainly not. 
0 A:  But I, you know, we have been really fortunate our family,
0 got a summons, jury summons,
0 A:  And it's not that, I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the
0 jury, 
0 A:  involving a violent crime or anything. 
0 A:  I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important,
0 spending a year or two in, in public service.
0 countries sure need help so,
0 B:  Oh, really. 
0 just, there was very little external.  I think possibly what, uh, they're
0 thinking about here, more external Peace Corps,
0 B:  Well, I think that would be real interesting for people to do, but, I
0 guess, my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people
0 A:  Huh-uh.
0 B:  and, but, I don't know. If you did it internally and it was just people
0 be able to really, you know, send children to do that.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  I didn't know. 
0 B:  Yeah, I was too. 
0 fantastic idea.
0 A:  Wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps? 
0 B:  But it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a,
0 A:  Where they couldn't do that.  Yeah, you might end up with a revolution.  I
0 understand, from some of the guys I know, you know, crime, uh, is punishable,
0 A:  -- public, yeah.  Public hanging and this sort of thing, you know, so you
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, I guess that's, uh, the price of freedom, I guess, is a
0 A:  Um, I, I think I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  And, uh, but if, you know,
0 know, like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that.
0 B:  Might not go if it was voluntary, but I don't know how they'd enforce it,
0 B:  Yeah.

0 B:  Yeah, really there could be, um, some scandals involved, if, you know, it
0 wasn't people that were really fair and le-,
0 A:  We've gotten to the point where, you know, if, if, well, if the racial make
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 somebody else is going to scream, well, you didn't build one over here.

0 really motivate people because we live in a pr-, pr-, predominately Catholic

0 A:  Don't you?  Just massive rental.
0 A:  That's what we do, especially when it's bad weather, man, just,
0 B:  That's true.  We saw, um, HERO'S HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS, tonight.

0 A:  he wasn't in the book, 
0 B:  I didn't, see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that

0 ourselves.

0 and we've done a little work on it and, uh, I,
0 A:  Timber framing, okay well, other than, you talking about like post and beam
0 construction?
0 A:  Well, not very much other than what I read.  We don't use much of that up
0 construction with wooden siding, and, and, you know most of your homes down
0 A:  That's a typical New England home, I guess.
0 A:  Uh.
0 B:  And it's a, it's a, you know what a mansard roof is?
0 A:  Oh, okay.  That's unique.  We do a lot of truss roofs up here but they are,

0 every day back and forth to work [laughter], it, it's an eye opener,
0 B:  Right.
0 blowing about forty miles an hour right now, so, it's really, really cold
0 B:  [/Static] That's a pretty good temperature swing.
0 A:  Yeah, that's, that's a little too much though then a lot of folks catch
0 A:  Yeah, yeah I hear you [laughter].  Okay, sir.
0 A:  Yeah, and thank you much, I will talk to you again.
